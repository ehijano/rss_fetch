      <title>On Some Series Involving the Central Binomial Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a variety of series involving the central binomial coefficients, highlighting their structural properties and connections to other mathematical objects. Specifically, we derive new closed-form representations and examine the convergence properties of infinite series with a repeating alternation pattern of signs involving central binomial coefficients. More concretely, we derive the series $$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{\omega_n}}{2n+1}\tbinom{2n}{n}x^n,\,\,\, \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}{(-1)^{\omega_n}}\tbinom{2n}{n}x^n\,\,\, \text{and} \,\,\, \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}{(-1)^{\omega_n}}n\tbinom{2n}{n}x^n,$$ where $\omega_n$ represents both $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ and $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$. Also, we present novel series involving Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, deriving many interesting identities.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative and mining property for stability numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $f$-vertex stability number $vs_f(G)=\min\{|X|: X\subseteq V(G) \enspace \text{and} \enspace f(G-X)\neq f(G)\}$, and $f$-edge stability number is defined similarly by setting $X\subseteq E(G)$. In this paper, for multiplicative and mining invariant $f$, we give some general bounds for $f$-vertex/edge stability numbers of graphs and some results about the relations between the $f$-vertex/edge stability numbers of graphs and their components.</description>

      <title>Minkowski-Weyl theorem and Gordan's lemma up to symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate equivariant analogues of the Minkowski--Weyl theorem and Gordan's lemma in an infinite-dimensional setting, where cones and monoids are invariant under the action of the infinite symmetric group. Building upon the framework developed earlier, we extend the theory beyond the nonnegative case. Our main contributions include a local equivariant Minkowski--Weyl theorem, local-global principles for equivariant finite generation and stabilization of symmetric cones, and a full proof of the equivariant Gordan's lemma. We also classify non-pointed symmetric cones and non-positive symmetric normal monoids, addressing new challenges in the general setting.</description>

      <title>Which Phylogenetic Networks are Level-k Networks with Additional Arcs? Structure and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reticulate evolution gives rise to complex phylogenetic networks, making their interpretation challenging. A typical approach is to extract trees within such networks. Since Francis and Steel's seminal paper, "Which Phylogenetic Networks are Merely Trees with Additional Arcs?" (2015), tree-based phylogenetic networks and their support trees (spanning trees with the same root and leaf set as a given network) have been extensively studied. However, not all phylogenetic networks are tree-based, and for the study of reticulate evolution, it is often more biologically relevant to identify support networks rather than trees. This study generalizes Hayamizu's structure theorem for rooted binary phylogenetic networks, which yielded optimal algorithms for various computational problems on support trees, to extend the theoretical framework for support trees to support networks. This allows us to obtain a direct-product characterization of each of three sets: all, minimal, and minimum support networks, for a given network. Each characterization yields optimal algorithms for counting and generating the support networks of each type. Applications include a linear-time algorithm for finding a support network with the fewest reticulations (i.e., the minimum tier). We also provide exact and heuristic algorithms for finding a support network with the minimum level, both running in exponential time but practical across a reasonably wide range of reticulation numbers.</description>

      <title>An Ore-type theorem for $[3]$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ore's Theorem states that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph and every pair of non-adjacent vertices has degree sum at least $n$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
  A $[3]$-graph is a hypergraph in which every edge contains at most $3$ vertices. In this paper, we prove an Ore-type result on the existence of Hamiltonian Berge cycles in $[3]$-graph $\cH$, based on the degree sum of every pair of non-adjacent vertices in the $2$-shadow graph $\partial \cH$ of $\cH$. Namely, we prove that there exists a constant $d_0$ such that for all $n \geq 6$, if a $[3]$-graph $\cH$ on $n$ vertices satisfies that every pair $u,v \in V(\cH)$ of non-adjacent vertices has degree sum $d_{\partial \cH}(u) + d_{\partial \cH}(v) \geq n+d_0$, then $\cH$ contains a Hamiltonian Berge cycle. Moreover, we conjecture that $d_0=1$ suffices.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Frames and Equiangular Lines over Finite Fields and their Connections to Design Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns frames and equiangular lines over finite fields. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for systems of equiangular lines over finite fields to be equiangular tight frames (ETFs). As is the case over subfields of $\mathbb{C}$, it is necessary for the Welch bound to be saturated, but there is an additional condition required involving sums of triple products. We also prove that similar to the case over $\mathbb{C}$, collections of vectors are similar to a regular simplex essentially when the triple products of their scalar products satisfy a certain property. Finally, we investigate switching equivalence classes of frames and systems of lines focusing on systems of equiangular lines in finite orthogonal geometries with maximal incoherent sets, drawing connections to combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>Elementary symmetric polynomials under the fixed point measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a surprising inequality satisfied by elementary symmetric polynomials under the action of the fixed point measure of a random permutation. Concretely, for any collection of $n$ non-negative real numbers $a_1, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, we prove that
  \[
  \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\pi \in S_n} \left[\prod_{\{i:i=\pi(i)\}} a_i\right] \ge \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{S \in\binom{[n]}{2}} \left[ \left(\prod_{\{i \in S\}} a_i \right)^{1/2}\right],
  \]
  and this bound is sharp. To prove this elementary inequality, we construct a collection of differential operators to set up a monotone flow that then allows us to establish the inequality.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds on the Probability of a Union and on the Number of Events that Occur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ be events in a sample space. Given the probability of the intersection of each collection of up to $k+1$ of these events, what can we say about the probability that at least $r$ of the events occur? This question dates back to Boole in the 19th century, and it is well known that the odd partial sums of the Inclusion- Exclusion formula provide upper bounds, while the even partial sums provide lower bounds. We give a combinatorial characterization of the error in these bounds and use it to derive a very simple proof of the strongest possible bounds of a certain form, as well as a couple of improved bounds. The new bounds use more information than the classical Bonferroni-type inequalities, and are often sharper.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic uniform distribution of subset sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$, and for each $a\in G$ and integer $1\le h\le n$ let $\mathcal{F}_a(h)$ denote the family of all $h$-element subsets of $G$ whose sum is $a$. A problem posed by Katona and Makar-Limanov is to determine whether the minimum and maximum sizes of the families $\mathcal{F}_a(h)$ (as $a$ ranges over $G$) become asymptotically equal as $n\rightarrow \infty$ when $h=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$. We affirmatively answer this question and in fact show that the same asymptotic equality holds for every $4\leq h\leq \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+1$.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory for vertex-weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chung-Langlands established a matrix-tree theorem for positive-real valued vertex-weighted graphs, and Wu-Feng-Sato developed a theory of Ihara zeta functions for those graphs. In this paper, generalizing and refining these previous works, we initiate the Iwasawa theory for vertex-weighted graphs, which is a generalization of the Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res independently. First, we generalize the matrix-tree theorem by Chung-Langlands to arbitrary field-valued vertex-weighted graphs. Second, we refine and prove the so-called decomposition formula for vertex-weighted graphs and edge-weighted graphs without any assumption. Applying these results, we prove the Iwasawa-type formula and Kida's formula for $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers of vertex-weighted graphs. Our refinement of the decomposition formulas allows us to estimate the root-wise growth of weighted complexities in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers. We also provide several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized spectral characterization of signed bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be an $n$-vertex controllable or almost controllable signed bipartite graph, and let $\Delta_\Sigma$ denote the discriminant of its characteristic polynomial $\chi(\Sigma; x)$. We prove that if (\rmnum{1}) the integer $2^{ -\lfloor n/2 \rfloor }\sqrt{\Delta _{\Sigma}}$ is squarefree, and (\rmnum{2}) the constant term (even $n$) or linear coefficient (odd $n$) of $\chi(\Sigma; x)$ is $\pm 1$, then $\Sigma$ is determined by its generalized spectrum. This result extends a recent theorem of Ji, Wang, and Zhang [Electron. J. Combin. 32 (2025), \#P2.18], which established a similar criterion for signed trees with irreducible characteristic polynomials.</description>

For a tree $T=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ vertices and $m=|E|$ edges, we provide several bounds and exact formulas for these two topological indices, and we show that the Albertson index $\irr(T)$ and the first Zagreb index $M_1(T)$ satisfy the association \[ \operatorname{irr}(T)=d_1^2+d_n^2+(n-2)\left(\frac{\Delta + \delta}{2}\right)^2+\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} d_i+d_n - d_1-2n-2.\] Our goal of this paper is provide a topological indices, Albertson index, Sigma index among a degree sequence $\mathscr{D}=(d_1,\dots,d_n)$ where it is non-increasing and non-decreasing of tree $T$.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration in King Graphs by Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the enumeration of independent sets in king graphs of size $m \times n$, based on the tensor network contractions algorithm given in reference~\cite{tilEnum}. We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$.
  Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well.
  Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-matchability in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sch\"onberger (1934) showed that every 2-connected cubic graph is matching covered. For a vertex $v$ of a 2-connected cubic graph $G$, a $v$-matching is a spanning subgraph in which $v$ has degree three whereas every other vertex has degree one; we say that $v$ is $\lambda$-matchable if $G$ admits a $v$-matching, and we let $\lambda(G)$ denote the number of such vertices. Clearly, no vertex is $\lambda$-matchable in bipartite graphs; we instead consider $\lambda$-matchable pairs defined analogously; we let $\rho$ denote the number of such pairs.
  Chen, Lu and Zhang [Discrete Math., 2025] studied $\lambda$-matchability and showed constants lower bounds on $\lambda$ and $\rho$. We establish stronger lower bounds that feature matching-theoretic invariants that arise from the work of Lov\'asz.
  Lov\'asz [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1987] proved that every matching covered graph $G$ admits a `unique decomposition' into special ones called `braces' (bipartite) and `bricks' (nonbipartite); $b(G)$ denotes the number of its bricks, $\beta(G)$ denotes the sum of the orders of its bricks, $b'(G)$ denotes the number of its braces of order six or more, and $\beta'(G):=\sum \left(\frac{n(H)}{2}\right)^2$, wherein the sum is over all its braces $H$ of order six or more.
  We prove that 3-connected cubic graphs satisfy $\lambda \geq \beta$, and that the bipartite ones satisfy $\rho \geq \beta'+3b'-3 \geq 3n-9$. We use the fact that every 2-connected cubic graph admits a `unique decomposition' into 3-connected ones to extend our bounds. We show that the same bound $\lambda \geq \beta$ holds for all 2-connected cubic graphs, and we also characterize those that satisfy $\lambda=n$. Our generalized lower bounds on $\rho$, in the case of bipartite graphs, feature invariants that rely on the aforementioned decomposition. For each bound, we characterize all tight examples.</description>

      <title>Algebro-combinatorial generalizations of the Victoir method for constructing weighted designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weighted $t$-design in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a finite weighted set that exactly integrates all polynomials of degree at most $t$ with respect to a given probability measure. A fundamental problem is to construct weighted $t$-designs with as few points as possible. Victoir (2004) proposed a method to reduce the size of weighted $t$-designs while preserving the $t$-design property by using combinatorial objects such as combinatorial designs or orthogonal arrays with two levels. In this paper, we give an algebro-combinatorial generalization of both Victoir's method and its variant by the present authors (2014) in the framework of Euclidean polynomial spaces, enabling us to reduce the size of weighted designs obtained from the classical product rule. Our generalization allows the use of orthogonal arrays with arbitrary levels, whereas Victoir only treated the case of two levels. As an application, we present a construction of equi-weighted $5$-designs with $O(d^4)$ points for product measures such as Gaussian measure $\pi^{-d/2} e^{-\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2} dx_1 \cdots dx_d$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or equilibrium measure $\pi^{-d} \prod_{i=1}^d (1-x_i^2)^{-1/2} dx_1 \cdots dx_d$ on $(-1,1)^d$, where $d$ is any integer at least 5. The construction is explicit and does not rely on numerical approximations. Moreover, we establish an existence theorem of Gaussian $t$-designs with $N$ points for any $t \geq 2$, where $N&lt; q^{t}d^{t-1}=O(d^{t-1})$ for fixed sufficiently large prime power $q$. As a corollary of this result, we give an improvement of a famous theorem by Milman (1988) on isometric embeddings of the classical finite-dimensional Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Treewidth versus clique number. V. Further connections with tree-independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph classes, that is, hereditary graph classes in which large treewidth is witnessed by the presence of a large clique, and the relation of this property to boundedness of the tree-independence number, a graph parameter introduced independently by Yolov in 2018 and by Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel in 2024. Dallard et al. showed that bounded tree-independence number is sufficient for $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness, and conjectured that the converse holds. While this conjecture has been recently disproved, it is still interesting to determine classes where the conjecture holds; for example, the conjecture is still open for graph classes excluding an induced star, as well as for finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs. In this paper, we identify further families of graph classes where $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness is equivalent to bounded tree-independence number. We settle a number of cases of finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, obtain several equivalent characterizations of $(tw, \omega)$-boundedness in subclasses of the class of complements of line graphs, and give a short proof of a recent result of Ahn, Gollin, Huynh, and Kwon [SODA 2025] establishing bounded tree-independence number for graphs excluding a fixed induced star and a fixed number of independent cycles.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\H{o}s theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known result of Chv\'{a}tal and Erd\H{o}s from 1972 states that a graph with connectivity not less than its independence number plus one is hamiltonian-connected. A graph $G$ is called an $[s,t]$-graph if any induced subgraph of $G$ of order $s$ has size at least $t.$ We prove that every $k$-connected $[k+1,2]$-graph is hamiltonian-connected except $kK_1\vee G_{k},$ where $k\ge 2$ and $G_{k}$ is an arbitrary graph of order $k.$ This generalizes the Chv\'{a}tal-Erd\H{o}s theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called bivalent or trivalent if there exists an eigenvector of the graph Laplacian composed from {-1,1} or {-1,0,1}, respectively. These bivalent and trivalent eigenvectors are important for engineering applications, in particular for vibrating systems. In this article, we determine the structure of bivalent and trivalent graphs in the following planar graph families: trees, unicyclic, bicyclic, and cactus.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the Ramsey numbers $R(3,k)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound for the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, \[ R(3,k) \geq \bigg( \frac{1}{3}+ o(1) \bigg) \frac{k^2}{\log k }\, , \] thereby narrowing the gap between the upper and lower bounds to a factor of $3+o(1)$. This improves the best known lower bound of $(1/4+o(1))k^2/\log k$ due, independently, to Bohman and Keevash, and Fiz Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris, resulting from their celebrated analysis of the triangle-free process. As a consequence, we disprove a conjecture of Fiz Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris that the constant $1/4$ is sharp.</description>

      <title>On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
  In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model.
  Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the cokernels of random row-sparse integral matrices $A_n$ according to the determinantal measure from a structured matrix $B_n$ with a parameter $k_n \ge 3$. Under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $k_n$, we prove that the distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ converges to that of Cohen--Lenstra for every prime $p$. Our result extends the work of A. M\'esz\'aros which established convergence to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution when $p \ge 5$ and $k_n=3$ for all positive integers $n$.</description>

      <title>Peak state transfer in continuous quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study peak state transfer, a notion of high state transfer in qubit networks modeled by continuous-time quantum walks. Unlike perfect or pretty good state transfer, peak state transfer does not require fidelity arbitrarily close to 1, but crucially allows for an explicit determination of the time at which transfer occurs. We provide a spectral characterization of peak state transfer, which allows us to find many examples of peak state transfer, and we also establish tight lower bounds on fidelity and success probability. As a central example, we construct a family of weighted path graphs that admit peak state transfer over arbitrarily long distances with transfer probability approaching $\pi/4 \approx 0.78$. These graphs offer exponentially improved sensitivity over known perfect state transfer examples such as the weighted paths related to hypercubes, making them practical candidates for efficient quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Extending P\'olya's random walker beyond probability I. Complex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in combinatorial model $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$, $d=1,2,\dots$, of P\'olya's random walker in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we prove two theorems on recurrence to a vertex. We obtain an effective version of the first theorem in case $d=2$. Using a semi-formal approach to generating functions, we extend both theorems beyond probability to a more general model $\mathrm{W_{\mathbb{C}}}$ with complex weights. We relate models $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$ to standard models $\mathrm{W_{Ma}}(d)$ based on Markov chains. The follow-up article will treat non-Archimedean models $\mathrm{W_{fo}}(k)$ in which weights are formal power series in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]]$.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of complementary set partitions, with applications to an extension and estimation of generalized cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops new combinatorial approaches to analyze and compute special set partitions, called complementary set partitions, which are fundamental in the study of generalized cumulants. Moving away from traditional graph-based and algebraic methods, a simple and fast algorithm is proposed to list complementary set partitions based on two-block partitions, making the computation more accessible and implementable also in non-symbolic programming languages like R. Computational comparisons in Maple demonstrate the efficiency of the proposal. Additionally the notion of generalized cumulant is extended using multiset subdivisions and multi-index partitions to include scenarios with repeated variables and to address more sophisticated dependence structures. A formula is provided that expresses generalized multivariate cumulants as linear combinations of multivariate cumulants, weighted by coefficients that admit a natural combinatorial interpretation. Finally, the introduction of dummy variables and specialized multi-index partitions enables an efficient procedure for estimating generalized multivariate cumulants with a substantial reduction in data power sums involved.</description>

Abstract: In 1962, Gale and Shapley \cite{GS} introduced the concept of stable marriages and proved their existence. Since then, the statement of the stability problem has been highly generalized. And a lot of proofs has emerged for the existence in these more general statements. It's time to review them and identify the similarities and differences. First, we will briefly discuss the classical case, because the existence proofs in the general case grew out of it. Or rather, from the idea of "deferred acceptance". When the best of the proposed contracts is temporarily retained until a better offer is received.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic properties of MacMahon-type sums of divisors: the odd case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced two families of generating functions, $$ \sum_{1\leq n_1&lt;n_2&lt;\cdots&lt;n_t}\prod_{k=1}^t\frac{q^{n_k}}{(1-q^{n_k})^2} \quad\text{ and } \sum_{\substack{1\leq n_1&lt;n_2&lt;\cdots&lt;n_t\\ \text{$n_1,n_2,\dots,n_t$ odd}}}\prod_{k=1}^t\frac{q^{n_k}}{(1-q^{n_k})^2}, $$ which connect sum-of-divisors functions and integer partitions. These have recently drawn renewed attention. In particular, Amdeberhan, Andrews, and Tauraso extended the first family above by defining $$ U_t(a,q):=\sum_{1\leq n_1&lt;n_2&lt;\cdots&lt;n_t}\prod_{k=1}^t\frac{q^{n_k}}{1+aq^{n_k}+q^{2n_k}} $$ for $a=0, \pm1, \pm2$ and investigated various properties, including some congruences satisfied by the coefficients of the power series representations for $U_t(a,q)$. These arithmetic aspects were subsequently expanded upon by the authors of the present work. Our goal here is to generalize the second family of generating functions, where the sums run over odd integers, and then apply similar techniques to show new infinite families of Ramanujan--like congruences for the associated power series coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Necessary Condition for Connectedness of Solutions to Integer Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integer linear system is a set of inequalities with integer constraints. The solution graph of an integer linear system is an undirected graph defined on the set of feasible solutions to the integer linear system. In this graph, a pair of feasible solutions is connected by an edge if the Hamming distance between them is one. In this paper, we consider a condition under which the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector. First, we prove that if the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector, then the coefficient matrix of the system does not contain some forbidden pattern as a submatrix. Next, we prove that if at least one of (i) the number of rows is at most 3, (ii) the number of columns is at most 2, (iii) the number of rows is 4 and the number of columns is 3 holds, then the condition that the coefficient matrix of the system does not contain the forbidden pattern is a sufficient condition under which the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector. This result is stronger than a known necessary and sufficient condition since the set of coefficient matrix dimensions is strictly larger.</description>

      <title>A near-optimal Quadratic Goldreich-Levin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a quadratic Goldreich-Levin algorithm that is close to optimal in the following ways. Given a bounded function $f$ on the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the algorithm returns a quadratic polynomial $q: \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{F}_2$ so that the correlation of $f$ with the function $(-1)^q$ is within an additive $\varepsilon$ of the maximum possible correlation with a quadratic phase function. The algorithm runs in $O_\varepsilon(n^3)$ time and makes $O_\varepsilon(n^2\log n)$ queries to $f$, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ queries up to a logarithmic factor.
  As a result, we obtain a number of corollaries:
  - A near-optimal self-corrector of quadratic Reed-Muller codes, which makes $O_\varepsilon(n^2\log n)$ queries to a Boolean function $f$ and returns a quadratic polynomial $q$ whose relative Hamming distance to $f$ is within $\varepsilon$ of the minimum distance.
  - An algorithmic polynomial inverse theorem for the order-3 Gowers uniformity norm.
  - An algorithm that makes a polynomial number of queries to a bounded function $f$ and decomposes $f$ as a sum of poly$(1/\varepsilon)$ quadratic phase functions and error terms of order $\varepsilon$.
  Our algorithm is obtained using ideas from recent work on quantum learning theory. Its construction deviates from previous approaches based on algorithmic proofs of the inverse theorem for the order-3 uniformity norm (and in particular does not rely on the recent resolution of the polynomial Fre\u{\i}man-Ruzsa conjecture).</description>

      <description>arXiv:1411.0285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monsky proved that a square cannot be dissected into an odd number of triangles of equal area. Stein conjectured that the same holds for any polygon whose edges can be paired into parallel and equal-length segments. We prove Stein's conjecture under an assumption that all triangle vertices have rational coordinates. Our result is derived from a more general property of trivalent graphs equipped with a $\mathbb{Q}^2$-valued flow.</description>

      <title>About posets for which no lower cover or no upper cover has the fixed point property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.09431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite non-empty set $X$, let $\mathfrak{P}(X)$ denote the set of all posets with carrier $X$, ordered by inclusion of their partial order relations. We investigate properties of posets $P \in \mathfrak{P}(X)$ for which no lower cover or no upper cover in $\mathfrak{P}(X)$ has the fixed point property. We derive two conditions, one of them sufficient for that no lower cover of $P$ has the fixed point property, the other one sufficient for that no upper cover of $P$ has the fixed point property. If $P$ itself has the fixed point property, the conditions are even equivalent to the respective total lack of lower or upper covers with the fixed point property. We use the results to confirm a conjecture of Schr\"{o}der.</description>

      <title>Filling a triangulation of the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Define the tet-volume of a triangulation of the 2-sphere to be the minimum number of tetrahedra in a 3-complex of which it is the boundary, and let $d(v)$ be the maximum tet-volume for $v$-vertex triangulations. In 1986 Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston (STT) proved that $d(v) = 2v-10$ holds for large $v$, and conjectured that it holds for all $v \geq 13$. Their proof used hyperbolic polyhedra of large volume. They suggested using more general notions of volume instead. In work that was all but lost, Mathieu and Thurston used this approach to outline a combinatorial proof of the STT asymptotic result. Here we use a much simplified version of their approach to prove the full conjecture. This implies STT's weaker conjecture, proven by Pournin in 2014, characterizing the maximum rotation distance between trees.</description>

      <title>Truncated theta series from the Bailey lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2012, Andrews and Merca obtained a truncated version of Euler's pentagonal number theorem and showed the nonnegativity related to partition functions. Meanwhile, Andrews-Merca and Guo-Zeng independently conjectured that the truncated Jacobi triple product series has nonnegative coefficients, which has been confirmed analytically and also combinatorially. In 2022, Merca proposed a stronger version for this conjecture. In this paper, by applying Agarwal, Andrews and Bressoud's Bailey lattice, we derive a truncated version for the Jacobi triple product series with odd basis which reduces to the Andrews-Gordon identity as a special instance. As consequences, we obtain new truncated forms for Euler's pentagonal number theorem, Gauss'theta series on triangular numbers and square numbers, which lead to inequalities for certain partition functions. Moreover, by considering a truncated theta series involving $\ell$-regular partitions, we confirm a conjecture proposed by Ballantine and Merca about 6-regular partitions and show that Merca's stronger conjecture on truncated Jacobi triple product series holds when $R = 3S$ for $S \geq 1.$</description>

      <title>An El-Zahar Type Theorem in $3$-graphs under Codegree Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $3$-uniform loose cycle, denoted by $C_t$, is a $3$-graph on $t$ vertices whose vertices can be arranged cyclically so that each hyperedge consists of three consecutive vertices, and any two consecutive hyperedges share exactly one vertex. The length of $C_t$ is the number of its hyperedges. We prove that for any $\eta&gt;0$, there exists an $n_0=n_0(\eta)$ such that for any $n\geq n_0$ the following holds. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $3$-graph consisting of vertex-disjoint loose cycles $C_{n_1}, C_{n_2}, \ldots, C_{n_r}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{r}n_i=n$. Let $k$ be the number of loose cycles with odd lengths in $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{H}$ is a $3$-graph on $n$ vertices with minimum codegree at least $(n+2k)/4+\eta n$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains $\mathcal{C}$ as a spanning subhypergraph. The degree condition is approximately tight. This generalizes the result of K\"{u}hn and Osthus for loose Hamilton cycle and the result of Mycroft for loose cycle factors in $3$-graphs. Our proof relies on the regularity lemma and a transversal blow-up lemma recently developed by the first author and Staden.</description>

Abstract: What is the maximum length ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma)$ of a facial cycle of an inclusion-maximal graph with girth at least $\ell$ embedded on a given surface $\Sigma$? If $\Sigma=\mathcal{P}$ is a plane, we show that $3\ell-11\leq {\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \mathcal{P})\leq 8\ell-13$. We also prove that ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma)$ is bounded for any integer $\ell$ and any closed surface $\Sigma$. For a fixed $\Sigma$, we show that $\Omega(\ell) ={\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma) = O(\ell^2)$, while for a fixed $\ell\ge 6$, ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma)=\Theta(g)$, where $g$ is the genus of $\Sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph family $\mathcal F$, let $\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{spex}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the maximum number of edges and maximum spectral radius of an $n$-vertex $\mathcal F$-free graph, respectively, and let $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ and $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)$ denote the corresponding sets of extremal graphs. Wang, Kang, and Xue showed that if $\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ consists of Tur\'an graphs $T_{n,r}$ plus $O(1)$ edges, then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough. Fang, Tait, and Zhai extended this result by showing if $e(T_{n,r})\le\mathrm{ex}(n,\mathcal F) &lt; e(T_{n,r})+\lfloor n/2r\rfloor$ then $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,\mathcal F)\subseteq\mathrm{EX}(n,\mathcal F)$ for $n$ large enough. In this paper we extend the result further and for many values of $r$ we can show that our result is best possible, answering a question of Fang, Tait, and Zhai.</description>

      <title>Some new Steiner designs $S(2,6,91)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kramer-Mesner method for constructing designs with a prescribed automorphism group $G$ has proven effective many times. In the special case of Steiner designs, the task reduces to solving an exact cover problem, with the advantage that fast backtracking solvers like Donald Knuth's dancing links and dancing cells can be used. We find ways to encode the inherent symmetry of the problem space, induced by the action of the normalizer of $G$, into a single instance of the exact cover problem. This eliminates redundant computations of certain isomorphic search branches, while preventing the overhead caused by repeatedly restarting the solver.
  Our improved approach is applied to the parameters $S(2,6,91)$. Previously, only four such Steiner designs were known, all of which had been constructed as cyclic designs over four decades ago. We find $23$ new designs, each with full automorphism group of order $84$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, Yoshida et al. developed tropical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, an analogue of the classical PCA in the setting of tropical geometry and applied it to visualize a set of gene trees over a space of phylogenetic trees which is an union of lower dimensional polyhedral cones in an Euclidean space with its dimension $m(m-1)/2$ where $m$ is the number of leaves. In this paper, we introduce a projected gradient descent method to estimate the tropical principal polytope over the space of phylogenetic trees and we apply it to apicomplexa dataset. With computational experiment against MCMC samplers, we show that our projected gradient descent has a lower sum of tropical distances between observations and their projections on an estimated best-fit tropical polytope compared with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach proposed by Page et al.</description>

As an application, we obtain ultra log-concavity and unimodality for the number of Borel orbits in Types AIII and CII.

      <title>Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon\in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$. We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of multi-layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$. This result is related to the Beckman-Quarles theorem of 1953 that any unit-preserving mapping of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an isometry, and to the rational analogue of this theorem obtained by A. Sokolov in 2023.</description>

      <title>Ordinary and spectral extremal problems on vertex disjoint copies of even fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(n, F)$ and $\mathrm{spex}(n, F)$ be the maximum size and spectral radius among all $F$-free graphs with fixed order $n$, respectively. A fan is a graph $P_1\vee P_{s}$ (join of a vertex and a path of order $s$) for $s\ge 3$, and it is called an even fan if $s$ is even. In this paper, we study $\mathrm{ex}(n,t(P_1\vee P_{2k}))$, $\mathrm{spex}(n,t(P_1\vee P_{2k}))$ with $t\ge 1$ and $k\ge 3$ and characterize the corresponding extremal graphs for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>A note on hypergraph extensions of Mantel's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chao and Yu introduced an entropy method for hypergraph Tur\'an problems, and used it to show that the family of $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ $k$-uniform tents have Tur\'an density $k!/k^k$. Il'kovi\v{c} and Yan improved this by reducing to a subfamily of $\lceil k/e\rceil$ tents. In this note, enhancing Il'kovi\v{c}-Yan's result, we give a significantly shorter entropy proof, with optimal bounds within this framework.</description>

      <title>Singular plane curves: freeness and combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on various aspects of singular complex plane curves, mostly in the context of their homological properties and the associated combinatorial structures. We formulate some challenging open problems that can point to new directions in research, for example by introducing weak Ziegler pairs of curve arrangements. Moreover, we construct new examples of different Ziegler pairs, in both the classical and the weak sense, and present new geometric approaches to construction problems of singular plane curves.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Infrared Subtractions &amp; Infrared-Safe Computables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</description>
