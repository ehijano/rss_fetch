      <title>Lifting maps between graphs to embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study conditions for the existence of an embedding $\widetilde{f} \colon P \to Q \times \mathbb{R}$ such that $f = \mathrm{pr}_Q \circ \widetilde{f}$, where $f \colon P \to Q$ is a piecewise linear map between polyhedra. Our focus is on non-degenerate maps between graphs, where non-degeneracy means that the preimages of points are finite sets.
  We introduce combinatorial techniques and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the general case. Using these results, we demonstrate that the problem of the existence of a lifting reduces to testing the satisfiability of a 3-CNF formula. Additionally, we construct a counterexample to a result by V. Po\'{e}naru on lifting of smooth immersions to embeddings.
  Furthermore, by establishing connections between the stated problem and the approximability by embeddings, we deduce that, in the case of generic maps from a tree to a segment, a weaker condition becomes sufficient for the existence of a lifting.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Packing, Covering and Partitioning Simple Polygons with Unit Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that packing axis-aligned unit squares into a simple polygon $P$ is NP-hard, even when $P$ is an orthogonal and orthogonally convex polygon with half-integer coordinates. It has been known since the early 80s that packing unit squares into a polygon with holes is NP-hard~[Fowler, Paterson, Tanimoto, Inf. Process. Lett., 1981], but the version without holes was conjectured to be polynomial-time solvable more than two decades ago~[Baur and Fekete, Algorithmica, 2001].
  Our reduction relies on a new way of reducing from \textsc{Planar-3SAT}. Interestingly, our geometric realization of a planar formula is non-planar. Vertices become rows and edges become columns, with crossings being allowed. The planarity ensures that all endpoints of rows and columns are incident to the outer face of the resulting drawing. We can then construct a polygon following the outer face that realizes all the logic of the formula geometrically, without the need of any holes.
  This new reduction technique proves to be general enough to also show hardness of two natural covering and partitioning problems, even when the input polygon is simple. We say that a polygon $Q$ is \emph{small} if $Q$ is contained in a unit square. We prove that it is NP-hard to find a minimum number of small polygons whose union is $P$ (covering) and to find a minimum number of pairwise interior-disjoint small polygons whose union is $P$ (partitioning), when $P$ is an orthogonal simple polygon with half-integer coordinates. This is the first partitioning problem known to be NP-hard for polygons without holes, with the usual objective of minimizing the number of pieces.</description>

      <title>Projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on sheaf theory, we introduce the notions of projected barcodes and projected distances for multi-parameter persistence modules. Projected barcodes are defined as derived pushforward of persistence modules onto $\mathbb{R}$. Projected distances come in two flavors: the integral sheaf metrics (ISM) and the sliced convolution distances (SCD). We conduct a systematic study of the stability of projected barcodes and show that the fibered barcode is a particular instance of projected barcodes. We prove that the ISM and the SCD provide lower bounds for the convolution distance. Furthermore, we show that the $\gamma$-linear ISM and the $\gamma$-linear SCD which are projected distances tailored for $\gamma$-sheaves can be computed using TDA software dedicated to one-parameter persistence modules. Moreover, the time and memory complexity required to compute these two metrics are advantageous since our approach does not require computing nor storing an entire $n$-persistence module.</description>
