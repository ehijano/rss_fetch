      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic stress-energy tensor is a direct consequence of 3- and 6-dimensional left-and right-helical representations of the Lorentz group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review 3-d reducible representation of the Lorentz group and introduce a 6-d irreducible representation tailored for transforming 6-d electromagnetic vector, and we show that the mixture of the density matrices associated with the left- and right-helical states is equivalent to the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <title>Critical and tricritical behavior of the $d=3$ Blume-Capel model: Results from small-scale Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the critical and tricritical points of the three-dimensional Blume-Capel model by analyzing the behavior of the first Lee-Yang zero, the density of partition function zeros, and higher-order cumulants of the magnetization. Our analysis is conducted through Monte Carlo simulations, intentionally using only small system sizes. We demonstrate that this approach yields excellent results for studying the critical behavior of the model. Our findings indicate that at the tricritical point, where logarithmic corrections are anticipated, the numerical results align closely with the theoretical exponents describing these corrections. These expected values are then employed to accurately determine the coordinates of the tricritical point. At the model's critical point, the corrections correspond to those of the three-dimensional Ising model criticality, which we also use to precisely ascertain the critical temperature at zero crystal field. Additionally, we utilize more traditional thermodynamic quantities to validate the self-consistency of our analysis.</description>
