      <title>A Likelihood-Based Generative Approach for Spatially Consistent Precipitation Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for precipitation downscaling. However, current models rely on likelihood-based loss functions to properly model the precipitation distribution, leading to spatially inconsistent projections when sampling. This work explores a novel approach by fusing the strengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models. As a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for precipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of ocean surface wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper continues to study the long-standing problem of quasi 1-D (one dimensional) spectrum of sea surface wave turbulence. The study is based on Hasselmann's kinetic equation, which significantly simplifies for the quasi 1-D turbulence. The goal of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions with experimental observations. The paper starts with new derivation of the quasi 1-D approximation of Hasselmann's equation. The present work does not support the imposition of boundary conditions. Instead, the family of theoretical spectra is compared with P-M (Pierson-Moskowitz) and JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectra. First, a simple solution (first approximation) of the quasi 1-D equation is obtained and compared with the P-M spectrum. Then self-similar solutions are considered; they are shown to satisfy the second order ordinary differential equation. The solutions of this equation have many features of the JONSWAP spectra.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of resilience of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) given the many indications that this dynamical system is in a multi-stable regime. A novel approach to resilience based on rare event techniques is presented which leads to a measure capturing `resistance to change` and `ability to return' aspects in a probabilistic way. The application of this measure to a conceptual model demonstrates its suitability for assessing AMOC resilience but also shows its potential use in many other non-autonomous dynamical systems. This framework is then extended to compute the probability that the AMOC undergoes a transition conditioned on an external forcing. Such conditional probability can be estimated by exploiting the information available when computing the resilience of this system. This allows us to provide a probabilistic view on safe operating spaces by defining a conditional safe operating space as a subset of the parameter space of the (possibly transient) imposed forcing.</description>

      <title>Improving ensemble extreme precipitation forecasts using generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble post-processing method is developed to improve the probabilistic forecasts of extreme precipitation events across the conterminous United States (CONUS). The method combines a 3-D Vision Transformer (ViT) for bias correction with a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) method, to post-process 6-hourly precipitation ensemble forecasts and produce an enlarged generative ensemble that contains spatiotemporally consistent precipitation trajectories. These trajectories are expected to improve the characterization of extreme precipitation events and offer skillful multi-day accumulated and 6-hourly precipitation guidance. The method is tested using the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) precipitation forecasts out to day 6 and is verified against the Climate-Calibrated Precipitation Analysis (CCPA) data. Verification results indicate that the method generated skillful ensemble members with improved Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Skill Scores (CRPSSs) and Brier Skill Scores (BSSs) over the raw operational GEFS and a multivariate statistical post-processing baseline. It showed skillful and reliable probabilities for events at extreme precipitation thresholds. Explainability studies were further conducted, which revealed the decision-making process of the method and confirmed its effectiveness on ensemble member generation. This work introduces a novel, generative-AI-based approach to address the limitation of small numerical ensembles and the need for larger ensembles to identify extreme precipitation events.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Modeling and Hindcasting Lake Michigan Ice Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large lakes, ice cover plays an important role in shipping and navigation, coastal erosion, regional weather and climate, and aquatic ecosystem function. In this study, a novel deep learning model for ice cover concentration prediction in Lake Michigan is introduced. The model uses hindcasted meteorological variables, water depth, and shoreline proximity as inputs, and NOAA ice charts for training, validation, and testing. The proposed framework leverages Convolution Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies between model input and output to simulate daily ice cover at 0.1{\deg} resolution. The model performance was assessed through lake-wide average metrics and local error metrics, with detailed evaluations conducted at six distinct locations in Lake Michigan. The results demonstrated a high degree of agreement between the model's predictions and ice charts, with an average RMSE of 0.029 for the daily lake-wide average ice concentration. Local daily prediction errors were greater, with an average RMSE of 0.102. Lake-wide and local errors for weekly and monthly averaged ice concentrations were reduced by almost 50% from daily values. The accuracy of the proposed model surpasses currently available physics-based models in the lake-wide ice concentration prediction, offering a promising avenue for enhancing ice prediction and hindcasting in large lakes.</description>

      <title>On the importance of learning non-local dynamics for stable data-driven climate modeling: A 1D gravity wave-QBO testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques, especially neural networks (NNs), have shown promise in learning subgrid-scale (SGS) parameterizations for climate modeling. However, a major problem with data-driven parameterizations, particularly those learned with supervised algorithms, is instability when integrated with numerical solvers of large-scale processes. Current remedies are often ad-hoc and lack a theoretical foundation. Here, we combine ML theory and climate physics to address a source of instability in NN-based parameterization. We demonstrate the importance of learning spatially non-local dynamics using a 1D model of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) with gravity wave (GW) parameterization as a testbed. While common offline metrics fail to identify shortcomings in learning non-local dynamics, we show that the receptive field (RF)-the region of the input an NN uses to predict an output-can identify instability a-priori. We find that NN-based parameterizations that seem to accurately predict GW forcings from wind profiles ($\mathbf{R^2 \approx 0.99}$) cause unstable simulations when RF is too small to capture the non-local dynamics, while NNs of the same size but large-enough RF are stable. Some architectures, e.g., Fourier neural operators, have inherently large RF. We also demonstrate that learning non-local dynamics can be crucial for the stability and accuracy of a data-driven spatiotemporal emulator of the entire zonal wind field. Given the ubiquity of non-local dynamics in the climate system, we expect the use of effective RF, which can be computed for any NN architecture, to be important for many applications. This work highlights the need to integrate ML theory with physics for designing/analyzing data-driven algorithms for weather/climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Leveraging data-driven weather models for improving numerical weather prediction skill through large-scale spectral nudging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational meteorological forecasting has long relied on physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Recently, this landscape has been disrupted by the advent of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather models, which offer tremendous computational performance and competitive forecasting skill. However, data-driven models for medium-range forecasting generally suffer from major limitations, including low effective resolution and a narrow range of predicted variables. This study illustrates the relative strengths and weaknesses of these competing paradigms using the GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale) and GraphCast models to represent physics-based and AI-based approaches, respectively. By analyzing global predictions from these two models against observations and analyses in both physical and spectral spaces, this study demonstrates that GraphCast-predicted large scales outperform GEM, particularly for longer lead times. Building on this insight, a hybrid NWP-AI system is proposed, wherein GEM-predicted large-scale state variables are spectrally nudged toward GraphCast predictions, while allowing GEM to freely generate fine-scale details critical for weather extremes. Results indicate that this hybrid approach is capable of leveraging the strengths of GraphCast to enhance the prediction skill of the GEM model. Importantly, trajectories of tropical cyclones are predicted with enhanced accuracy without significant changes in intensity. Furthermore, this new hybrid system ensures that meteorologists have access to a complete set of forecast variables, including those relevant for high-impact weather events.</description>

      <title>Direction Symmetry of Wave Field Modulation by Tidal Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the modulation of unidimensional regular waves over a flat bottom due to a current typically assign an asymmetry between the effects of opposing/following streams on the evolution of major sea variables, such as significant wave height. The significant wave height is expected to monotonically increase with opposing streams and to decrease with following streams. To some extent, observations on data sets containing a few thousand of waves or over a continuous series of about a day confirm this prediction. Here, based on a multi-year dataset, we show that in very broad-banded seas with high directional spread, the asymptotic behavior of sea variables is highly non-trivial and does not follow the theoretical predictions, especially at high values of the ratio between tidal stream and group speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the thermodynamics of the initial formation (genesis) of tornado-like vortices. In particular, it discusses how the thermodynamics of discrete vortices in a two-dimensional (thin three-dimensional boundary) layer drives the creation of ``hairpins,'' their two-dimensional rearrangement, and stretching of vorticity in the vertical direction inside a turbulent boundary layer that leads to a tornado-like flow. Turbulence of that process is analyzed with the help of the vortex filament model and its connection to the fluid flow equations via the Hasimoto and Madelung transforms of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Finally, a formula for the non-equilibrium entropy flux associated with the development of two-dimensional turbulence in the boundary layer is provided.</description>

Abstract: The microseismic motion, ambient ground vibration caused by ocean waves, affects ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In this study, characteristics of the ocean waves including seasonal variations and correlation coefficients were investigated for the significant wave heights at 13 coasts in Japan. The relationship between the ocean waves and the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site was also evaluated. As a result, it almost succeeded in explaining the microseismic motion at the KAGRA site by the principal components of the ocean wave data. One possible application of this study is microseismic forecasting, an example of which is also presented.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum for sea state inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple method, based on an original change of variables, for the fast and accurate calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum that describes the sea echo of High-Frequency radars. A byproduct of the technique is the derivation of an improved weighting function which can be used for the inversion of the main sea state parameters. For this we revisit Barrick's method for the estimation of the significant wave height and the mean period from the ocean Doppler spectrum. On the basis of numerical simulations we show that a better estimation of these parameters can be reached but necessitates a preliminary bias correction that depends only on the radar frequency. A second consequence of our formulation is the derivation of a simple yet analytical nonlinear approximation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum when the Doppler frequency is larger than the Bragg frequency. This opens new perspective for the inversion of directional wave spectra from High-Frequency radar measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning Closed-form Equations for Subgrid-scale Closures from High-fidelity Data: Promises and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in discovering interpretable, closed-form equations for subgrid-scale (SGS) closures/parameterizations of complex processes in Earth systems. Here, we apply a common equation-discovery technique with expansive libraries to learn closures from filtered direct numerical simulations of 2D turbulence and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Across common filters (e.g., Gaussian, box), we robustly discover closures of the same form for momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of gradients of filtered variables, with constants that are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model (NGM), which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series. Indeed, we suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms, for many common systems/physics, discovered closures are consistent with the leading term of the Taylor-series (except when cutoff filters are used). Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy simulations with NGM closures are unstable, despite significant similarities between the true and NGM-predicted fluxes (correlations $&gt; 0.95$). We identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, NGM produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales, lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In RBC, potential energy backscattering is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that SGS fluxes diagnosed from data, presumed the ''truth'' for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures in future work, we propose several ideas around using physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are relevant to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.</description>

      <title>Energy and environmental impacts of air-to-air heat pumps in a mid-latitude city</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a key technology for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates the potential switch to air-to-air HPs (AAHPs) in Toulouse, France, where conventional space heating is split between electric and gas sources. In this context, we find that AAHPs reduce heating energy consumption by 57% to 76%, with electric heating energy consumption decreasing by 6% to 47%, resulting in virtually no local heating-related CO$_{2}$ emissions. We observe a slight reduction in near-surface air temperature of up to 0.5 {\deg}C during cold spells, attributable to a reduction in sensible heat flux, which is unlikely to compromise AAHPs operational efficiency. While Toulouse's heating energy mix facilitates large energy savings, electric energy consumption may increase in cities where gas or other fossil fuel sources prevail. Furthermore, as AAHPs efficiency varies with internal and external conditions, their impact on the electrical grid is more complex than conventional heating systems. The results underscore the importance of matching heating system transitions with sustainable electricity generation to maximize environmental benefits. The study highlights the intricate balance between technological advancements in heating and their broader environmental and policy implications, offering key insights for urban energy policy and sustainability efforts.</description>
