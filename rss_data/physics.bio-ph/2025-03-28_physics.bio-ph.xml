      <title>Heat and Hostility: How Substrate Temperature Shapes Bacterial Deposition Patterns and Pathogenesis in Evaporating Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis Droplets ejected from the host can directly settle on a substrate as fomite. In industrial environments, especially the food processing industries, the components maintained at specific temperatures can act as a substrate, leading to the fomite mode of infection. We hypothesize that substrate temperature influences the desiccation dynamics, bacterial deposition patterns, and bacterial viability and infectivity. Experiments We conducted a novel study on the desiccation behaviour of bacteria-laden droplets on hydrophilic substrates at different temperatures, an area rarely explored. Such studies have been rarely attempted. We analysed bacterial deposition patterns, mass transport dynamics, and viability across various base fluids used in food industry, such as Milli-Q water, LB media, and meat extract. Thermal imaging, confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and optical profilometry characterized pattern formations, while bacterial viability and infectivity were assessed post-desiccation Findings Our results indicate that substrate temperature significantly affects bacterial deposition and viability. With Milli-Q water, lower temperatures resulted in ring-like deposits, while higher temperatures led to thinner rings with inner deposits due to Marangoni convection. Radial velocities at 50{\deg}C were an order of magnitude higher than 25{\deg}C. For LB media, dendritic patterns varied with temperature, whereas meat extract patterns remained unchanged. At 60{\deg}C, bacterial surface area was significantly reduced compared to 25{\deg}C while maintaining a constant aspect ratio. Higher temperatures reduced bacterial viability in precipitates, but bacterial infectivity remained nearly unchanged across all base fluids. These findings highlight potential fomite-based infection risks from heated surfaces, particularly in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations of the bacterial ribosome using a general purpose coarse-grained model MARTINI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribosomes are critical biomolecular nanomachines responsible for protein synthesis in all known organisms. The function and dynamics of ribosomes can be studied using molecular dynamics computer simulations. Although this task remains challenging at atomic level, several studies have reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire ribosome. However, for certain applications, atomistic simulations are impractical due to the limited simulation timescales achievable. In this study, we investigate the applicability of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for simulations of the bacterial ribosome. After testing several simulation setups, we found that the structure of the ribosome and its components are generally well represented compared to the reference experimental structure. Compared with all-atom simulations of the entire ribosome, coarse-grained simulations result in a less flexible and smaller ribosome. We demonstrate how modifications of some parameters of the model can enhance the dynamics of the ribosome to better align with the atomistic model. Our work provides a detailed protocol for coarse-grained simulations of the ribosome and highlights aspects of the model that need improvements.</description>

      <title>Soft matter mechanics of immune cell aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-cells are a crucial subset of white blood cells that play a central role in the immune system. When T-cells bind antigens, it leads to cell activation and the induction of an immune response. If T-cells are activated by antigens in vivo or artificially in vitro, they form multicellular aggregates. The mechanical properties of such clusters provide valuable information on different T-cell activation pathways. Furthermore, the aggregate mechanics capture how T-cells are affected by mechanical forces and interact within larger conglomerates, such as lymph nodes and tumours. However, an understanding of collective T-cell adhesion and mechanics following cell activation is currently lacking. Probing the mechanics of fragile and microscopically small living samples is experimentally challenging. Here, the micropipette force sensor technique was used to stretch T-cell aggregates and directly measure their Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength. A mechanistic model was developed to correlate how the stiffness of the mesoscale multicellular aggregate emerges from the mechanical response of the individual microscopic cells within the cluster. We show how the aggregate elasticity is affected by different activators and relate this to different activation pathways in the cells. Our soft matter mechanics study of multicellular T-cell aggregates contributes to our understanding of the biology behind immune cell activation.</description>

      <title>Probing cellular activity via charge-sensitive quantum nanoprobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>

      <title>In vivo dynamic optical coherence tomography of human skin with hardware- and software-based motion correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo application of dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is hindered by bulk motion of the sample. We demonstrate DOCT imaging of \invivo human skin by adopting a sample-fixation attachment to suppress bulk motion and a subsequent software motion correction to further reduce the effect of sample motion. The performance of the motion-correction method was assessed by DOCT image observation, statistical analysis of the mean DOCT values, and subjective image grading. Both the mean DOCT value analysis and subjective grading showed statistically significant improvement of the DOCT image quality. In addition, a previously unobserved high DOCT layer was identified though image observation, which may represent the stratum basale with high keratinocyte proliferation.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a notoriously complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies as well as the complex and periodically changing shapes of these meso-organisms add extra challenges for accurately modelling their dynamics. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to experimentally study the physics of biological meso-swimming dynamics. We directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia sp. and determine how the propulsive force scales with body size. We show that this scaling law is universal for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms, regardless of body shape, swimming strategy, or the addition of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we determine the time-reversal symmetry breaking of Artemia as it transitions from the viscous regime to the mesoscale. We discover that this model meso-swimmer achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Protein Dynamics: A Review of Computational Methods for Studying Photoactive Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoactive proteins absorb light and undergo structural changes that enable them to perform essential biological functions. These proteins are critical for understanding light-induced biological processes, making them important in biophysics, biotechnology, and medicine. One effective approach to uncovering photoactive processes is through computational methods. These techniques provide atomic-level insights into the structural, electronic, and dynamic changes that occur upon light absorption. By employing these methods, we can gain a better understanding of processes that are challenging to capture experimentally, such as chromophore isomerization and protein conformational changes. Here, we provide a brief overview of the different families of photoactive proteins and the computational methods used to study them, including bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, and enhanced sampling. Our review can serve as an introduction to computational methods for studying light-activated molecular processes, specifically targeting researchers beginning their journey in this field.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and chaos in complex ecological communities with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the wide range of dynamics observed in ecological communities is challenging due to the large number of species involved, the complex network of interactions among them, and the influence of multiple environmental variables. Here, we consider a general framework to model the dynamics of species-rich communities under the effects of external environmental factors, showing that it naturally leads to delayed interactions between species, and analyze the impact of such memory effects on population dynamics. Employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with time delays and random interactions, we characterize the resulting dynamical phases in terms of the statistical properties of community interactions. Our findings reveal that memory effects can generate persistent and synchronized oscillations in species abundances in sufficiently competitive communities. This provides an additional explanation for synchronization in large communities, complementing known mechanisms such as predator-prey cycles and environmental periodic variability. Furthermore, we show that when reciprocal interactions are negatively correlated, time delays alone can induce chaotic behavior. This suggests that ecological complexity is not a prerequisite for unpredictable population dynamics, as intrinsic memory effects are sufficient to generate long-term fluctuations in species abundances. The techniques developed in this work are applicable to any high-dimensional random dynamical system with time delays.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuronal firing and flagellar rotations. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, ensemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the {temporal evolution} of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>
