      <title>Planet formation at the inner edge of the dead zone -- I: the interplay between accretion outbursts and dust growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone (~1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales (~10 kyr for $\alpha$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to ~1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects.</description>

      <title>Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material motion.Due to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed. For these six systems, we measure the system-integrated polarization fraction and angle of linear polarization, providing quantitative constraints on their unresolved circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>A Census Before Rubin of Asteroid Families in the Main Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collisional family is a collection of &gt;km-size asteroid fragments produced by a large scale collision between asteroids. Here we cataloged 335 notable collisional families in the main asteroid belt. When possible, we estimated each family's formation age, mean visible albedo, taxonomic type, and parent body size. We found that older families (t_age&gt;10 Myr) produced by impacts on small parent bodies (diameter D&lt;5 km) are rarely identified because small members of these families have drifted over time by the Yarkovsky effect and blended with the background. The young families (t_age&lt;10 Myr) typically have small parent bodies (D&lt;10 km) as large asteroids do not disrupt often enough. The full catalog, including membership files for 335 individual asteroid families, is available for download (https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~davidn/Proper25).</description>

      <title>Capture and Stability of Resonant Planet Pairs in Turbulent Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the resonance capture and stability of two-planet systems in turbulent disks. By incorporating stochastic forcing (parameterized by $\kappa$) alongside laminar angular momentum and eccentricity damping timescales ($\tau_{\rm m}, \tau_{e}$), we derive an analytical criterion for the general $j:j-1$ mean motion resonances, and validate it through N-body simulations. The outcome is mapped in $\kappa$-$\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$ parameter space, revealing two distinct regimes: resonance trapping and turbulence-induced disruption -- which occurs either directly cross or via temporary capture followed by escape through turbulent diffusion. Crucially, our analysis identifies turbulence as a universal destabilizer. It amplifies the intrinsic overstability mechanism: In laminar disks, escape requires $\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$ to drop below a critical limit due to excessive eccentricity excitation. We demonstrate that turbulent diffusion lowers this limit, demanding stronger damping (larger $\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$) for stability. Thus, greater turbulence promotes escape, and sufficiently strong diffusion precludes resonance retention irrespective of eccentricity damping.</description>

      <title>PLATOSpec's first results: Three new transiting warm Jupiters from the WINE survey TIC 147027702, TIC 245076932 and TIC 87422071</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterisation of three transiting warm Jupiters: TIC 147027702b, TIC 245076932b and TIC 87422071b. These systems were initially identified as transiting candidates using light curves generated from the full-frame images of the TESS mission. We confirmed the planetary nature of these objects with ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations using FEROS and the new PLATOSpec spectrograph attached to the ESO 1.52 m telescope at the La Silla Observatory, and with ground-based photometric observations of the Observatoire Moana, Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope and ASTEP. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that the planet TIC 147027702b has a low-eccentric orbit ($e = 0.13 \pm 0.05$) with a period of 44.4 days and has a mass of $1.09^{+0.07}_{-0.13}$ M$_J$ and a radius of $0.98 \pm 0.06$ R$_J$. TIC 245076932b has a moderately low mass of $0.51 \pm 0.05$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \pm 0.05$ R$_J$, and an eccentric orbit ($e = 0.43 \pm 0.02$) with a period of 21.6 days. TIC 87422071b has a mass of $1.29 \pm 0.10$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \pm 0.08$ R$_J$, and has a slightly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.12 \pm 0.07$) with a period of 11.3 days. These well-characterised warm Jupiters expand the currently limited sample of similar gas giants and provide valuable benchmarks for testing models of giant-planet formation, migration, and tidal evolution.</description>

      <title>Infall onto the Protoplanetary Disk during the Gravitational Collapse of a Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of models for matter infall from a collapsing molecular cloud is an essential part of numerical studies on the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation.</description>

      <title>Photosynthetic exergy I. Thermodynamic limits for habitable-zone planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthesis is central to Earth's biosphere and a prime candidate for sustaining complex life on habitable exoplanets, yet a thermodynamically consistent treatment of the work potential of stellar radiation at planetary surfaces is still lacking. We develop a radiative-thermodynamic framework that quantifies the maximum useful work extractable for a given star-planet configuration and yields exergy-based bounds on photosynthetic power and long-wavelength absorption cutoffs. From these we derive kinetically constrained red limits for high-$\Delta G$ photochemistry and apply them to Earth-like planets receiving the same bolometric flux from FGK and M blackbody hosts, computing thresholded photon supplies and truncated exergy fluxes below a photosystem II red limit. For such planets the constraints confine single-photon oxygenic photosynthesis to near-infrared bands around Solar-type stars and to somewhat bluer wavelengths around late M dwarfs. Integrated over the stellar spectrum, the thresholded photon supply and truncated exergy available to drive a photosystem water-oxidation step are larger by factors $\sim 5$ around FGK hosts than around $T_\star\approx 3000$~K M dwarfs. For the Solar-Earth system, the exergy-based upper bound on O$_2$ production exceeds the observed O$_2$ throughput by several orders of magnitude, consistent with Earth's photosynthetic efficiencies. Cool M dwarfs suffer a double penalty: fewer photons above threshold and a lower shortwave exergy fraction, yielding systematically tighter ceilings on high-$\Delta G$ photosynthesis than around FGK stars. Our framework provides upper limits on photosynthetically harvestable power on habitable-zone planets and enables comparisons of photosynthetic potential across exoplanetary systems, and can be extended to multi-band photosystems.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of natural remanence records in fine-grained particles returned from asteroid Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles collected from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft offer a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic record of the primitive solar system, as any terrestrial magnetic contamination is minimal and can be accounted for. In previous studies, stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AFD) measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) records have been conducted on seven Ryugu particles. However, due to the limited number of samples, there is no consensus regarding the interpretation of the results of these measurements. To address this problem, we performed stepwise AFD measurements of the NRM on 28 Ryugu particles. Twenty-three of the particles exhibited one or two stable NRM components, whereas the remaining five did not. Isothermal remanent magnetization-based paleointensity values derived from stable NRM components varied by more than one order of magnitude. These NRM characteristics were consistent with those observed in previous studies. Therefore, as a reflection of the original nature of the NRM record, some Ryugu particles exhibited stable NRM components, whereas others did not. The Ryugu particles investigated in this study and those from a previous study exhibited spatially inhomogeneous NRM directions within individual particles, constraining the NRM acquisition time to before the final solidification of the current Ryugu particles. A mechanism of remanence acquisition that can explain the observed NRM characteristics is a chemical remanent magnetization associated with the growth of framboidal magnetite during aqueous alteration in Ryugu's parent body.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Sympathetic Flaring in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most flares on the Sun occur at random, but there is a small percentage of "sympathetic flaring" -- the triggering of one flare by another. Previously there had been no widespread confirmation of sympathetic flares on other stars. In this work, we developed a new flare detection algorithm that is sensitive to closely-separated and overlapping stellar flares. We applied it to TESS data and discovered ~ 220,000 flares on ~ 16,000 stars, the majority of which are M-dwarfs. The wait time distribution between flares demonstrates an excess of closely-separated flares, relative to expectations from a Poisson process. We attribute this to sympathetic flares, occurring at a rate of between 4% and 9%, which matches the rate seen on the Sun. Our result is the first statistically robust detection of sympathetic flares on other stars, demonstrating a commonality between the Sun and low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Magma ocean interactions can explain JWST observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270~d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.</description>

      <title>The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1% to 150% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities that reduce local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 17 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</description>

Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope was to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $\eta_{\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical modeling of liposome congregation in meteorite craters of Early Earth</title>

Abstract: This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. In this work, we introduce binary source and lens models into the gravitational lensing formalism encoded in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) python software package. These new binary models in BAGLE account for Keplerian orbits. We also add binary models with fewer parameters that describe the binary orbital motion as acceleration, linear, or stationary motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to uniquely determine physical parameters like mass and distance, unlike photometry-only microlensing which often yield ambiguous solutions. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>
