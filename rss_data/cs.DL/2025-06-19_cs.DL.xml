      <title>Enhancing the prediction of publications' long-term impact using early citations, readerships, and non-scientific factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to improve the accuracy of long-term citation impact prediction by integrating early citation counts, Mendeley readership, and various non-scientific factors, such as journal impact factor, authorship and reference list characteristics, funding and open-access status. Traditional citation-based models often fall short by relying solely on early citations, which may not capture broader indicators of a publication's potential influence. By incorporating non-scientific predictors, this model provides a more nuanced and comprehensive framework that outperforms existing models in predicting long-term impact. Using a dataset of Italian-authored publications from the Web of Science, regression models were developed to evaluate the impact of these predictors over time. Results indicate that early citations and Mendeley readership are significant predictors of long-term impact, with additional contributions from factors like authorship diversity and journal impact factor. The study finds that open-access status and funding have diminishing predictive power over time, suggesting their influence is primarily short-term. This model benefits various stakeholders, including funders and policymakers, by offering timely and more accurate assessments of emerging research. Future research could extend this model by incorporating broader altmetrics and expanding its application to other disciplines and regions. The study concludes that integrating non-citation-based factors with early citations captures a more complex view of scholarly impact, aligning better with real-world research influence.</description>

      <title>Libraries, Digital Libraries, and Data: Forty years, Four Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Digital libraries" is an umbrella term that encompasses the automation of library services, online catalogs, information retrieval systems, multi-media databases, data archives, and other internet-facing collections of digital resources. Clifford Lynch has played pivotal roles in the technical development, institutionalization, policy, practice, and dissemination of digital libraries for more than 40 years. Beginning with his foundational role in building MELVYL for the University of California in the early 1980s -- the first internet-native online open access library catalog -- through his convening roles in open access and open data in the 21st century, his career is marked by multiple milestones of innovation. Clifford Lynch's career has traced the trajectory of digital libraries and knowledge infrastructures. Over the course of these 40 years, research libraries have faced four categories of challenges: invisible infrastructure, content and collections, preservation and access, and institutional boundaries. These challenges have become yet more complex in an era of open access, open data, and evolving regimes of intellectual property and scholarly publishing. As the digital library communities have merged and diverged over this time span, we collectively face challenges for at least the next 40 years to sustain access to current resources while growing the next generations of digital libraries and librarians.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the gender divide: Authorship and acknowledgment in scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of gender bias in scientific publications has been the subject of ongoing debate. One aspect of this debate concerns whether women receive equal credit for their contributions compared to men. Conventional wisdom suggests that women are more likely to be acknowledged than listed as co-authors, a role that carries greater prestige. Here, we analyze data from hundreds of thousands of scientists across nine disciplines and a broad range of publications. Our results confirm persistent gender disparities: women are more frequently acknowledged than credited as co-authors, especially in roles involving investigation and analysis. To account for status and disciplinary effects, we examined collaboration pairs composed of highly cited (high-status) and less cited (low-status) scientists. In such collaborations, the highly cited scientist is more likely to be listed as a co-author, regardless of gender. Notably, highly cited women in these pairs are even more likely to be listed as co-authors than their male counterparts. These findings suggest that power dynamics and perceived success heavily influence how credit is distributed in scientific publishing. The results underscore the role of status in shaping authorship and call for a more nuanced understanding of how gender, power, and recognition interact. This research offers valuable insights for scientists, editors, and funding agencies committed to advancing equity in science.</description>

      <title>PubMed knowledge graph 2.0: Connecting papers, patents, and clinical trials in biomedical science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Papers, patents, and clinical trials are essential scientific resources in biomedicine, crucial for knowledge sharing and dissemination. However, these documents are often stored in disparate databases with varying management standards and data formats, making it challenging to form systematic and fine-grained connections among them. To address this issue, we construct PKG 2.0, a comprehensive knowledge graph dataset encompassing over 36 million papers, 1.3 million patents, and 0.48 million clinical trials in the biomedical field. PKG 2.0 integrates these dispersed resources through 482 million biomedical entity linkages, 19 million citation linkages, and 7 million project linkages. The construction of PKG 2.0 wove together fine-grained biomedical entity extraction, high-performance author name disambiguation, multi-source citation integration, and high-quality project data from the NIH Exporter. Data validation demonstrates that PKG 2.0 excels in key tasks such as author disambiguation and biomedical entity recognition. This dataset provides valuable resources for biomedical researchers, bibliometric scholars, and those engaged in literature mining.</description>
