      <title>peaks: a Python package for analysis of angle-resolved photoemission and related spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic band structure, describing the motion and interactions of electrons in materials, dictates the electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties of solids. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct experimental probe of such electronic band structures, and so is widely employed in the study of functional, quantum, and 2D materials. \texttt{peaks} (\textbf{P}ython \textbf{E}lectron spectroscopy \textbf{A}nalysis by \textbf{K}ing group @ \textbf{S}t Andrews) provides a Python package for advanced data analysis of ARPES and related spectroscopic data. It facilitates the fast visualisation and analysis of multi-dimensional datasets, allows for the complex data hierarchy typical to ARPES experiments, and supports lazy data loading and parallel processing, reflecting the ever-increasing data volumes used in ARPES. It is designed to be run in an interactive notebook environment, with extensive inline and pop-out GUI support for data visualisation.</description>

      <title>Engineering Phonons in Compositionally Complex Carbide Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced ceramic materials with exceptional irradiation-resistance and high-temperature tolerance for nuclear applications, compositionally complex carbides (CCCs) have emerged as a highly promising class of candidate materials for extreme environments. In such conditions, critical material properties such as thermal stability, elasticity, thermal conductivity and thermodynamics behavior are predominantly influenced by phonons. In CCCs, pronounced cation disorder can lead to significant phonon scattering due to inherent mass and force constant variations, impacting these critical properties. In this study, we used ab initio calculations to predict the phonon band structures and systematically explore the influence of mass and force constant variance on the phonon spectral function of CCCs with a rock salt structure, ranging from binary to five-metal component carbides. Our findings reveal that the selection and concentration of constituent elements can be strategically utilized to tune the phonon band structure, phonon bandgap and phonon scattering in CCCs, thereby enabling control over phonon-related properties. Additionally, we measured the thermal conductivity of some of these CCCs using the spatial-domain thermoreflectance technique. Interestingly, the measured thermal conductivity of some of these CCCs indicates that five-component ceramics exhibit higher thermal conductivity than certain ternary and binary alloys. This observation contrasts with the expectation that greater cation disorder would result in more scattering and lower thermal conductivity. This intriguing result opens up the possibility of discovering CCCs with better thermal conductivity, presenting new opportunities for their application in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\'eel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Insights into Composition Property Relationships in FCC High Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure, and property data presents significant challenges for predictive property modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods capable of learning from limited and heterogeneous datasets. This work presents several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi objective hyperparameter optimization, are evaluated for mapping alloy composition to six mechanical properties. The models achieve competitive or superior performance to conventional regressors across all properties, particularly for yield strength and the UTS/YS ratio, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing complex composition property relationships.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Ab-Initio Based Tight-Binding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic structure of solids can routinely be calculated by standard methods like density functional theory. However, in complicated situations like interfaces, grain boundaries or contact geometries one needs to resort to more simplified models of the electronic structure. Tight-binding models are using a reduced set of orbitals and aim to approximate the electronic structure by short range hopping processes. For example, maximally localized Wannier functions are often used for that purpose. However, their accuracy is limited by the need to disentangle the electronic bands. Here, we develop and investigate a different procedure to obtain tight-binding models inspired by machine-learning techniques. The model parameters are optimized in such a way as to reproduce ab-initio band structure data as accurately as possible using an as small as possible number of model parameters. The procedure is shown to result in models with smaller ranges and fewer orbitals than maximally localized Wannier functions but same or even better accuracy. We argue that such a procedure is more useful for automated construction of tight-binding models particularly for large-scale materials calculations.</description>

      <title>SERS Raman detection of the CO$_2$ Moisture Swing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of scalable, energy-efficient carbon dioxide capture technologies is critical for achieving net-zero emissions. Moisture swing sorbents offer a promising alternative to traditional thermal regeneration methods by enabling reversible CO$_2$ binding through humidity-driven ion hydrolysis. In this study, we investigate the anion speciation dynamics in two classes of MS materials, an anion-exchange resin with bicarbonate anion and activated carbon impregnated with potassium bicarbonate salt using both sorption measurements and in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Ni coated Ag nanowires were employed as SERS substrates to enhance signal intensity and enable the real-time detection of carbonate , bicarbonate , and hydroxide species under controlled humidity conditions in both air and nitrogen atmospheres. The results reveal humidity-dependent interconversion between anionic species, with significant spectral shifts confirming the reversible hydrolysis reactions that drive the MS mechanism. Under humid conditions, we observed the depletion of bicarbonate signals and a concurrent increase in carbonate species, consistent with moisture-induced desorption of CO$_2$. These findings not only validate the mechanistic models of humidity-driven anion exchange in moisture swing sorbents but also demonstrate the practical potential of SERS as an operando diagnostic tool for monitoring CO$_2$ capture media. The ability to resolve and quantify the reversible transformation of carbonate, bicarbonate, and hydroxide ions under realistic environmental conditions provides valuable insight for the rational design, performance optimization, and quality control of next-generation sorbent materials for direct air capture applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Layer-Dependent Surface Energy and Exfoliation Energy of van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking and twisting 2D van der Waals (vdW) layers have become versatile platforms to tune electron correlation. These platforms rely on exfoliating vdW materials down to a single and few vdW layers. We calculate the intrinsic layer-dependent surface and exfoliation energies of typical vdW materials such as, graphite, h-BN, black P, MX$_2$ (M=Mo and W, X=S, Se and Te), MX (M=Ga and In, X=S, Se and Te), Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ using density functional theory. For exchange-correlation functionals with explicit vdW interaction, a single vdW layer always has the smallest surface energy, giving a surface energy reduction when compared to thicker vdW layers. However, the magnitude of this surface energy reduction quickly decreases with increasing number of atomic layers inside the single vdW layer for different vdW materials. Such atomic-layer-dependence in surface energy reduction helps explain the different effectiveness of exfoliation for different vdW materials down to a single vdW layer.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Anisotropy in Two-dimensional van der Waals Magnetic Materials and Their Heterostructures: Importance, Mechanisms, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) monolayers and heterostructures has attracted significant attention due to its promising potential for next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies. A key factor in stabilizing long-range magnetic order in these systems is magnetic anisotropy, which plays a crucial role in overcoming the limitations imposed by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This review provides a comprehensive theoretical and experimental overview of the importance of magnetic anisotropy in enabling intrinsic 2D magnetism and shaping the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of 2D vdW materials. We begin by summarizing the fundamental mechanisms that determine magnetic anisotropy, emphasizing the contributions from strong ligand spin-orbit coupling of ligand atoms and unquenched orbital magnetic moments. We then examine a range of material engineering approaches, including alloying, doping, electrostatic gating, strain, and pressure, that have been employed to effectively tune magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Finally, we discuss open challenges and promising future directions in this rapidly advancing field. By presenting a broad perspective on the role of magnetic anisotropy in 2D magnetism, this review aims to stimulate ongoing efforts and new ideas toward the realization of robust, room-temperature applications based on 2D vdW magnetic materials and their heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Alpha-, Beta-, and Gamma-TODD-G: Novel 2D Planar Carbon Allotropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of three novel two-dimensional carbon allotropes: alpha-, beta-, and gamma-TODD-Graphene (TODD-G), composed of 3-8-12-16, 3-8-12-16, and 3-4-8-12 interconnected carbon rings with sp/sp2 hybridization, respectively. Structural optimization, phonon spectra, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their thermal and dynamical stability. All phases exhibit metallic electronic behavior, with distinct Dirac-like features and tilted Dirac cones that suggest anisotropic charge transport. Mechanical analysis reveals tunable anisotropy: alpha-TODD-G is strongly anisotropic, beta-TODD-G shows moderate anisotropy, and gamma-TODD-G displays an almost isotropic mechanical response. Optical spectra further differentiate the phases, with gamma-TODD-G showing strong absorption in the infrared region, while alpha- and beta-TODD-G mainly absorb in the visible and ultraviolet ranges.</description>

      <title>Rotational-Mode-Enhanced Piezoelectricity in a Ferroelectric Double Helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a ``dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses[\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.046802}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic consequences remain largely unexplored. Here, using first-principles calculations on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.This unique structure, conceptualized as a ``self-Moir\'e" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</description>

      <title>Many-body perturbation theory vs. density functional theory: A systematic benchmark for band gaps of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark many-body perturbation theory against density functional theory (DFT) for the band gaps of solids. We systematically compare four $GW$ variants $-$ $G_{0}W_{0}$ using the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole approximation ($G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA), full-frequency quasiparticle $G_{0}W_{0}$ (QP$G_{0}W_{0}$), full-frequency quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QS$GW$), and QS$GW$ augmented with vertex corrections in $W$ (QS$G\hat{W}$) $-$ against the currently best performing and popular density functionals mBJ and HSE06. Our results show that $G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA calculations offer only a marginal accuracy gain over the best DFT methods, however at a higher cost. Replacing the PPA with a full-frequency integration of the dielectric screening improves the predictions dramatically, almost matching the accuracy of the QS$G\hat{W}$. The QS$GW$ removes starting-point bias, but systematically overestimates experimental gaps by about $15\%$. Adding vertex corrections to the screened Coulomb interaction, i.e., performing a QS$G\hat{W}$ calculation, eliminates the overestimation, producing band gaps that are so accurate that they even reliably flag questionable experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spin-to-charge conversion in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/NdNiO$_3$ bilayers at the nickelate metal-insulator phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transition materials such as NdNiO3 (NNO) when coupled with low damping ferromagnets such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) can lead to new multi-functional material systems harnessing the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Stranski-Krastanov Growth of Disordered ScNx Thin Films on MgO(100): Influence of Defect Densities on Electronic Structure and Transport Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a nascent real time Stranski-Krastanov growth of reactively sputtered ScNx thin films on MgO(100). The epitaxial growth was limited to 5 nm at a substrate temperature (Ts) of 25 C while the self-sustaining epitaxial nature along the [100] azimuth was retained up to 25 nm in Ts = 250 and 500 C samples due to enhanced adatom mobility. At Ts = 700 C, the film showed half order in-situ RHEED pattern, with forbidden (hkl) planes indicating N deficient hcp Sc-N phase. Presence of defect densities i.e., N vacancies and O interstitials leads to a disorder in ScNx system with weak localization effect and appearance of Raman relaxed first order transverse and longitudinal optical phonon modes and further leads to metal like Seebeck coefficient. Higher grain boundaries at Ts = 25 C and higher N out-diffusion at Ts = 700 C paves way for incorporation of higher oxygen interstitial in these samples.</description>

      <title>Hole-doping reduces the coercive field in ferroelectric hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric hafnia holds promise for next-generation memory and logic applications because of its CMOS compatibility. However, the high coercive field required for polarization switching in hafnia remains a critical challenge for efficient device operations. Using first-principles calculations and phenomenological modeling, we predict that hole doping can reduce the coercive field from 8 MV/cm in undoped hafnia to 6 MV/cm in hafnia doped with 0.2 holes per formula unit (f.u.). In the absence of doping, the reversal of polarization of the Pca21 phase is preferred through the non-polar, tetragonal P42/nmc phase. This switching pathway involves the coupling of three hard distortion modes that render undoped hafnia as an improper ferroelectric. The overall energy barrier through this pathway remains unchanged (80 meV/f.u.) upon hole doping. However, the introduction of holes hardens the polar distortion mode that connects the polar Pca21 phase to the non-polar, orthorhombic Pbcm phase, and reduces the energy barrier from 180 meV/f.u. in undoped hafnia to 80 meV/f.u. at 0.2 holes/f.u.. Overall, hole doping makes the latter switching pathway through the Pbcm phase competitive, and renders hafnia as a proper ferroelectric with a lower coercive field.</description>

      <title>Single-shot optical precessional magnetization switching of Pt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast magnetization switching triggered by a single femtosecond laser pulse has gained significant attention over the last decade for its potential in low-power consumption, high-speed memory applications. However, this phenomenon has been primarily observed in Gd-based ferrimagnetic materials, which are unsuitable for storage due to their weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). In this work, we demonstrated that applying a single laser pulse and an in-plane magnetic field can facilitate magnetic switching in a Pt/Co/Pt ferromagnetic trilayers stack within a specific laser power window. To further understand this phenomenon, we introduce a Cu layer to accelerates the re-establishment time of the anisotropy field of Pt/Co/Pt trilayers, which leads to bullseye-patterned magnetic switching. We have mapped state diagrams for these phenomena, and through micromagnetic simulations, we have determined that these switchings are influenced by thermal anisotropy torque, which can be modulated through PMA. These findings indicate that single-shot optical precessional magnetization reversal is feasible in a broader range of materials, opening avenues for the development of optical-magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Ta2Pd3Te8: A potential candidate of 1D van der Waals stacked thermoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new thermoelectric (TE) materials is an eternal goal in the TE field. Excellent TE materials have ranged from 3D stacked to 2D stacked bulk. However, the 1D stacked receives little attention due to the scarcity in quantity. In this work, it is predicted that 1D van der Waals (vdW) stacked Ta2Pd3Te8 crystal is a compelling candidate for TE applications by combining first-principles calculations with phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equations and molecular dynamics methods. We find that Ta2Pd3Te8 crystal has mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stabilities, and its TE properties are featured by strong anisotropy, high power factor (PF) and low lattice thermal conductivity. The results indicate the ZT values of n-type Ta2Pd3Te8 at 900 K along a, b and c axes reach 0.48, 0.39 and 0.22, respectively. We propose that enlarging the bandgap can weaken the bipolar effect and thus significantly increases ZT to 1.11. The findings in the work not only stimulate more theoretical works on 1D vdW stacked TE materials, but also provide valuable information for experimentally improving TE materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Lithium-Ion Transport Mechanism in Li2ZrCl6 Solid-State Electrolyte via Deep Learning-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which is central to their electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. Detailed analysis shows substantial differences in lithium-ion dynamics: {\alpha}-LZC phases display pronounced collective diffusion driven anisotropic interlayer transport, whereas lithium mobility in \b{eta}-LZC is largely determined by isotropic translations and individual diffusion dominated by intralayer migration. Across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. Local structure organizations analysis confirms that particular zirconium arrangements in LZC phases create varied ion channel energy barriers, influencing dynamic behaviors: In {\alpha}-LZC phases, the interlayer hopping barrier is lower than the intralayer barrier, facilitating faster ion transport. Disordered {\alpha}-LZC, with its loose zirconium arrangement, presents the lowest energy barrier, enhancing conductivity. Conversely, \b{eta}-LZC features a higher overall barrier, with intralayer hopping favored over interlayer, resulting in slower ion migration.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced decomposition of Bi14WO24</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the high-pressure behaviour Bi14WO24, a high oxide ion conductor member of the Bi2O3-WO3 binary system. The tetragonal polymorph of Bi14WO24 was studied under high-pressure conditions using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. It was found that in contrast to isostructural Bi14CrO24 and Bi14MoO24 which experience a phase transition around 5 GPa, in our study Bi14WO24 undergoes an irreversible chemical decomposition into Bi2O3 and WO3 at 2.85(5) GPa. The pressure dependence of the unit-cell parameters of Bi14WO24 was also determined, and hence the linear compressibility along different axes and room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state were derived. Bulk modulus of tetragonal Bi14WO24 was found to be 49.8(2.6) GPa, and the linear compressibility of the two crystallographic axes, \k{appa}a and \k{appa}c were 6.94(2) 10-3 GPa-1 and = 3.73(1) 10-3 GPa-1, respectively. The pressure induced decomposition can be attributed to the favourable increasing density of the system to accommodate the pressure induced stress.</description>

      <title>Impact of Au Ion Implantation on 2D $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ for Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 2D magnetic materials highlight their potential in semiconductors, magnetism, and spintronics, particularly in tuning magnetic properties for spintronic applications. This study investigates the impact of low-energy (30 KeV) Au ion implantation on 2D layered exfoliated $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ flakes prepared on Si/SiO$_2$ substrates using the Scotch tape method. Five different ion doses (5$\times10^{13}$, 1$\times10^{14}$, 5$\times10^{14}$, 1$\times10^{15}$, and 2.5$\times10^{15}$ ions/cm$^2$) were used to modify the morphology, composition, structural, and vibrational properties of the samples. The implantation introduces significant changes in morphology and magnetic behavior, leading to an increase in Curie temperature and an attribution from superexchange to double exchange interactions. The reduced exchange energy gaps and modified magnetic moments attribute to Au ions intercalation in $Cr_2Ge_2Te_6$ underscore the potential of ions implantation to tune the magnetic properties of 2D materials for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the moir\'e material library continues to unlock novel quantum phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into the moir\'e family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moir\'e superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at 2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with distinct Chern numbers originating from moir\'e-modulated and conventional integer quantum Hall states. The moir\'e Hofstadter spectrum displays an unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing spin-orbit-enhanced moir\'e phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport in two-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using statistical thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.</description>

      <title>Stacking-induced type-II quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin Chern number in unconventional magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced stress-flow misalignment in soft glassy materials revealed using multi-directional shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the mechanical response of soft glassy materials, such as emulsions, foams, and colloidal suspensions, is key for many industrial processes. While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multi-axis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress-flow misalignment. Our findings offer a new route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.</description>

      <title>The Anisotropic Interface Continuum Solvation Model and the Finite-Element Anisotropic Poisson Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an anisotropic interfacial continuum solvation (AICS) model to simulate the distinct in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants of liquids near solid-liquid interfaces and their spatial variations along the surface normal direction. In low-electron-density regions, each dielectric function in the diagonal components of a dielectric tensor varies monotonically with distance from the solid surface along the surface normal; in high-electron-density regions near the surface, each dielectric function adopts the electron-density-based formulation proposed by Andreussi et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012)) The resulting dielectric tensor is continuously differentiable with respect to both electron density and spatial coordinates. We derived analytical expressions for electrostatic contributions to the KS potential and forces, and implemented AICS, including these analytical derivatives, into CP2K. To solve the anisotropic Poisson equations, we developed a parallel finite-element anisotropic Poisson solver (FEAPS) based on the FEniCSx platform and its interface with CP2K. Analytical forces were validated against finite-difference calculations, while electrostatic potentials computed under vacuum and isotropic solvent conditions using AICS and FEAPS were benchmarked against standard vacuum DFT and SCCS results, respectively. In the anisotropic solvent environment characterized by the enhanced in-plane and reduced out-of-plane dielectric functions near the Ag(111) surface, we calculated the resulting work functions and electrostatic potentials, and optimized the adsorption geometry for OH. Compared to the isotropic case, we observed more pronounced work function shifts and spatially modulated electrostatic profiles across different charge states. Our results also showed that OH tilted more towards the plane parallel to the surface under the anisotropic dielectric conditions.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\vartheta -$functions for the identification of topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact analytical expression is derived for Bloch states in three dimensions, based on the only assumption that the electronic wavefunction can be expanded in terms of Gaussian type orbitals.
  The resulting expression features multidimensional $\vartheta -$functions (and their derivatives) on which the action of discrete space group symmetries is evaluated analytically and contrasted against the symmetry transformations proper of modular forms.
  We integrate group theoretical arguments with continuity requirements of the Bloch states to produce a viable algorithm for the determination of band inversions in materials with a non-trivial topological electronic band structure; the proposed methodology is then applied to two simplified materials models.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate</title>

Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the N\'eel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.</description>

      <title>Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Interaction energies in paranematic colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of colloidal particles embedded in a paranematic -- an isotropic phase of a nematogenic medium above the temperature of the nematic-to-isotropic transition. In this state, the nematic order is induced by the boundary conditions in a narrow band around each particle and it decays exponentially in the bulk.
  We develop rigorous asymptotics of the linearization of the appropriate variational model that allow us to describe weak far-field interactions between the colloidal particles in two dimensional paranematic suspensions. We demonstrate analytically that decay rates of solutions to the full nonlinear and linear problems are similar and verify numerically that the interactions between the particles in these problems have similar dependence on the distance between the particles. Finally, we perform Monte-Carlo simulations for a system of colloidal particles in a paranematic and describe the statistical properties of this system.</description>

      <title>MOFClassifier: A Machine Learning Approach for Validating Computation-Ready Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily relies on high-quality, computation-ready structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen-Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a crystal-likeness score (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves a ROC value of 0.979 (previous best 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the prepara-tion workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.</description>
