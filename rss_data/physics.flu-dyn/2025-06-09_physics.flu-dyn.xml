      <title>Structure functions and flatness of streamwise velocity in a turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a multiscale characterization of the streamwise velocity of a turbulent channel flow. We study the 2nd and 4th order structure functions and the flatness for scales ranging from the dissipative to the integral domains and for a wide range of distances to the walls spanning four distinct regions of the channel. We characterize the impact of the shear stress induced by the walls on these statistics. Far from the walls, in the outer layer, the impact of the boundaries on the flow is negligible and the flow statistics follow the Kolmogorov-Obukhov theory. In the viscous, buffer and logarithmic regions, the inertial domain can be split in two subdomains of scales with two different statistical behaviors. In the logarithmic region, the scaling of the structure functions agrees with the model of Davidson et al. 2006 but the scaling of the flatness seems to better correspond to the characterization of intermittency proposed by Kolmogorov and Obukhov in 1962. The structure functions and flatness of the streamwise velocity in the buffer and viscous regions are studied for the first time. We show the strong non-Gaussianity of the velocity flow at any scale in the viscous layer with strong intermittent events that may correspond to high shear-induced dissipation.</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their computational treatment.</description>

      <title>Flow-induced vibration of twin-pipe model with varying mass and damping: A study using virtual physical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow-induced vibration (FIV) commonly occurs in rigidly coupled twin-pipe structures. However, the limited understanding of their FIV responses and hydrodynamic features presents a major challenge to the development of reliable engineering designs. To bridge this gap, the present study systematically investigates the FIV characteristics of a rigidly coupled twin-pipe model with elastic support using a virtual physical framework (VPF), which enables flexible control of structural parameters during physical testing. A distinctive feature of twin-pipe structures is the presence of in-line hydrodynamic interactions and torsional moments arising from the rigid coupling. The in-line interaction is primarily compressive and becomes more pronounced as the mass ratio increases. The torsional moment coefficient exhibits a rise-fall trend with increasing reduced velocity $U_R$ and stabilizes around 0.46 at low mass ratios. In addition, an "amplitude drop" phenomenon is observed at $U_R=6$, attributed to energy dissipation from the downstream pipe. The mass ratio significantly affects FIV amplitude, frequency, and hydrodynamic coefficients. As the mass ratio decreases, the synchronization region broadens and the hydrodynamic coefficients become more stable. At mass ratio of 1.0, a "resonance forever" behavior is observed. Damping primarily suppresses FIV amplitude, with minimal impact on dominant frequency and hydrodynamic coefficients. These findings provide valuable insights into twin-pipe FIV mechanisms and support a scientific basis for future structural design optimization.</description>

      <title>A Chimera method for high-fidelity simulation of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a block-structured solver for high-fidelity simulation of flows in complex geometries, based on overlapping (Chimera) meshes. The key components of the algorithm are a baseline dissipation-free central discretization and selective high-order filtering, which ensure uniform accuracy and minimal numerical diffusion. These favorable properties are preserved through efficient interpolation across overlapping blocks. Numerical tests demonstrate that the method guarantees a uniform order of accuracy even for distorted, overlapping meshes. Tests conducted for turbulent flow in a pipe show no significant issues at the interfaces or overlapping blocks, highlighting the method's potential for direct numerical simulation (DNS). Finally, we show that the method performs satisfactorily for geometrically complex problems, such as flow past a ship propeller, where it accurately replicates experimental data.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of percolation when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study On Flashing-Induced Instabilities In An Open Natural Circulation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural circulation system (NCS) uses gravity pressure drop caused by density differences in the loop to generate the driving force without any external mechanical devices, which has been widely applied to the design of the nuclear reactor system and the passive safety system due to its simple structure, high intrinsic safety, and strong heat discharge capacity. However, the low-pressure condition can lead to a two-phase flow and make the flow characteristics in the NCS more complex. Flashing-induced instability occurring in the open NCS will cause the system structural vibration as well as mechanical damage and bring safety problems. The study on flashing-flow behaviors in an open NPS has been conducted experimentally in this paper. High-speed camera, thermal needle probe and wire-mesh sensor were adopted to record the flow pattern and measure the void fraction in the polycarbonate visualization riser section. In the start-up process, with the inlet temperature in the riser section increasing, the open NCS has experienced single-phase stable flow, intermittent oscillation between single-phase and two-phase, high subcooling two-phase stable flow, flashing-induced instabilities flow, and low subcooling two-phase stable flow. The flow pattern evolution of flow flashing goes through bubble flow, cap-slug flow, churn flow and wispy annular flow, in which the length of churn can account for more than 40% length of the two-phase regime. The flash number Nflash is used to divide the region of flashing-induced instabilities. It is found that the open NCS is in a stable two-phase flow when the flash number at the outlet of the riser section N_{flash,out} = 4\sim 5.</description>

      <title>Geometric and Physical Constraints Synergistically Enhance Neural PDE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks, architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick. Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict real-world ocean currents.</description>

      <title>Spectral effects of radiating gases on the ignition in a multiswirl staged model combustor using full-spectrum k distribution method -- A Large Eddy Simulation Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer has been proven to be important during the ignition process in gas turbine. Those radiating gases (CO2, H2O, CO) generated during combustion may display strong spectral, or nongray behavior, which is difficult to both characterize and calculate. In this work, both the full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) and weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (WSGG) method, along with the Dynamic-thickened-flame (DTF) and Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) methods, are used to analyze how spectral behavior affects the ignition process in an experimental gas turbine. Results show that radiation affects the ignition process by heating the relatively low temperature regions. Consequently, each ignition phase is differently affected by different spectral treatments. During the initial kernel phase, spectral properties have minimal influence on flame structures and the ignition delay time due to the negligible radiation and optically-thin scenario. However, during the flame growth phase, significant differences appear in the flame structure and the flame propagation speed among different spectral treatments. After the flame fill the combustor and during the stable combustion phase, differences in flame structures calculated by different models become less, but radiation still play an important role in combustion. Therefore, high-fidelity spectral models are recommended during the modelling of the ignition process in the gas turbine.</description>

      <title>Model-based time super-sampling of turbulent flow field sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for model-based time super-sampling of turbulent flow fields. The key enabler is the identification of an empirical Galerkin model from the projection of the Navier-Stokes equations on a data-tailored basis. The basis is obtained from a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the measured fields. Time super-sampling is thus achieved by a time-marching integration of the identified dynamical system, taking the original snapshots as initial conditions. Temporal continuity of the reconstructed velocity fields is achieved through a forward-backwards integration between consecutive measured Particle Image Velocimetry measurements of a turbulent jet flow. The results are compared with the interpolation of the POD temporal coefficients and the low-order reconstruction of data measured at a higher sampling rate. In both cases, the results obtained show the ability of the method to reconstruct the dynamics of the flow with small errors during several flow characteristic times.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-based simulation of turbulent flows over periodic hills using a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating massively separated turbulent flows over bodies is one of the major applications for large-eddy simulation (LES). In the current work, we propose a machine-learning-based LES framework for the rapid simulation of turbulent flows over periodic hills using a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator (HUFNO) framework. The newly proposed HUFNO model integrates the strengths of both the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Fourier neural operator (FNO) in a way that the FNO is applied in the periodic directions of the flow field while the non-periodicity is handled by the CNN-based U-Net framework. In the \emph{a posteriori} tests, compared to the original FNO and the U-Net framework, the HUFNO model shows a higher accuracy in the predictions of the velocity field and Reynolds stresses. Further numerical experiments in the LES show that the HUFNO framework outperforms the traditional Smagorinsky (SMAG) model and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of the turbulence statistics, the energy spectrum, the invariant characteristics of velocity gradients, the wall stresses and the flow separation structures, with much lower computational cost. Importantly, the accuracy and efficiency are transferable to unseen initial conditions and hill shapes, underscoring its great potentials for the fast prediction of strongly separated turbulent flows over curved boundaries.</description>

      <title>Newtonian-like behavior of starting vortex flow in superfluid helium at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study experimentally the starting vortices shed by airfoils accelerating uniformly from rest in superfluid helium-4 (He II). The vortices behave apparently as if they were moving in a classical Newtonian fluid, such as air or water. Specifically, the starting vortex positions obtained from the experimental data are found to be very close to those computed numerically in a Newtonian fluid, at sufficiently small times, when self-similar behavior is expected to occur, and for Reynolds numbers ranging approximately between $5 \times 10^2$ and $5 \times 10^5$. The result indicates neatly that turbulent flows of He II can be very similar to classical flows of Newtonian fluids, when thermal effects can be neglected and at sufficiently large flow scales, i.e. the study demonstrates that superfluid helium-4 could also be employed to study classical Newtonian flows.</description>
