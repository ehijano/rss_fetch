      <title>(Non-Monotonic) Effects of Productivity and Credit Constraints on Equilibrium Aggregate Production in General Equilibrium Models with Heterogeneous Producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a market economy, the aggregate production level depends not only on the aggregate variables but also on the distribution of individual characteristics (e.g., productivity, credit limit, ...). We point out that, due to financial frictions, the equilibrium aggregate production may be non-monotonic in both individual productivity and credit limit. We provide conditions under which this phenomenon happens. By consequence, improving productivity or relaxing credit limit of firms may not necessarily be beneficial to economic development.</description>

      <title>FinSphere: A Conversational Stock Analysis Agent Equipped with Quantitative Tools based on Real-Time Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current financial Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with two critical limitations: a lack of depth in stock analysis, which impedes their ability to generate professional-grade insights, and the absence of objective evaluation metrics to assess the quality of stock analysis reports. To address these challenges, this paper introduces FinSphere, a conversational stock analysis agent, along with three major contributions: (1) Stocksis, a dataset curated by industry experts to enhance LLMs' stock analysis capabilities, (2) AnalyScore, a systematic evaluation framework for assessing stock analysis quality, and (3) FinSphere, an AI agent that can generate high-quality stock analysis reports in response to user queries. Experiments demonstrate that FinSphere achieves superior performance compared to both general and domain-specific LLMs, as well as existing agent-based systems, even when they are enhanced with real-time data access and few-shot guidance. The integrated framework, which combines real-time data feeds, quantitative tools, and an instruction-tuned LLM, yields substantial improvements in both analytical quality and practical applicability for real-world stock analysis.</description>

      <title>Marketron games: Self-propelling stocks vs dumb money and metastable dynamics of the Good, Bad and Ugly markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of price formation in an inelastic market whose dynamics are partially driven by both money flows and their impact on asset prices. The money flow to the market is viewed as an investment policy of outside investors. For the price impact effect, we use an impact function that incorporates the phenomena of market inelasticity and saturation from new money (the $dumb \; money$ effect). Due to the dependence of market investors' flows on market performance, the model implies a feedback mechanism that gives rise to nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, the market price dynamics are seen as a nonlinear diffusion of a particle (the $marketron$) in a two-dimensional space formed by the log-price $x$ and a memory variable $y$. The latter stores information about past money flows, so that the dynamics are non-Markovian in the log price $x$ alone, but Markovian in the pair $(x,y)$, bearing a strong resemblance to spiking neuron models in neuroscience. In addition to market flows, the model dynamics are partially driven by return predictors, modeled as unobservable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. By using a new interpretation of predictive signals as $self$-$propulsion$ components of the price dynamics, we treat the marketron as an active particle, amenable to methods developed in the physics of active matter. We show that, depending on the choice of parameters, our model can produce a rich variety of interesting dynamic scenarios. In particular, it predicts three distinct regimes of the market, which we call the $Good$, the $Bad$, and the $Ugly$ markets. The latter regime describes a scenario of a total market collapse or, alternatively, a corporate default event, depending on whether our model is applied to the whole market or an individual stock.</description>

      <title>Stochastic arbitrage with market index options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opportunities for stochastic arbitrage in an options market arise when it is possible to construct a portfolio of options which provides a positive option premium and which, when combined with a direct investment in the underlying asset, generates a payoff which stochastically dominates the payoff from the direct investment in the underlying asset. We provide linear and mixed-integer linear programs for computing the stochastic arbitrage opportunity providing the maximum option premium to an investor. We apply our programs to 18 years of data on monthly put and call options on the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index, finding no evidence that stochastic arbitrage opportunities are systematically present. A skewed specification of the underlying market return distribution with a constant market risk premium and constant multiplicative variance risk premium is broadly consistent with the pricing of market index options at moderate strikes.</description>
