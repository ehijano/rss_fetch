      <title>Four-dimensional operator systems without the lifting property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide a family of explicit examples of $4$-dimensional operator systems contained in the Calkin algebra $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$ on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for which the identity map has no unital completely positive (ucp) lift to $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ with respect to the canonical quotient map $\pi:\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}) \to \mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$. More specifically, to each unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ generated by $n$ unitaries and unital $*$-homomorphism $\rho:\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})$ with no ucp lift, we construct a four-dimensional operator subsystem $\mathcal{S}$ of $M_{n+1}(\mathcal{A})$ without the lifting property. As a result, for each $n \geq 2$ we exhibit a four-dimensional operator system $\mathcal{S}$ in $M_{n+1}(C_r^*(\mathbb{F}_n))$ without the lifting property. We also obtain explicit examples where the generalized Smith-Ward problem for liftings of joint matrix ranges for three self-adjoint operators has a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Homotopy lifting, asymptotic homomorphisms, and traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following homotopy lifting theorem is proved: Let $\phi, \psi: B \to D/I$ be homotopic $\ast$-homomorphisms and suppose $\psi$ lifts to a (discrete) asymptotic homomorphism. Then $\phi$ lifts to a (discrete) asymptotic homomorphism. Moreover the whole homotopy lifts. We also prove a cp version of this theorem and a version where $\phi$ is replaced by an asymptotic homomorphism. We obtain a lifting characterization of several important properties of C*-algebras and use them together with the lifting theorem to get the following applications:
  1) MF-property is homotopy invariant;
  2) If either $A$ or $B$ is exact, $A$ is homotopy dominated by $B$ and all amenable traces on $B$ are quasidiagonal, then all amenable traces on $A$ are quasidiagonal;
  3) If a C*-algebra $A$ is homotopy dominated by a nuclear C*-algebra $B$ and all (hyperlinear) traces on $B$ are MF, then all hyperlinear traces on $A$ are MF.
  4) Some of the extension groups introduced by Manuilov and Thomsen coincide.</description>

      <title>The standard construction for cocycle twisted and braided tensor product W$^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ and a (generalized) dual unitary $2$-cocycle $\hat{\Omega}$, any W$^*$-algebra $A$ with a $\mathbb{G}$-action can be twisted into a new W$^*$-algebra $A_{\hat{\Omega}}$ with an action by the cocycle twist $\mathbb{G}_{\hat{\Omega}}$ of $\mathbb{G}$. We show how, in general, the standard space $L^2(A_{\hat{\Omega}})$, with its standard $\mathbb{G}_{\hat{\Omega}}$-representation, can be seen as a twist of $L^2(A)$ with its standard $\mathbb{G}$-representation. We then apply this general result in the special case of (generalized) Drinfeld doubles.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of generalized spin--boson models with critical ultraviolet divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous construction of generalized spin--boson models with commuting transition matrices and form factors exhibiting critical ultraviolet (UV) divergences. That is, we cover all divergences where a self-energy renormalization, but no non-Fock representation, is required. Our method is based on a direct definition of the renormalized Hamiltonian on a sufficiently large test domain, followed by a Friedrichs extension. We then prove that this Hamiltonian coincides with the one obtained by cut-off renormalization. Furthermore, we show that for specific supercritical cases, i.e., when a non-Fock representation is required, the renormalized Hamiltonian is trivial.</description>

      <title>Voiculescu's Theorem in Properly Infinite Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Voiculescu's theorem on approximate unitary equivalence in separable properly infinite factors. As applications, we establish the norm-denseness of the set of all reducible operators, prove a generalized Voiculescu's bicommutant theorem and a version of asymptotic bicommutant theorem, and obtain an interesting cohomological result. Additionally, we extend these results to multiplier algebras within separable type $\mathrm{III}$ factors. At last, a concept of the nuclear length is introduced.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative integral on spectrally truncated spectral triples, and a link with quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple approximation of the noncommutative integral in noncommutative geometry for the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of spectrally truncated spectral triples. A close connection between this approximation and the field of quantum ergodicity and work by Widom in particular immediately provides a Szeg\H{o} limit formula for noncommutative geometry. We then make a connection to the density of states. Finally, we propose a definition for the ergodicity of geodesic flow for compact spectral triples. This definition is known in quantum ergodicity as uniqueness of the vacuum state for $C^*$-dynamical systems, and for spectral triples where local Weyl laws hold this implies that the Dirac operator of the spectral triple is quantum ergodic. This brings to light a close connection between quantum ergodicity and Connes' integral formula.</description>

      <title>Density of irreducible operators in the trace-class norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1968, Paul Halmos initiated the research on density of the set of irreducible operators on a separable Hilbert space. Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\Vert K \Vert_1 &lt; \varepsilon$?
  For $p&gt;1$, to prove the $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\Vert \cdot \Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.
  In the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras. Moreover, we discover that there is a strong connection between the problem and another related operator-theoretical problem related to type $\mathrm{II}_1$ von Neumann algebras.</description>
