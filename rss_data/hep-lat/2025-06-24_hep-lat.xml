      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the false vacuum decay at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The false vacuum decay rate is of important meaning in understanding the Universe, such as the symmetry breaking process in the early universe and the age of our universe, which is conventionally calculated with the saddle-point approximation in the field theory. Utilizing the extension of the Wigner function in quantum field theory, we numerically calculate the decay rate of the false vacuum through path integral. We study the decay rate for the thermal fluctuation scenarios and its dependence on the potential shape, and found that the false vacuum decay occurs following an exponentially decay rate, and the speed of vacuum decay decreases when the initial energy of the system decreases and the potential height increase. The discrepancy between the simulation results and the theoretical prediction of finite temperature effective field theory is observed.</description>

      <title>A hybrid nonet with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ or a tetraquark 81-plet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confirming the existence of hybrid states remains challenging due to their experimental indistinguishability from tightly bound tetraquarks and loosely bound molecules. To address this issue, we employ QCD sum rules to systematically investigate the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ as candidate tetraquark states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{-+}$. Within the hybrid framework, an $SU(3)$ flavor nonet is expected, featuring two isoscalar configurations, $q\bar{q}g$ and $s\bar{s}g$, where $q = u/d$. In contrast, the tetraquark scenario predicts an $SU(3)$ flavor 81-plet comprising three isoscalar states: $qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$, $qs\bar{q}\bar{s}$, and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$. Our analysis yields a mass of $2.22^{+0.18}_{-0.26}$ GeV for the $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state, which is expected to decay predominantly into the $\phi\phi$ and $\eta f_1(1420)$ final states. Therefore, experimental scrutiny of their invariant mass spectra is pivotal for distinguishing between hybrid and tetraquark interpretations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (HB$\chi$PT), a non-relativistic effective field theory that treats baryons as heavy static sources, to calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of spin-3/2 baryons in two sectors: the light-flavor decuplet baryons and singly heavy sextet baryons. We derive the analytical expressions up to $\mathcal{O}\left(p^3\right)$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections provide substantial contributions to the polarizabilities. In addition, magnetic dipole (M1) transitions of the baryons can significantly affect the magnetic polarizabilities and may even reverse their signs. For the decuplet baryons, the $\Delta^+$ and $\Delta^0$ exhibit the largest electric polarizabilities. Their values, $\alpha_E(\Delta^+) = (17.4 \pm 9.5)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$ and $\alpha_E(\Delta^0) = (16.9 \pm 9.2)\times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{fm}^3$, significantly exceed those typically observed for nucleons. Meanwhile, the electric polarizabilities of spin-3/2 singly heavy baryons are comparable to those of their spin-1/2 partners.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Tensor hybrid charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass and current coupling of the tensor hybrid charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=2^{-+}$ and $2^{++}$, as well as their full widths are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The spectral parameters of these states are computed using the QCD two-point sum rule approach including dimension-12 terms $ \sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2} $. The full decay widths of the charmonia $H_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$ are evaluated by considering their kinematically allowed decay channels. In the case of the hybrid state $H_{\mathrm{c}} $ decays to $D^{(\pm )}D^{\ast (\mp )}$, $D^{0} \overline{D}^{\ast 0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\pm )}D_{s}^{\ast (\mp )} $ mesons are taken into account. The processes $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast) 0}\overline{D}^{(\ast) 0}$, and $ D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast) -} $ are employed to estimate the full width of the hybrid charmonium $\widetilde{H}_{\mathrm{c}}$. The partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to calculate strong couplings at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions $m=(4.16\pm 0.14)~\mathrm{GeV}$ , and $\widetilde{m}=(4.5\pm 0.1)~\mathrm{GeV}$ for the masses and $\Gamma \left[ H_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(160\pm 30)~\mathrm{MeV}$, and $\Gamma \left[ \widetilde{H }_{\mathrm{c}}\right] =(206\pm 33)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the full width of these hybrid charmonia can be useful to study and interpret various resonances in the $4-5~\mathrm{GeV}$ mass range.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the electromagnetic structure and intrinsic dynamics of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm pentaquarks: A comprehensive QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties$-$ specifically, the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments$-$ of six hidden-charm pentaquark states: $[u u][d c] \bar c$, $[dd][u c] \bar c$, $[u u][s c] \bar c$, $[dd] [s c] \bar c$, $[s s][u c] \bar c$, and $[s s][d c] \bar c$. Employing the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules and utilizing two distinct diquark-diquark-antiquark interpolating currents, we focus on pentaquark configurations with spin-parity quantum numbers $\mathrm{J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-}$. From the numerical results, we observe significant deviations between the magnetic dipole moment predictions obtained using different diquark-diquark-antidiquark structures. These results suggest that multiple pentaquark states with identical quantum numbers and quark constituents may exhibit distinct magnetic dipole moments, depending on their internal quark configurations. The obtained electromagnetic moments, particularly the variations in magnetic dipole moments, may provide insights into the internal structure of hidden-charm pentaquark states.</description>
