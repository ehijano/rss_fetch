      <title>A diffusion MRI tractography atlas for concurrent white matter mapping across Eastern and Western populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of brain differences across Eastern and Western populations provides vital insights for understanding potential cultural and genetic influences on cognition and mental health. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter (WM) connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. However, a comprehensive investigation into WM fiber tracts between Eastern and Western populations is challenged due to the lack of a cross-population WM atlas and the large site-specific variability of dMRI data. This study presents a dMRI tractography atlas, namely the East-West WM Atlas, for concurrent WM mapping between Eastern and Western populations and creates a large, harmonized dMRI dataset (n=306) based on the Human Connectome Project and the Chinese Human Connectome Project. The curated WM atlas, as well as subject-specific data including the harmonized dMRI data, the whole brain tractography data, and parcellated WM fiber tracts and their diffusion measures, are publicly released. This resource is a valuable addition to facilitating the exploration of brain commonalities and differences across diverse cultural backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Do the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex span a variability over the degree of elongation of the receptive fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents results of combining (i) theoretical analysis regarding connections between the orientation selectivity and the elongation of receptive fields for the affine Gaussian derivative model with (ii) biological measurements of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex, to investigate if (iii) the receptive fields can be regarded as spanning a variability in the degree of elongation.
  From an in-depth theoretical analysis of idealized models for the receptive fields of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex, we have established that the directional selectivity becomes more narrow with increasing elongation of the receptive fields. By comparison with previously established biological results, concerning broad vs. sharp orientation tuning of visual neurons in the primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that those underlying theoretical predictions, in combination with these biological results, are consistent with a previously formulated biological hypothesis, stating that the biological receptive field shapes should span the degrees of freedom in affine image transformations, to support affine covariance over the population of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex.
  Based on this possible indirect support for the working hypothesis concerning affine covariance, we formulate a set of testable predictions that could be used to, with neurophysiological experiments, judge if the receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of higher mammals could be regarded as spanning a variability over the eccentricity or the elongation of the receptive fields, and, if so, then also characterize if such a variability would, in a structured way, be related to the pinwheel structure in the visual cortex.</description>

      <title>Escape time in bistable neuronal populations driven by colored synaptic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local networks of neurons are nonlinear systems driven by synaptic currents elicited by its own spiking activity and the input received from other brain areas. Synaptic currents are well approximated by correlated Gaussian noise. Besides, the population dynamics of neuronal networks is often found to be multistable, allowing the noise source to induce state transitions. State changes in neuronal systems underlies the way information is encoded and transformed. The characterization of the escape time from metastable states is then a cornerstone to understand how information is processed in the brain. The effects of correlated input forcing bistable systems have been studied for over half a century, nonetheless most results are perturbative or valid only when a separation of time scales is present. Here, we present a novel and exact result holding when the correlation time of the noise source is identical to that of the neural population, hence solving in a very general setting the mean escape time problem.</description>

      <title>Data Science In Olfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in neural sensing technology are making it possible to observe the olfactory process in great detail. In this paper, we conceptualize smell from a Data Science and AI perspective, that relates the properties of odorants to how they are sensed and analyzed in the olfactory system from the nose to the brain. Drawing distinctions to color vision, we argue that smell presents unique measurement challenges, including the complexity of stimuli, the high dimensionality of the sensory apparatus, as well as what constitutes ground truth. In the face of these challenges, we argue for the centrality of odorant-receptor interactions in developing a theory of olfaction. Such a theory is likely to find widespread industrial applications, and enhance our understanding of smell, and in the longer-term, how it relates to other senses and language. As an initial use case of the data, we present results using machine learning-based classification of neural responses to odors as they are recorded in the mouse olfactory bulb with calcium imaging.</description>

      <title>Alljoined -- A dataset for EEG-to-Image decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Alljoined, a dataset built specifically for EEG-to-Image decoding. Recognizing that an extensive and unbiased sampling of neural responses to visual stimuli is crucial for image reconstruction efforts, we collected data from 8 participants looking at 10,000 natural images each. We have currently gathered 46,080 epochs of brain responses recorded with a 64-channel EEG headset. The dataset combines response-based stimulus timing, repetition between blocks and sessions, and diverse image classes with the goal of improving signal quality. For transparency, we also provide data quality scores. We publicly release the dataset and all code at https://linktr.ee/alljoined1.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic model of relapse in drug addiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than 60% of individuals recovering from substance use disorder relapse within one year. Some will resume drug consumption even after decades of abstinence. The cognitive and psychological mechanisms that lead to relapse are not completely understood, but stressful life experiences and external stimuli that are associated with past drug-taking are known to play a primary role. Stressors and cues elicit memories of drug-induced euphoria and the expectation of relief from current anxiety, igniting an intense craving to use again; positive experiences and supportive environments may mitigate relapse. We present a mathematical model of relapse in drug addiction that draws on known psychiatric concepts such as the "positive activation; negative activation" paradigm and the "peak-end" rule to construct a relapse rate that depends on external factors (intensity and timing of life events) and individual traits (mental responses to these events). We analyze which combinations and ordering of stressors, cues, and positive events lead to the largest relapse probability and propose interventions to minimize the likelihood of relapse. We find that the best protective factor is exposure to a mild, yet continuous, source of contentment, rather than large, episodic jolts of happiness.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Brain-Computer Interfaces for People with Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling condition that leads to various neurological symptoms. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) may substitute some lost function; however, there is a lack of BCI research in people with MS. To progress this research area effectively and efficiently, we aimed to evaluate user needs and assess the feasibility and user-centric requirements of a BCI for people with MS. We conducted an online survey of 34 people with MS to qualitatively assess user preferences and establish the initial steps of user-centred design. The survey aimed to understand their interest and preferences in BCI and bionic applications. We demonstrated widespread interest for BCI applications in all stages of MS, with a preference for a non-invasive (n = 12) or minimally invasive (n = 15) BCI over carer assistance (n = 6). Qualitative assessment indicated that this preference was not influenced by level of independence. Additionally, strong interest was noted in bionic technology for sensory and autonomic functions. Considering the potential to enhance independence and quality of life for people living with MS, the results emphasise the importance of user-centred design for future advancement of BCIs that account for the unique pathological changes associated with MS.</description>

      <title>Orientation selectivity properties for the affine Gaussian derivative and the affine Gabor models for visual receptive fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the orientation selectivity of simple and complex cells that can be well modelled by the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields, with the purely spatial component of the receptive fields determined by oriented affine Gaussian derivatives for different orders of spatial differentiation.
  A detailed mathematical analysis is presented for the three different cases of either: (i) purely spatial receptive fields, (ii) space-time separable spatio-temporal receptive fields and (iii) velocity-adapted spatio-temporal receptive fields. Closed-form theoretical expressions for the orientation selectivity curves for idealized models of simple and complex cells are derived for all these main cases, and it is shown that the orientation selectivity of the receptive fields becomes more narrow, as a scale parameter ratio $\kappa$, defined as the ratio between the scale parameters in the directions perpendicular to vs. parallel with the preferred orientation of the receptive field, increases. It is also shown that the orientation selectivity becomes more narrow with increasing order of spatial differentiation in the underlying affine Gaussian derivative operators over the spatial domain.
  For comparison, we also present a corresponding theoretical orientation selectivity analysis for purely spatial receptive fields according to an affine Gabor model. The results from that analysis are consistent with the results obtained from the affine Gaussian derivative model,in the respect that the orientation selectivity becomes more narrow when making the receptive fields wider in the direction perpendicular to the preferred orientation of the receptive field.</description>

      <title>N-Body Oscillator Interactions of Higher-Order Coupling Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method to identify phase equations that include $N$-body interactions for general coupled oscillators valid far beyond the weak coupling approximation. This strategy is an extension of the theory from [Park and Wilson, SIADS 20.3 (2021)] and yields coupling functions for $N\geq2$ oscillators for arbitrary types of coupling (e.g., diffusive, gap-junction, chemical synaptic). These coupling functions enable the study of oscillator networks in terms of phase-locked states, whose stability can be determined using straightforward linear stability arguments. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two examples. First, we use $N=3$ diffusively coupled complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model and show that the loss of stability in its splay state occurs through a Hopf bifurcation \yp{as a function of non-weak diffusive coupling. Our reduction also captures asymptotic limit-cycle dynamics in the phase differences}. Second, we use $N=3$ realistic conductance-based thalamic neuron models and show that our method correctly predicts a loss in stability of a splay state for non-weak synaptic coupling. In both examples, our theory accurately captures model behaviors that weak and recent non-weak coupling theories can not.</description>

      <title>Aspects of human memory and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are huge artificial neural networks which primarily serve to generate text, but also provide a very sophisticated probabilistic model of language use. Since generating a semantically consistent text requires a form of effective memory, we investigate the memory properties of LLMs and find surprising similarities with key characteristics of human memory. We argue that the human-like memory properties of the Large Language Model do not follow automatically from the LLM architecture but are rather learned from the statistics of the training textual data. These results strongly suggest that the biological features of human memory leave an imprint on the way that we structure our textual narratives.</description>
