      <title>Boundary Value Problems for p-Adic Elliptic Parisi-Z\'u\~niga Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic integral-differential operators resembling the classical elliptic partial differential equations are defined over a compact d-dimensional p-adic domain together with associated Sobolev spaces relying on coordinate Vladimirov-type Laplacians dating back to an idea of Wilson Z\'u\~niga-Galindo in his previous work. The associated Poisson equations under boundary conditions are solved and their $L_2$-spectra are determined. Under certain finiteness conditions, a Markov semigroup acting on the Sobolev spaces which are also Hilbert spaces can be associated with such an operator and the boundary condition. It is shown that this also has an explicitly given heat kernel as an $L_2$-function, which allows a Green function to be derived from it.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Hilbert's Sixth Problem: Derivation of Fluid Equations via Boltzmann's Kinetic Theory" by Deng, Hani, and Ma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deng, Hani, and Ma [arXiv:2503.01800] claim to resolve Hilbert's Sixth Problem by deriving the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations from Newtonian mechanics via an iterated limit: a Boltzmann-Grad limit (\(\varepsilon \to 0\), \(N \varepsilon^{d-1} = \alpha\) fixed) yielding the Boltzmann equation, followed by a hydrodynamic limit (\(\alpha \to \infty\)) to obtain fluid dynamics. Though mathematically rigorous, their approach harbors two critical physical flaws. First, the vanishing volume fraction (\(N \varepsilon^d \to 0\)) confines the system to a dilute gas, incapable of embodying dense fluid properties even as \(\alpha\) scales, rendering the resulting equations a rescaled gas model rather than a true continuum. Second, the Boltzmann equation's reliance on molecular chaos collapses in fluid-like regimes, where recollisions and correlations invalidate its derivation from Newtonian dynamics. These inconsistencies expose a disconnect between the formalism and the physical essence of fluids, failing to capture emergent, density-driven phenomena central to Hilbert's vision. We contend that the Sixth Problem remains open, urging a rethink of classical kinetic theory's limits and the exploration of alternative frameworks to unify microscale mechanics with macroscale fluid behavior.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of a Signorini-type history-dependent variational inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a history-dependent variational inequality (P) which models the frictionless contact between a viscoelastic body and a rigid obstacle covered by a layer of soft material. The inequality is expressed in terms of the displacement field, is governed by the data f (related to the applied body forces and surface tractions) and, under appropriate assumptions, it has a unique solution, denoted by u. Our aim in this paper is to perform a sensitivity analysis of the inequality (P), including the study of the regularity of the solution operator $f \mapsto u$. To this end, we start by proving the equivalence of (P) with a fixed point problem, denoted by (Q). We then consider an associated optimal control problem, for which we present an existence result. Then, we prove the directional differentiability of the solution operator and show that the directional derivative is characterized by a history-dependent variational inequality with time-dependent constraints. Finally, we prove two well-posedness results in the study of problems (P) and (Q), respectively, and compare the two well-posedness concepts employed.</description>

      <title>Corruption via Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new mathematical model governing the development of a corrupted hierarchy is derived. This model is based on the Mean Field Games theory. A retrospective problem for that model is considered. From the applied standpoint, this problem amounts to figuring out the past activity of the corrupted hierarchy using the present data for this community. Three new Carleman estimates are derived. These estimates lead to H\"older stability estimates and uniqueness results for both that retrospective problem and its generalized version. H\"older stability estimates characterize the dependence of the error in the solution of the retrospective problem from the error in the input data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linear heat equation on a bounded domain and on an exterior domain. We study estimates of any order derivatives of the solution locally in time in the Lebesgue spaces. We give a proof of the estimates in the end-point cases $p = 1, \infty$. We also obtain derivative estimates for the equation with the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage the $O(2) \times \mathbb Z$-equivariant Leray-Schauder degree and a novel characterization of the Burnside Ring $A(O(2) \times \mathbb Z_2)$ presented by Ghanem in \cite{Ghanem1} to obtain $(\rm i)$ an existence result for non-radial solutions to the problem $-\Delta u = f(z,u) + Au$, $u|_{\partial D} = 0$ and $(\rm ii)$ local and global bifurcation results for multiple branches of non-radial solutions to the one-parameter family of equations $-\Delta u = f(z,u) + \textbf{A}(\alpha)u$, $u|_{\partial D} = 0$, where $D$ is the planar unit disc, $u(z) \in \mathbb R^N$, $A : \mathbb R^N \rightarrow \mathbb R^N$ is an $N \times N$ matrix, $\textbf{A}: \mathbb R \rightarrow L(\mathbb R^N)$ is a continuous family of $N \times N$ matrices and $f: \overline D \times \mathbb R^N \rightarrow \mathbb R^N$ is a sublinear, $O(2) \times \mathbb Z_2$-equivariant function of order $o(|u|)$ as $u$ approaches the origin in $\mathbb R^N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the isolated periodic traveling wave solutions of a family of reaction-convection-diffusion equations with cubic reaction term. Existence/nonexistence of periodic traveling wave solutions are discussed in different parametric ranges. The monotonicity of the ratio of Abelian integrals is used to prove the existence of at most one limit cycle. Finally, numerical study is presented at the end.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for a nonlinear biharmonic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inverse problem for a nonlinear biharmonic operator is under consideration in the spirit of Isakov (1993) and Johansson-Nurminen-Salo (2023). We prove that a general nonlinear term of the $Q= Q(x,u, \nabla u, \Delta u)$ associated to a nonlinear biharmonic operator can be recovered from the local Cauchy data set. The proof uses first order linearization method, Runge approximation, and uniqueness results for the linearized inverse problem.</description>

      <title>When Pythagoras meets Navier-Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new method, based on a time decomposition of a Cauchy problem elaborated in [6], to retrieve the well-known $L^\infty ([0,T],L^2(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}^d))$ control of the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We precisely explain how the Pythagorean theorem in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}^d)$ allows to get the proper energy estimate; however such an argument does not work anymore in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p \neq 2$. We also deduce, by similar arguments, an already known $L^\infty ([0,T],L^1(\mathbb{R}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$ control of vorticity for $d=3$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of the kinetic Justh-Krishnaprasad type model for nematic alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stochastic Justh-Krishnaprasad flocking model and study the phase transition of the Vlasov-McKean-Fokker-Planck (VMFP) equation, which can be obtained in the mean-field limit. To describe the alignment, we use order parameters in terms of the distribution function of the kinetic model. For the constant noise case, we study the well-posedness of the VMFP equation on the torus. Based on regularity, we show that the phenomenon of phase transition is only related to the ratio between the strengths of noise and coupling. In particular, for the low-noise case, we derive an exponential convergence to the von-Mises type equilibrium, which shows a strong evidence for the nematic alignment. The multiplicative noise is also studied to obtain a non-symmetric equilibrium with two different peaks on the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a weighted version of the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) formula, both in the pointwise and $\Gamma$-convergence sense, together with a compactness criterion for energy-bounded sequences. The non-negative weights need only be $L^\infty$ convergent to a bounded and uniformly continuous limit. We apply the BBM formula to show a Poincar\'e-type inequality and the stability of the first eigenvalues relative to the energies. Finally, we discuss a non-local analogue of the weighted BBM formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of spatial discretizations for reaction-diffusion systems with mass-action law satisfying a detailed balance condition. Considering systems on the d-dimensional torus, we construct appropriate space-discrete processes and show convergence not only on the level of solutions, but also on the level of the gradient systems governing the evolutions. As an important step, we prove chain rule inequalities for the reaction-diffusion systems as well as their discretizations, featuring a non-convex dissipation functional. The convergence is then obtained with variational methods by building on the recently introduced notion of gradient systems in continuity equation format.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e constants related to isoperimetric problems in convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any convex set $\Omega \subset {\mathbb R} ^N$, we provide a lower bound for the inverse of the Poincar\'e constant in $W ^ {1, 1}(\Omega)$: it refines an inequality in terms of the diameter due to Acosta-Duran, via the addition of an extra term giving account for the flatness of the domain. In dimension $N = 2$, we are able to make the extra term completely explicit, thus providing a new Bonnesen-type inequality for the Poincar\'e constant in terms of diameter and inradius. Such estimate is sharp, and it is asymptotically attained when the domain is the intersection of a ball with a strip bounded by parallel straight lines, symmetric about the centre of the ball. As a key intermediate step, we prove that the ball maximizes the Poincar\'e constant in $W ^ {1, 1} (\Omega)$, among convex bodies $\Omega$ of given constant width.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-estimates for the wave equation with critical magnetic field in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $L^{p}$-estimates for the solution to the wave equation with a scaling-critical magnetic potential in Euclidean $R^N$ with $N\geq3$. Inspired by the work of \cite{L}, we show that the operators $(I+\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}})^{-\gamma}e^{it\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}}}$ is bounded in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$ for $1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$ when $\gamma&gt;|1/p-1/2|$ and $t&gt;0$, where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}$ is a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. In particular, we derive the $L^{p}$-bounds for the sine wave propagator $\sin(t\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}})\mathcal{L}^{-\frac12}_{\mathbf{A}}$. The key ingredient is the $L^p\rightarrow L^p$ boundedness of the analytic operator family $f_{w,t}(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}})$.</description>

Abstract: We adopt the Koch-Tataru theory for the Navier-Stokes equations, based on Carleson measure estimates, to develop a scaling-critical low-regularity framework for half-harmonic map heat flows. This nonlocal variant of the harmonic map heat flow has been studied recently in connection with free boundary minimal surfaces. We introduce a new class of initial data for the flow, broader than the conventional energy or Sobolev spaces considered in previous work, for which we establish existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Lp Minkowski problem in the supercritical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem has been a long standing problem in convex geometry. In the groundbreaking paper by Brendle-Choi-Daskalopoulos (Acta Math, {\bf219}, 2017), a full uniqueness result was shown for the subcritical exponents $p\in(-n-1,1]$. In the supercritical range, the uniqueness problem is much more complicated, even in the planar case $n=1$. One of the famous results was shown by Andrews (J. Amer. Math. Soc., {\bf16}, 2003), where he established that the uniqueness holds in the range $p\in(-7,-2)$ and fails to hold for the other supercritical exponents $p\in(-\infty,-7)$. In this paper, we study the same uniqueness problem in the full supercritical range $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$ for all higher dimensional cases $n\geq2$. We will prove that for $p\in(-2n-5,-n-1)$, the unique strongly symmetric solution is given by the unit sphere ${\mathbb{S}}^n$. The uniqueness range $(-2n-5,-n-1)$ is optimal due to our recent preprint (arXiv: 2104.07426) joint with J. Lu and Y.N. Liu, where we have constructed non-spherical strongly symmetric solutions for all $p\in(-\infty,-2n-5)$. When considering general solutions without symmetricity assumption, the uniqueness set $\Gamma$ of $p$ for which the uniqueness holds, is shown to be both relatively open and closed in the full interval $(-2n-5,-n-1)$.</description>

      <title>Extinction rates for nonradial solutions to the Stefan problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-phase Stefan problem describing the evolution of melting ice. On the one hand, we focus on understanding the evolution of the free boundary near isolated singular points, and we establish for the first time upper and (more surprisingly) lower estimates for its evolution. In 2D, these bounds almost match the best known ones for radial solutions, but hold for all solutions to the Stefan problem, with no extra assumption on the initial or boundary data. On the other hand, as a consequence of our results, we also characterize the global regularity of the free boundary, as follows: it can be written as a graph $t = \Gamma(x)$, where $\Gamma$ is $C^1$ (and not $C^2$) near any singular points in the lower strata $\Sigma_m$, $m \leq n - 2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ is not $C^1$ at singular points in $\Sigma_{n-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of non--linear and non--local functionals giving rise to the Choquard equation with a suitably regular interaction potential, modelling, i.e., gases with impurities and axion stars. We study how existence of minimizers depends on the coupling constant, and find that there is a critical interaction strength needed for the minimizers to exist, both in dimensions two and three. In $d=3$, a minimizer exists also at the critical coupling but none do in $d=2$ under suitable assumptions on the potential. We also establish the existence of non--minimizing critical points in $d=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the FitzHugh-Nagumo system on undulated cylindrical surfaces modeling nerve axons. We show that for sufficiently small radii and for initial conditions close to radially symmetrical ones, (i) the solutions converge to their radial averages, and (ii) the latter averages can be approximated by solutions of a 1+1 dimensional ('radial') system (the effective system) involving the surface radius function in its coefficients. This perhaps explains why solutions of the original 1+1 dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo system agree so well with experimental data on electrical impulse propagation.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>

      <title>Convergence to the equilibrium for the kinetic transport equation in the two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Boltzmann-Grad limit of the two-dimensional periodic Lorentz Gas. It has been proved in [6,14,4] that the time evolution of a probability density on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\ni(x,v)$ is obtained by extending the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1$ to $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\times[0,+\infty)\times[-1,1]$, where $s\in[0,+\infty)$ represents the time to the next collision and $h\in[-1,1]$ the corresponding impact parameter. Here we prove that under suitable conditions the time evolution of an initial datum in $L^p(\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{T}^1\times[0,+\infty)\times[-1,1])$ converges to the equilibrium state with respect to the $L^p$ norm ($^*$-weakly if $p=\infty$). If $p=2$, or if the initial datum does not depend on $x$, we also get more precise estimates about the rate of the approach to the equilibrium. Our proof is based on the analysis of the long time behavior of the Fourier coefficients of the solution.</description>

Abstract: At a finite-time singularity of harmonic map flow in the critical dimension, we show that a Lojasiewicz inequality between the quantities appearing in Struwe's monotonicity formula implies continuity of the body map and the no-neck property for bubble-tree decompositions. We prove such an inequality when the target is $S^2,$ yielding both properties in this case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain upper bounds for the critical time $T^*$ of the blow-up for the parabolic-elliptic Patlak-Keller-Segel system on the 2D-Euclidean space. No moment condition or/and entropy condition are required on the initial data; only the usual assumptions of non-negativity and finiteness of the mass is assumed. The result is expressed not only in terms of the supercritical mass $M&gt; 8\pi$, but also in terms of the {\it shape} of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Sloshing in containers with vertical walls: isoperimetric inequalities for the fundamental eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One isoperimetric inequality for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue is derived under the assumption that containers have vertical side walls and either finite or infinite depth. It asserts that among all such containers, whose free surfaces are convex, have two axes of symmetry and a given perimeter length, this eigenvalue is maximized by infinitely deep ones provided the free surface is either the square or the equilateral triangle. The proof is based on the recent isoperimetric result obtained by A. Henrot, A. Lemenant and I.~Lucardesi for the first nonzero eigenvalue of the two-dimensional Neumann Laplacian under the perimeter constraint.
  Another isoperimetric inequality for the fundamental eigenvalue, which describes sloshing in containers with vertical walls, is a consequence of the classical result due to G. Szeg\H o concerning the first nonzero eigenvalue of the free membrane problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of a doubling metric measure space, we study regularity of sets with finite $s$-perimeter, that is, sets whose characteristic functions have finite Besov energy, with regularity parameter $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and exponent $p=1$. Following a result of Visintin in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we provide a sufficient condition for finiteness of the $s$-perimeter given in terms of the upper Minkowski codimension of the regularized boundary of the set. We also show that if a set has finite $s$-perimeter, then its measure-theoretic boundary has codimension $s$ Hausdorff measure zero. To the best of our knowledge, this result is new even in the Euclidean setting. By studying certain fat Cantor sets, we provide examples illustrating that the converses of these results do not hold in general. In the doubling metric measure space setting, we then consider minimizers of a nonlocal perimeter functional, extending the definition introduced by Caffarelli, Roquejoffre, and Savin in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and prove existence, uniform density, and porosity results for minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming as hypotheses the results proved numerically by Chang et al. \cite{Chang} for the exponent $p\in (3,5)$, we prove that some of the ground states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with pure power nonlinearity of exponent $p$ in the line are asymptotically stable for a certain set of values of the exponent $p$ where the FGR occurs by means of a discrete mode 3rd or 4th order power interaction with the continuous mode. For the 3rd the result is true for generic $p$ while for the 4th order case we assume that there are $p$'s satisfying Fermi Golden rule and the non-resonance condition of the threshold of the continuous spectrum of the linearization. The argument is similar to our recent result valid for $p$ near 3 contained in \cite{CM24D1}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $d$-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with general power nonlinearity and a delta potential. Our interest lies in the interplay between two localization mechanisms. On the one hand, the attractive (repulsive) delta potential acting as a point defect breaks the translational invariance of the lattice so that a linear staggering (non-staggering) bound state is formed with negative (positive) energy. On the other hand, focusing nonlinearity may lead to self-trapping of excitation energy. For focusing nonlinearity we prove the existence of a spatially exponentially localized and time-periodic ground state and investigate the impact of an attractive respectively repulsive delta potential on the existence of an excitation threshold, i.e. supercritical $l^2$ norm, for the creation of such a ground states. Explicit expressions for the lower excitation thresholds are given. Reciprocally, we discuss the influence of defocusing nonlinearity on the durability of the linear bound states and provide upper thresholds of the $l^2-$norm for their preservation. Regarding the asymptotic behavior of the solutions we establish that for a $l^2-$norm below the excitation threshold the solutions scatter to a solution of the linear problem in $l^{p&gt;2}$.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by establishing new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

In particular, we establish that the logarithm of the ratio of the $L^p$ norm to the $L^1$ norm decreases super-exponentially fast during the initial phase, subsequently decaying to zero exponentially fast in the latter phase. This implies that if the initial data is solely in $L^1$, then for $t&gt;0$, the solution will belong to $L^p$ for any $p\in [1,\infty)$. The results are obtained under the assumption of a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Sharp fractional Hardy's inequality for half-spaces in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish the following fractional Hardy's inequality
  $$C\int_{\mathbb{H}^n_+}\frac{|f(\xi)|^p}{x_1^{sp+\alpha}}d\xi\leq \int_{\mathbb{H}^n}\int_{\mathbb{H}^n}\frac{|f(\xi)-f(\xi')|^p}{d({\xi}^{-1}\circ \xi')^{Q+sp}|z'-z|^\alpha}d\xi'd\xi,\ \ \forall f\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{H}^n_+)$$
  for the half-space $\mathbb{H}^n_+=\{\xi=(x,y,t)=(x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n)\in\mathbb{H}^n:x_1&gt;0\}$ in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ without any restriction on parameters, and compute the corresponding sharp constant. In a previous joint work, we established a variant of Hardy's inequality for the same half-space, but with certain parameter restrictions. However, all integrals in that work were considered over half-spaces, and here the seminorm is taken over the entire $\mathbb{H}^n$. Although this inequality holds for all values of the quantity $sp+\alpha$, we are only able to compute the corresponding sharp constant when $sp+\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Abstract Fractional Cauchy Problem: Existence of Propagators and Inhomogeneous Solution Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous differential equation given in terms of an unbounded linear operator $A$ and the Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ in time. The previously known representation of the mild solution to such a problem does not have a conventional variation-of-constants like form, with the propagator derived from the associated homogeneous problem. Instead, it relies on the existence of two propagators with different analytical properties. This fact limits theoretical and especially numerical applicability of the existing solution representation. Here, we propose an alternative representation of the mild solution to the given problem, that consolidates the solution formulas for sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with a positive sectorial operator $A$ and non-zero initial data. The new representation is solely based on the propagator of the homogeneous problem and, therefore, can be considered as a more natural fractional extension of the solution to the classical parabolic Cauchy problem. By exploiting a trade-off between the regularity assumptions on the initial data in terms of the fractional powers of $A$ and the regularity assumptions on the right-hand side in time, we show that the proposed solution formula is strongly convergent for $t \geq 0$ under considerably weaker assumptions compared to the standard results from the literature. Crucially, the achieved relaxation of space regularity assumptions ensures that the new solution representation is practically feasible for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$ and is amenable to the numerical evaluation using uniformly accurate quadrature-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lojasiewicz inequalities for maps of the 2-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality $$ \left| E(u) - 4\pi n \right| \leq C \| \mathcal{T}(u) \|^\alpha $$ for maps $u \in W^{2,2}\left( S^2, S^2 \right).$ The inequality holds with $\alpha = 1$ in general and with $\alpha &gt; 1$ unless $u$ is nearly constant on an open set. We obtain polynomial convergence of weak solutions of harmonic map flow $u(t) : S^2 \to S^2$ as $t \to \infty$ on compact domains away from the singular set, assuming that the body map is nonconstant. The proof uses Topping's repulsion estimates together with polynomial lower bounds on the energy density coming from a bubble-tree induction argument.</description>

Abstract: In this note we show how canonical transformations reveal hidden convexity properties for deterministic optimal control problems, which in turn result in global existence of $C^{1,1}_{loc}$ solutions to first order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations.</description>

      <title>Collapsing immortal K\"ahler-Ricci flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds with semiample canonical bundle and intermediate Kodaira dimension, and show that the flow collapses to a canonical metric on the base of the Iitaka fibration in the locally smooth topology and with bounded Ricci curvature away from the singular fibers. This follows from an asymptotic expansion for the evolving metrics, in the spirit of recent work of the first and third-named authors on collapsing Calabi-Yau metrics, and proves two conjectures of Song and Tian.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse, admissible complex metrics, and foliation changing diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a codimension-one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms can be rendered explicit in a reformulation as a rank one perturbation. Applied to scalar field theories a Lorentzian signature action develops a positive imaginary part thereby identifying the underlying complex metric as ``admissible''. This admissibility is ensured in non-fiducial foliations in technically distinct ways also for the variation with respect to the metric and for the Hessian. The Hessian of the Wick rotated action is a complex combination of a generalized Laplacian and a d'Alembertian, which is shown to have spectrum contained in a wedge of the upper complex half plane. Specialized to near Minkowski space the induced propagator differs from the one with the Feynman $i\epsilon$ prescription and on Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre backgrounds the difference to a Wick rotation in time is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Construction of $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct canonical $p$-energy measures associated with strongly local $p$-energy forms without any assumptions of self-similarity, where $p$-energy forms are $L^p$-versions of Dirichlet forms, which have recently been studied mainly on fractals. Furthermore, we prove that the measures satisfy the chain and Leibniz rules, and that such a "good" energy measures are unique. As an application, we also prove the $p$-energy version of Mosco's domination principle.</description>

      <title>Architecture independent generalization bounds for overparametrized deep ReLU networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that overparametrized neural networks are able to generalize with a test error that is independent of the level of overparametrization, and independent of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. We prove explicit bounds that only depend on the metric geometry of the test and training sets, on the regularity properties of the activation function, and on the operator norms of the weights and norms of biases. For overparametrized deep ReLU networks with a training sample size bounded by the input space dimension, we explicitly construct zero loss minimizers without use of gradient descent, and prove that the generalization error is independent of the network architecture.</description>
