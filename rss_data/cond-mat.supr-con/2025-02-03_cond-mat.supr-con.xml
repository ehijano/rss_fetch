      <title>Direct Visualization of an Incommensurate Unidirectional Charge Density Wave in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges in both La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure by suppressing their density-wave transitions, but critical temperature (Tc) differs significantly between these two compounds. To gain deeper insights into the distinct superconducting states, it is essential to unravel the nature of the density-wave states at ambient pressure, a topic that remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the direct visualization of an incommensurate unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ in real space. The density of states (DOS) is strongly depleted near $E_F$, indicating the opening of a CDW gap of $2{\Delta} \approx 71$ meV, which is unfavorable for the formation of superconductivity at ambient pressure. We propose that the CDW arises from Fermi surface nesting, and is likely a subsidiary phase of a spin density wave. Compared to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the weaker electronic correlation in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ is likely one reason for the lower $T_c$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recommendations for how to improve reproducibility in the field of condensed matter physics. This area of physics has consistently produced both fundamental insights into the functioning of matter as well as transformative inventions. Our recommendations result from a collaboration that includes researchers in academia and government laboratories, scientific journalists, legal professionals, representatives of publishers, professional societies, and other experts. The group met in person in May 2024 at a conference at the University of Pittsburgh to discuss the growing challenges related to research reproducibility in condensed matter physics. We discuss best practices and policies at all stages of the scientific process to safeguard the value condensed matter research brings to society. We look forward to comments and suggestions, especially regarding subfield-specific recommendations, and will incorporate them into the next version of the report.</description>

      <title>Unconventional high-temperature excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and analyze its superfluid properties. In particular, we estimate BKT temperatures between 75 K and 100 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductors: The role of long-range Coulomb interaction and signatures in density response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate collective excitations in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states of Pauli-limited superconducting films. When the long-range Coulomb interaction is absent, excitation spectra consist of two gapless and three gapped modes. The gapless modes are the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of the ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry and the translational symmetry. The gapped modes include the Higgs mode and the twofold degenerate modes that cause the oscillation of the domain width and grayness of FFLO nodal planes. We find that the long-range Coulomb interaction only gaps out the gapless phase mode through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, while the other modes remain unaffected. Furthermore, the field evolution of the dispersion of the gapless elastic mode, the Nambu-Goldstone mode associated with the translational symmetry breaking, is associated with that of the bandwidth of the mid-gap Andreev bound states. We demonstrate that the signature of the elastic mode can be detected by measuring the density-density response function.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Drude weight of an interacting flat-band metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored four-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>
