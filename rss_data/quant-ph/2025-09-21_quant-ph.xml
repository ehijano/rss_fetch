      <title>Simultaneous Speedmeter and Position-Meter Response in a Single Tabletop Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Heuristics for the Binary Paint Shop Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) is an $\mathsf{APX}$-hard optimisation problem in automotive manufacturing: given a sequence of $2n$ cars, comprising $n$ distinct models each appearing twice, the task is to decide which of two colours to paint each car so that the two occurrences of each model are painted differently, while minimising consecutive colour swaps. The key performance metric is the paint swap ratio, the average number of colour changes per car, which directly impacts production efficiency and cost. Prior work showed that the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) at depth $p=7$ achieves a paint swap ratio of $0.393$, outperforming the classical Recursive Greedy (RG) heuristic with an expected ratio of $0.4$ [Phys. Rev. A 104, 012403 (2021)]. More recently, the classical Recursive Star Greedy (RSG) heuristic was conjectured to achieve an expected ratio of $0.361$. In this study, we develop the theoretical foundations for applying QAOA to BPSP through a reduction of BPSP to weighted MaxCut, and use this framework to benchmark two state-of-the-art low-depth QAOA variants, eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA) and Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), at $p=1$ (denoted XQAOA$_1$ and RQAOA$_1$), against the strongest classical heuristics known to date. Across instances ranging from $2^7$ to $2^{12}$ cars, XQAOA$_1$ achieves an average ratio of $0.357$, surpassing RQAOA$_1$ and all classical heuristics, including the conjectured performance of RSG. Surprisingly, RQAOA$_1$ shows diminishing performance as size increases: despite using provably optimal QAOA$_1$ parameters at each recursion, it is outperformed by RSG on most $2^{11}$-car instances and all $2^{12}$-car instances. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report RQAOA$_1$'s performance degradation at scale. In contrast, XQAOA$_1$ remains robust, indicating strong potential to asymptotically surpass all known heuristics.</description>

      <title>Integrated high-fidelity preparation and analysis of photonic two-qubit states for quantum network nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realisation of quantum networks requires local quantum information processing at the network nodes and highly efficient transmission of quantum information across the network. Integrated photonics, based on silicon-on-insulator, is a promising platform for quantum network nodes, as it supports low-loss propagation of telecom wavelength photons, making it compatible with existing optical fibre networks. Here, we present a silicon-on-insulator integrated photonic chip, capable of bidirectional operation, enabling the preparation of arbitrary single- and two-qubit states, and performing full quantum state tomography on up to two qubits. Using our chip, we obtain preparation fidelities above 97% for on-chip prepared Bell states coupled into optical fibres. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can distribute entanglement between network nodes by preparing a two-qubit cluster state on the first node and performing full quantum state tomography on the second node, achieving a fidelity of 90.0(16)%. This result proves that our approach allows the distribution of entanglement from one chip to another. The potential of bidirectional operation makes our circuit a versatile node in telecom quantum networks, both functioning as a sender and receiver unit, a key element for the deployment of fully photonic multi-purpose quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Unentanglement and Post-Measurement Branching in Quantum Interactive Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two resources whose effects on quantum interactive proofs remain poorly understood: the promise of unentanglement, and the verifier's ability to condition on an intermediate measurement, which we call post-measurement branching. We first show that unentanglement can dramatically increase computational power: three-round unentangled quantum interactive proofs equal NEXP, even if only the first message is quantum. By contrast, we prove that if the verifier uses no post-measurement branching, then the same type of unentangled proof system has at most the power of QAM. Finally, we investigate post-measurement branching in two-round quantum-classical proof systems. Unlike the equivalence between public-coin and private-coin classical interactive proofs, we give evidence of a separation in the quantum setting that arises from post-measurement branching.</description>

      <title>Neural Architecture Search Algorithms for Quantum Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of quantum circuits is currently driven by the specific objectives of the quantum algorithm in question. This approach thus relies on a significant manual effort by the quantum algorithm designer to design an appropriate circuit for the task. However this approach cannot scale to more complex quantum algorithms in the future without exponentially increasing the circuit design effort and introducing unwanted inductive biases. Motivated by this observation, we propose to automate the process of cicuit design by drawing inspiration from Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work, we propose two Quantum-NAS algorithms that aim to find efficient circuits given a particular quantum task. We choose quantum data compression as our driver quantum task and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by finding efficient autoencoder designs that outperform baselines on three different tasks - quantum data denoising, classical data compression and pure quantum data compression. Our results indicate that quantum NAS algorithms can significantly alleviate the manual effort while delivering performant quantum circuits for any given task.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum computing with a high-rate symplectic double code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate and large-distance quantum codes are expected to make fault-tolerant quantum computing more efficient, but most of them lack efficient fault-tolerant encoded-state preparation methods. We propose such a fault-tolerant encoder for a [[30, 6, 5]] symplectic double code. The advantage of this code is its compactness, in addition to its high encoding rate, allowing for early experimental realization. Detecting crucial errors during encoding with as few auxiliary qubits as possible, our encoder can reduce resource overheads while keeping low logical error rates, compared to more naive methods. Numerical simulations with a circuit-level noise model demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method. We also develop an arbitrary-state encoder that enables the injection of arbitrary quantum states into the code space. Combined with basic fault-tolerant operations, this supports universal quantum computation. We thus demonstrate that efficient and reliable logical state preparation is achievable even for a compact and high-rate code, offering a potential step toward efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing suitable for near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Topology and Spectral Entanglement in Cavity-Mediated Photon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a diagrammatic theory of cavity-mediated photon-photon interactions in a topological insulator using the SSH model. The fourth-order vertex $\Gamma^{(4)}(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ governs spectral entanglement and Kerr nonlinearity, leading to a nonlinear topological phase diagram. We also compute the electronic self-energy from vacuum photon exchange and identify symmetry-imposed limits on band renormalization. These results link band geometry to the emergence of light-matter correlations.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations in Two- and Three-Dimensional Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting momentum-resolved excitation spectra in strongly correlated quantum systems remains a major challenge, especially beyond one spatial dimension. We present an efficient tensor-network approach to compute dispersion relations via imaginary-time evolution within the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) framework. Benchmarking on the transverse-field Ising model, the method successfully captures dispersion relations in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases for two- and three-dimensional lattices, achieving strong agreement with series expansion methods, where these are applicable. Crucially, this work presents the first demonstration of dispersion relation calculations for three-dimensional quantum lattice models - a long-standing computational challenge that opens entirely new research frontiers. The method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, requiring only modest computational resources while maintaining high accuracy across wide parameter ranges. Its broad applicability makes it a powerful tool for quantum simulation, photonic material design, and quantum information platforms requiring precise momentum-resolved spectra.</description>

      <title>Full Quantum Stack: Ket Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware continues to scale, the need for a robust software infrastructure that bridges the gap between high-level algorithm development and low-level physical qubit control becomes increasingly critical. A full-stack approach, analogous to classical computing, is essential for managing complexity, enabling hardware-agnostic programming, and systematically optimizing performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, end-to-end quantum software stack, detailing each layer of abstraction from user-facing code to hardware execution. We begin at the highest level with the Ket quantum programming platform, which provides an expressive, Python-based interface for algorithm development. We then describe the crucial multi-stage compilation process, which translates hardware-agnostic programs into hardware-compliant circuits by handling gate decomposition, qubit mapping to respect device connectivity, and native gate translation. To illustrate the complete workflow, we present a concrete example, compiling the Grover diffusion operator for a superconducting quantum processor. Finally, we connect the compiled circuit to its physical realization by explaining how native gates are implemented through calibrated microwave pulses. This includes the calibration of single- and two-qubit gates, frequency characterization, and measurement procedures, providing a clear picture of how abstract quantum programs ultimately map onto the physical control of a quantum processor. By providing a detailed blueprint of a complete quantum stack, this work illuminates the critical interplay between software abstractions and physical hardware, establishing a framework for developing practical and performant quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Discrete Flow-Based Generative Models for Measurement Optimization in Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving chemical accuracy in quantum simulations is often constrained by the measurement bottleneck: estimating operators requires a large number of shots, which remains costly even on fault-tolerant devices and is further exacerbated on today's noisy hardware by finite circuit fidelity and error-mitigation overhead. Addressing this challenge involves a multiobjective optimization problem that balances total shot count, the number of distinct measurement circuits, and hardware-specific compilation constraints. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic graph-coloring strategies to group commuting or qubit-wise commuting Hamiltonian terms, or on greedy allocation schemes for distributing measurements. Such approaches explore only a limited portion of the combinatorial solution space, potentially missing superior solutions. We introduce an algorithm that adapts Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) for coloring graph representations of Hamiltonians, enabling the generation of diverse, high-quality groupings. Our approach samples colored graphs in proportion to a user-defined reward, naturally capturing multiobjective trade-offs and discovering multiple competitive solutions. On benchmark molecular Hamiltonians, our method outperforms sorted-insertion baselines by reducing measurement costs. We further analyze the role of composite rewards, incorporating both the number of circuits and measurement costs, leading to additional improvements. This generative policy framework not only reduces measurement costs but also offers flexibility for potential hardware-aware adaptations through its reward function.</description>

      <title>QuantEM: The quantum error management compiler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward fault-tolerant architectures, quantum error detection (QED) has emerged as a practical and scalable intermediate strategy in the transition from error mitigation to full error correction. By identifying and discarding faulty runs rather than correcting them, QED enables improved reliability with significantly lower overhead. Applying QED to arbitrary quantum circuits remains challenging, however, because of the need for manual insertion of detection subcircuits, ancilla allocation, and hardware-specific mapping and scheduling.
  We present QuantEM, a modular and extensible compiler designed to automate the integration of QED codes into arbitrary quantum programs. Our compiler consists of three key modules: (1) program analysis and transformation module to examine quantum programs in a QED-aware context and introduce checks and ancilla qubits, (2) error detection code integration module to map augmented circuits onto specific hardware backends, and (3) postprocessing and resource management for measurement results postprocessing and resource-efficient estimation techniques. The compiler accepts a high-level quantum circuit, a chosen error detection code, and a target hardware topology and then produces an optimized and executable circuit. It can also automatically select an appropriate detection code for the user based on circuit structure and resource estimates. QuantEM currently supports Pauli check sandwiching and Iceberg codes and is designed to support future QED schemes and hardware targets. By automating the complex QED compilation flow, this work reduces developer burden, enables fast code exploration, and ensures consistent and correct application of detection logic across architectures.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Driven Transitions between Area Law Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum circuits consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements have become valuable tools for stimulating or preparing quantum many-body states with non-trivial properties. Here, we introduce and examine a measurement-only circuit (the projective quantum Ising model with three-spin interactions) that involves three non-commuting projective measurements. This model features three distinct phases, separated by two critical lines. We utilize two entanglement measures (topological entanglement entropy and mutual information) to identify the phase boundaries and derive various critical exponents through scaling analysis. We establish a relationship between our model and a two-dimensional statistical model (bond percolation) within certain limits. We hope that our results will shed light on further studies using other measurement-only models.</description>

      <title>Bose's Probabilistic Interactions, Einstein's Objections, and Their Legacy in Quantum Optics and Stochastic Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1924, S. N. Bose proposed (i) a new counting method for photons and (ii) a probabilistic law of microscopic matter-radiation interactions, treating emission and absorption as two aspects of a single, field-dependent process. While Einstein enthusiastically extended Bose's counting to material particles, he sharply criticized the probabilistic law, invoking detailed balance and the correspondence principle. This paper argues that (i) once one distinguishes encounter probabilities from transition rates, Einstein's concerns can be reconciled, and (ii) that modern quantum optics and cavity QED vindicate Bose's core intuition: ``spontaneous'' emission is not an intrinsic property of an isolated atom, as Einstein had assumed, but emerges from its coupling to the quantized field, with the rate set by the local photonic mode structure (LDOS/Purcell effect), all while satisfying Einstein's correspondence requirement in the classical (high-intensity) limit. It is further suggested that stochastic-mechanics models--persistent random walks leading to the telegrapher's equation, with diffusive and chiral limits yielding the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations--accord more closely with Bose's view of fundamental randomness than standard quantum mechanics, and furnish a mesoscopic bridge that reconciles micro-level stochasticity with Einstein's demand for the correct classical limit.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Robust self-testing of quantum steering assemblages via operator inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust self-testing provides a framework for certifying quantum resources under experimental imperfections. Improving robustness bounds for quantum resources such as quantum states, steering assemblages, and measurements is a constant effort that ensures relevance in the experimental realm. Despite progress in analytic self-testing methods for quantum states and measurements, extending these techniques to device-independent certification of steering assemblages has remained an open challenge, with previous work relying primarily on numerical approaches. We address this gap by developing operator inequalities for robust self-testing of quantum steering assemblages. Specifically, we consider the assemblage that achieves maximal violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality and obtain explicit lower bounds on its certification fidelity. Our analytic approach yields results that significantly improve upon previous numerical bounds, representing the first analytic treatment of device-independent assemblage self-testing. This work demonstrates a new application of operator inequalities beyond quantum state certification and contributes to the foundational understanding of device-independent certification in steering scenarios, potentially guiding future theoretical and experimental developments.</description>

      <title>Triplet Loss Based Quantum Encoding for Class Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient and data-driven encoding scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of variational quantum classifiers. This encoding is specially designed for complex datasets like images and seeks to help the classification task by producing input states that form well-separated clusters in the Hilbert space according to their classification labels. The encoding circuit is trained using a triplet loss function inspired by classical facial recognition algorithms, and class separability is measured via average trace distances between the encoded density matrices. Benchmark tests performed on various binary classification tasks on MNIST and MedMNIST datasets demonstrate considerable improvement over amplitude encoding with the same VQC structure while requiring a much lower circuit depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hybrid qubit-oscillator systems together with Gaussian, multi-qubit as well as qubit-controlled Gaussian unitaries. We propose implementations of logical gates for approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes in this model using two oscillators and three qubits. We show that these gate implementations become exact in the limit of large squeezing: The logical gate error is upper bounded by a linear function of the squeezing parameter, and depends polynomially on the number of encoded qubits. For certain Cliffords, our constructions overcome a shortcoming of well-known Gaussian implementations which have a constant logical gate error even in the absence of noise.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian learning via quantum Zeno effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is essential for understanding its dynamics and validating its behavior. Hamiltonian learning provides a data-driven approach to reconstruct the generator of the dynamics from measurements on the evolved system. Among its applications, it is particularly important for benchmarking and characterizing quantum hardware, such as quantum computers and simulators. However, as these devices grow in size and complexity, this task becomes increasingly challenging. To address this, we propose a scalable and experimentally friendly Hamiltonian learning protocol for Hamiltonian operators made of local interactions. It leverages the quantum Zeno effect as a reshaping tool to localize the system's dynamics and then applies quantum process tomography to learn the coefficients of a local subset of the Hamiltonian acting on selected qubits. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require complex state preparations and uses experimentally accessible, coherence-preserving operations. We derive theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol both with numerical simulations and through an experimental implementation on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware, successfully learning the coefficients of a 109-qubit Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Impact of Single Rotations and Entanglement Topologies in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an analysis of the performance of different Variational Quantum Circuits is presented, investigating how it changes with respect to entanglement topology, adopted gates, and Quantum Machine Learning tasks to be performed. The objective of the analysis is to identify the optimal way to construct circuits for Quantum Neural Networks. In the presented experiments, two types of circuits are used: one with alternating layers of rotations and entanglement, and the other, similar to the first one, but with an additional final layer of rotations. As rotation layers, all combinations of one and two rotation sequences are considered. Four different entanglement topologies are compared: linear, circular, pairwise, and full. Different tasks are considered, namely the generation of probability distributions and images, and image classification. Achieved results are correlated with the expressibility and entanglement capability of the different circuits to understand how these features affect performance.</description>

      <title>Training Variational Quantum Circuits Using Particle Swarm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to train various Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs). This approach is motivated by the fact that commonly used gradient-based optimization methods can suffer from the barren plateaus problem. PSO is a stochastic optimization technique inspired by the collective behavior of a swarm of birds. The dimension of the swarm, the number of iterations of the algorithm, and the number of trainable parameters can be set. In this study, PSO has been used to train the entire structure of VQCs, allowing it to select which quantum gates to apply, the target qubits, and the rotation angle, in case a rotation is chosen. The algorithm is restricted to choosing from four types of gates: Rx, Ry, Rz, and CNOT. The proposed optimization approach has been tested on various datasets of the MedMNIST, which is a collection of biomedical image datasets designed for image classification tasks. Performance has been compared with the results achieved by classical stochastic gradient descent applied to a predefined VQC. The results show that the PSO can achieve comparable or even better classification accuracy across multiple datasets, despite the PSO using a lower number of quantum gates than the VQC used with gradient descent optimization.</description>

      <title>CLASS: A Controller-Centric Layout Synthesizer for Dynamic Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layout Synthesis for Quantum Computing (LSQC) is a critical component of quantum design tools. Traditional LSQC studies primarily focus on optimizing for reduced circuit depth by adopting a device-centric design methodology. However, these approaches overlook the impact of classical processing and communication time, thereby being insufficient for Dynamic Quantum Circuits (DQC).
  To address this, we introduce CLASS, a controller-centric layout synthesizer designed to reduce inter-controller communication latency in a distributed control system. It consists of a two-stage framework featuring a hypergraph-based modeling and a heuristic-based graph partitioning algorithm. Evaluations demonstrate that CLASS effectively reduces communication latency by up to 100% with only a 2.10% average increase in the number of additional operations.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Gaussian Optimization for Non-Gaussian Resources in Continuous-Variable Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable systems, non-Gaussian resources are essential for achieving universal quantum computation that lies beyond classical simulation. Among the candidate states, the cubic phase state stands out as the simplest form of single-mode non-Gaussian resource, yet its experimental preparation still remains a great challenge. Although a variety of approximate schemes have been proposed to simulate the cubic phase state, they often fall short when deployed in concrete quantum tasks. In this work, we present a Gaussian optimization protocol that systematically refines the non-Gaussian resources, which significantly improves the performance of both magic-state-based and measurement-based quantum computation. Leveraging task-specific Gaussian operations on approximate cubic phase states, our protocol offers an experimentally feasible approach to enhance gate fidelity in magic-state-based quantum computation and reduce the variance of nonlinear quadrature measurement in measurement-based quantum computation. Building on this framework, we further propose a task-oriented non-Gaussian state preparation scheme based on superpositions in the Fock basis followed by squeezing and displacement. This strategy enables direct tailoring of resource states to specific task goals. Owing to its flexibility and generality, our framework provides a powerful and broadly applicable tool for enhancing performance across a wide range of continuous-variable quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fermionic embezzlement of entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement allows to extract arbitrary entangled states from a suitable embezzling state using only local operations while perturbing the resource state arbitrarily little. A natural family of embezzling states is given by ground states of non-interacting, critical fermions in one spatial dimension. This raises the question of whether the embezzlement operations can be restricted to Gaussian operations whenever one only wishes to extract Gaussian entangled states. We show that this is indeed the case and prove that the embezzling property is in fact a generic property of fermionic Gaussian states. Our results provide a fine-grained understanding of embezzlement of entanglement for fermionic Gaussian states in the finite-size regime and thereby bridge finite-size systems to abstract characterizations based on the classification of von Neumann algebras. To prove our results, we establish novel bounds relating the distance of covariances to the trace-distance of Gaussian states, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block-encoding is a standard framework for embedding matrices into unitary operators in quantum algorithms. Efficient implementation of products between block-encoded matrices is crucial for applications such as Hamiltonian simulation and quantum linear algebra. We present resource-efficient methods for matrix-matrix, Kronecker, and Hadamard products between block-encodings that apply to rectangular matrices of arbitrary dimensions. Our constructions significantly reduce the number of ancilla qubits, achieving exponential qubit savings for sequences of matrix-matrix multiplications, with a moderate increase in gate complexity. These product operations also enable more complex block-encodings, including a compression gadget for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation and matrices represented as sums of Kronecker products, each with improved resource requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a century, quantum theorists have been reading the mathematical entrails of quantum mechanics (QM) to divine the nature of quantum reality. But to little avail. In this paper a different approach is taken, namely to identify and explain the basic intuitive ideas involved in QM. This does not tell one how those basic `gears' all mesh together in the beautiful mathematics of QM. But this does give one some intuitive (\textit{anschaulich})) ideas about the quantum reality described in the seemingly hard-to-interpret mathematical framework.</description>

      <title>Single-shot sorting of M\"ossbauer time-domain data at X-ray free electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is widely used to study structure and dynamics of matter with remarkably high energy resolution, provided by the narrow nuclear resonance line widths. However, the narrow width implies low count rates, such that experiments commonly average over extended measurement times or many x-ray pulses (``shots''). This averaging impedes the study of non-equilibrium phenomena. It has been suggested that X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) could enable M\"ossbauer single-shot measurements without averaging, and a proof-of-principle demonstration has been reported. However, so far, only a tiny fraction of all shots resulted in signal-photon numbers which are sufficiently high for a single-shot analysis. Here, we demonstrate coherent nuclear-forward-scattering of self-seeded XFEL radiation, with up to 900 signal-photons per shot. We develop a sorting approach which allows us to include all data on a single-shot level, independent of the signal content of the individual shots. It utilizes the presence of different dynamics classes, i.e. different nuclear evolutions after each excitation. Each shot is assigned to one of the classes, which can then be analyzed separately. Our approach determines the classes from the data without requiring theory modeling nor prior knowledge on the dynamics, making it also applicable to unknown phenomena. We envision that our approach opens up new grounds for M\"ossbauer science, enabling the study of out-of-equilibrium transient dynamics of the nuclei or their environment.</description>

      <title>Empty-Signal Detection: Proof-of-Principle Scheme for Arbitrarily Long-Distance Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure quantum communication, particularly quantum key distribution (QKD), has remained a central research focus for more than four decades and continues to attract significant attention in recent years. However, due to the unavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been constrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced by empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to arbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an empty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers, which integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis into a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information onto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the message-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the auxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify the non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted message. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication processing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty signals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even commercially available, devices, and can be realized under current technological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for achieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy channel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and offers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications can be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Spaces: Replacing Fuzzy Metrics with the Hilbert Space Structure of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy metric spaces, grounded in t-norms and membership functions, have been widely proposed to model uncertainty in machine learning, decision systems, and artificial intelligence. Yet these frameworks treat uncertainty as an external layer of imprecision imposed upon classical, point-like entities - a conceptual mismatch for domains where indeterminacy is intrinsic, such as quantum systems or cognitive representations. We argue that fuzzy metrics are unnecessary for modeling such uncertainty: instead, the well-established structure of complex Hilbert spaces - the foundational language of quantum mechanics for over a century - provides a natural, rigorous, and non-contradictory metric space where the ``points'' are quantum states themselves. The distance between states is given by the Hilbert norm, which directly encodes state distinguishability via the Born rule. This framework inherently captures the non-classical nature of uncertainty without requiring fuzzy logic, t-norms, or membership degrees. We demonstrate its power by modeling AI concepts as Gaussian wavefunctions and classifying ambiguous inputs via quantum overlap integrals. Unlike fuzzy methods, our approach naturally handles interference, distributional shape, and concept compositionality through the geometry of state vectors. We conclude that fuzzy metric spaces, while historically useful, are obsolete for representing intrinsic uncertainty - superseded by the more robust, predictive, and ontologically coherent framework of quantum state geometry.</description>

      <title>Single-Round Deterministic Quantum Anonymous Veto Using Bell States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Anonymous Veto (QAV) protocols enable secure and anonymous decision-making by allowing participants to detect the presence of a veto without revealing individual choices. While existing QAV schemes offer strong theoretical guarantees, they face significant limitations in practical implementation due to resource requirements, scalability issues, and the need for multipartite entanglement. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic QAV protocol that leverages only bipartite entanglement in the form of Bell states and achieves conclusive veto detection in a single round. Our approach eliminates the need for multi-qubit entangled states and iterative rounds, thereby significantly reducing experimental overhead and enhancing scalability. The protocol preserves critical properties such as voter anonymity, correctness, and verifiability, making it well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, we outline a practical photonic realization based on polarization-path encoding and discrete-time quantum walks, demonstrating its feasibility within current quantum optical platforms. This work contributes a resource-efficient and experimentally viable alternative to existing QAV schemes, advancing the prospects of secure quantum decision-making in distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Entanglement's Metrological Power: Empirical Modeling of Optimal States in Quantum Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using extensive numerical analysis of 20,000 randomly generated two-qubit states, we provide a quantitative analysis of the connection between entanglement measures and Maximized Quantum Fisher Information (MQFI). Our systematic study shows strong empirical relationships between the metrological capacity of quantum states and three different entanglement measures: concurrence, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. We show that optimization over local unitary transformations produces substantially more predictable relationships than fixed-generator quantum Fisher information approaches using sophisticated statistical analysis, such as bootstrap resampling, systematic data binning, and multiple model comparisons. With exponential fits reaching $R^2 &gt; 0.99$ and polynomial models reaching $R^2 = 0.999$, we offer thorough empirical support for saturation behavior in quantum metrological advantage. With immediate applications to realworld quantum sensing protocols, our findings directly empirically validate important predictions from quantum resource theory and set fundamental bounds for quantum sensor optimization and resource allocation. These intricate relationships are quantitatively described by the polynomial and exponential fit equations, which offer crucial real-world direction for the design of quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Anomaly Detection for ADS-B Data using Hybrid Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown promising advantages in accelerating processing speed and effectively handling the high dimensionality associated with complex datasets. Quantum Computing (QC) enables more efficient data manipulation through the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. In this paper, we present a novel approach combining quantum and classical machine learning techniques to explore the impact of quantum properties for anomaly detection in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We compare the performance of a Hybrid-Fully Connected Quantum Neural Network (H-FQNN) with different loss functions and use a publicly available ADS-B dataset to evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate competitive performance in detecting anomalies, with accuracies ranging from 90.17% to 94.05%, comparable to the performance of a traditional Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) model, which achieved accuracies between 91.50% and 93.37%.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic-Circuit Qubit Reuse and Grover-Based Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully quantum reinforcement learning framework is developed that integrates a quantum Markov decision process, dynamic circuit-based qubit reuse, and Grover's algorithm for trajectory optimization. The framework encodes states, actions, rewards, and transitions entirely within the quantum domain, enabling parallel exploration of state-action sequences through superposition and eliminating classical subroutines. Dynamic circuit operations, including mid-circuit measurement and reset, allow reuse of the same physical qubits across multiple agent-environment interactions, reducing qubit requirements from 7*T to 7 for T time steps while preserving logical continuity. Quantum arithmetic computes trajectory returns, and Grover's search is applied to the superposition of these evaluated trajectories to amplify the probability of measuring those with the highest return, thereby accelerating the identification of the optimal policy. Simulations demonstrate that the dynamic-circuit-based implementation preserves trajectory fidelity while reducing qubit usage by 66 percent relative to the static design. Experimental deployment on IBM Heron-class quantum hardware confirms that the framework operates within the constraints of current quantum processors and validates the feasibility of fully quantum multi-step reinforcement learning under noisy intermediate-scale quantum conditions. This framework advances the scalability and practical application of quantum reinforcement learning for large-scale sequential decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>AI Methods for Permutation Circuit Synthesis Across Generic Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies for the synthesis and transpilation of permutation circuits across generic topologies. Our approach uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve near-optimal synthesis of permutation circuits up to 25 qubits. Rather than developing specialized models for individual topologies, we train a foundational model on a generic rectangular lattice, and employ masking mechanisms to dynamically select subsets of topologies during the synthesis. This enables the synthesis of permutation circuits on any topology that can be embedded within the rectangular lattice, without the need to re-train the model. In this paper we show results for 5x5 lattice and compare them to previous AI topology-oriented models and classical methods, showing that they outperform classical heuristics, and match previous specialized AI models, and performs synthesis even for topologies that were not seen during training. We further show that the model can be fine tuned to strengthen the performance for selected topologies of interest. This methodology allows a single trained model to efficiently synthesize circuits across diverse topologies, allowing its practical integration into transpilation workflows.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>

      <title>Integrated Telecom Wavelength Heralded Single-Photon Source based on GHz gated detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and flexible concept for a heralded -- spectrally pure -- single photon source. The scheme uses a probabilistic photon pair source pumped with a CW laser, whereby a rapid gating InGaAs/InP single photon avalanche diode provides a synchronous clock and temporally resolves, and hence spectrally filters, the heralded photons. We demonstrate the concept by combining this with a narrow-band integrated silicon nitride photon-pair source. This simple architecture is capable of heralding photons with high spectral purity in the telecom band, but could be adapted to other wavelengths and bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Theory of Multi-photon Processes for Applications in Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for evaluating multi-photon processes in periodically driven quantum systems, which have been identified as a versatile tool for engineering and controlling nontrivial interactions in various quantum technology platforms. To achieve the accuracy required for such applications, the resulting effective coupling rates, as well as any drive-induced frequency shifts, must be determined with very high precision. Here, we employ degenerate Floquet perturbation theory together with a diagrammatic representation of multi-photon processes to develop a systematic and automatable approach for evaluating the effective dynamics of driven quantum systems to arbitrary orders in the drive strength. As a specific example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to the study of multi-photon Rabi oscillations in a superconducting fluxonium qubit, finding excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and exact numerical simulations, even in parameter regimes where previously known methods are no longer applicable.</description>

      <title>Effects of time dependence in the second order coherence of pulsed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For light in a single temporal mode, the time dependence is associated entirely with the deterministic pulse shape rather than the quantum state. This means the second order coherence of light can no longer be understood as the temporal distribution of photons. We calculate the distribution of photon arrival time differences for pulsed light and find that it is inherently strongly bunched in terms of photocount arrival time differences. We further show how to account for the pulse shape when determining the second order coherence that characterizes quantum states.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts due to relativistic effects and retardation in continuous variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based quantum communication naturally involves satellites and ground stations exchanging optical signals at high altitudes and large relative velocities. Starting from general relativistic considerations, we systematically separate the frequency shift into longitudinal Doppler contributions, relativistic corrections, and corrections from the propagation delay (retardation). We find the relativistic corrections to the Keplerian satellite orbits to be negligible on the considered timescale, compared to the gravitational and special relativistic time dilation contributions to the frequency shift. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the contribution from the retardation effect to be on the same order of magnitude as the relativistic contributions. To analyze the significance of these effects, we investigate secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol for various configurations of satellite orbits and ground stations. We find that the corrections from relativistic effects and retardation significantly impact the communication performance and should be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Sequential analysis in a continuous spin-noise quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many control and detection applications require real-time analysis of signals from sensors, in order to quickly and accurately act upon events revealed by the sensors. Such signal analysis benefits from statistical models of signal and sensor behavior. This creates a need for data analysis methods that are simultaneously model-based, computationally efficient and causal, in the sense that they employ only sensor data available prior to a specific point in time. In this work, we implement sequential data analysis techniques on a spin-noise-based quantum sensor, to perform two key tasks: hypothesis testing and quickest change-point detection. These online protocols allow us to detect weak magnetic fields by adaptively collecting measurement data until a predefined confidence threshold is reached. We demonstrate these methods in a realistic experimental setting and derive performance bounds for the achievable precision and response time. Our approach has potential utility when detecting small perturbations to the magnetic field, in both applied and fundamental contexts including biomagnetism, geophysical surveys, detection of concealed materials, searches for dark matter candidates and exotic spin interactions. Our results demonstrate that sequential techniques enable faster and more sensitive detection, making them a powerful tool for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoders: Learning latent representations for quantum data generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a quantum model for generation of quantum data. The QGAA consists of two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and (b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities. The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a) generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13301v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a driven-dissipative system consisting of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensates loaded into a two-dimensional Hubbard lattice and coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity. Due to the interplay between strong, repulsive atomic interaction and the atom-cavity coupling, the system exhibits several phases of atoms and photons including the atomic superfluid (SF) and supersolid (SS). We investigate the dynamical behaviour of the system, where we include dissipation by means of Lindblad master equation formalism. Due to the discontinuous nature of the Dicke transition for strong atomic repulsion, we find extended co-existence region of different phases. We investigate the resulting switching dynamics, particularly between the coexisting SF and SS phases, which eventually becomes damped by the dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high-energy electron-positron annihilation are promising systems for the study of quantum information properties. In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Learning and Optimization methods for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a fundamental NP-hard problem in logistics. Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM) for solving CVRP performance depends heavily on well-tuned penalty parameters. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization approach that integrates deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the selection of penalty parameter values within both classical (RL-C-ALM) and quantum-enhanced (RL-Q-ALM) ALM solvers. Using Soft Actor-Critic, our approach learns penalty values from CVRP instance features and constraint violations. In RL-Q-ALM, subproblems are encoded as QUBOs and solved using Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE). The agent learns across episodes by maximizing solution feasibility and minimizing cost. Experiments show that RL-C-ALM outperforms manually tuned ALM on synthetic and benchmark CVRP instances, achieving better solutions with fewer iterations. Also, RL-Q-ALM matches classical solution quality on small instances but incurs higher runtimes due to quantum overhead. Our results highlight the potential of combining RL with classical and quantum solvers for scalable, adaptive combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes with non-local surface conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new framework that can be utilized for the electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with non-local surface conductivity (spatial dispersion) is presented. The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the Kubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the effective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT surface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an infinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to nonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local conductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the correct formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which are manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary conditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the exact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the Wiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of the EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a numerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its approximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing in the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved and analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the optical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for the design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out some future directions, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: a non-perturbative resolution to the negativity of bulk entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and R\'enyi entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\'enyi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.</description>

Abstract: A generalization of the coadjoint orbit action describes the dynamics of an observer (or instrument). We consider how this fits in with the view of observables in field theory being correlations of read-outs of instruments and show how one recovers the usual $S$-matrix formulae. A simple resolution of the Fermi paradox is also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian truncation and quantum simulation of strong-field QED beyond tree level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</description>

      <title>Formation of Cavity-Polaritons via High-Order Van Hove Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polaritons formed by hybridizing particle-hole excitations of an insulating phase with a cavity photon at sub-gap frequencies, where absorption is suppressed. The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove singularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more a photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the singularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose to engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in order to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS. Ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer two-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap. Moreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms prevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state systems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our findings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for polariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments have shown that strong coupling between molecular excitations and a mode of a Fabry--P\'erot cavity can significantly alter molecular properties, such as reaction rates and equilibrium constants. However, in spite of the large body of theoretical work, the mechanism behind this change is still not well understood. In order to make progress, we first take a step back and question the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian that most recent studies are based on. In particular, we investigate the dipole self-energy cross terms, which have received attention as they seem to mediate distance-independent interactions between all molecules in the cavity. However, it is often overlooked that these terms are known to cancel exactly with the intermolecular Coulombic interactions -- which on the other hand are usually neglected. In this work, we revisit how this cancellation comes about in free space and in a perfect cavity, and we discuss how the situation changes for a more realistic cavity in the framework of macroscopic QED. Finally, we discuss the implications of this cancellation for the single-mode Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A State-Specific Iterative Decoupling Scheme Based on Perturbation Theory for Low-Energy Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states, significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4 molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and improving a classical Betti number estimation algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a classical algorithm for estimating the normalized Betti number of an arbitrary simplicial complex was proposed. Motivated by a quantum algorithm with a similar Monte Carlo structure and improved sample complexity, we give a more in-depth analysis of the sample complexity of this classical algorithm. To this end, we present bounds for the variance of the estimators used in the classical algorithm and show that the variance depends on certain combinatorial properties of the underlying simplicial complex. This new analysis leads us to propose an improvement to the classical algorithm which makes the "easy cases easier'', in that it reduces the sample complexity for simplicial complexes where the variance is sufficiently small. We show the effectiveness and limitations of these classical algorithms by considering Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graph models to demonstrate the existence of "easy" and "hard" cases. Namely, we show that for certain models our improvement almost always leads to a reduced sample complexity, and also produce separate regimes where the sample complexity for both algorithms is exponential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity -- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Exploring confinement transitions in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories with dipolar atoms beyond one dimension</title>

Abstract: Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation scaling in parameterised quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the backpropagation algorithm ranks among one of the most important moments in the history of machine learning, and has made possible the training of large-scale neural networks through its ability to compute gradients at roughly the same computational cost as model evaluation. Despite its importance, a similar backpropagation-like scaling for gradient evaluation of parameterised quantum circuits has remained elusive. Currently, the most popular method requires sampling from a number of circuits that scales with the number of circuit parameters, making training of large-scale quantum circuits prohibitively expensive in practice. Here we address this problem by introducing a class of structured circuits that are not known to be classically simulable and admit gradient estimation with significantly fewer circuits. In the simplest case -- for which the parameters feed into commuting quantum gates -- these circuits allow for fast estimation of the gradient, higher order partial derivatives and the Fisher information matrix. Moreover, specific families of parameterised circuits exist for which the scaling of gradient estimation is in line with classical backpropagation, and can thus be trained at scale. In a toy classification problem on 16 qubits, such circuits show competitive performance with other methods, while reducing the training cost by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold promise for solving problems intractable for classical computers, especially those with high time or space complexity. Practical quantum advantage can be said to exist for such problems when the end-to-end time for solving such a problem using a classical algorithm exceeds that required by a quantum algorithm. Reducing the power flow (PF) problem into a linear system of equations allows for the formulation of quantum PF (QPF) algorithms, which are based on solving methods for quantum linear systems such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm. Speedup from using QPF algorithms is often claimed to be exponential when compared to classical PF solved by state-of-the-art algorithms. We investigate the potential for practical quantum advantage in solving QPF compared to classical methods on gate-based quantum computers. Notably, this paper does not present a new QPF solving algorithm but scrutinizes the end-to-end complexity of the QPF approach, providing a nuanced evaluation of the purported quantum speedup in this problem. Our analysis establishes a best-case bound for the HHL-based quantum power flow complexity, conclusively demonstrating that the HHL-based method has higher runtime complexity compared to the classical algorithm for solving the direct current power flow (DCPF) and fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) problem. Notably, our analysis and conclusions can be extended to any quantum linear system solver with rigorous performance guarantees, based on the known complexity lower bounds for this problem. Additionally, we establish that for potential practical quantum advantage (PQA) to exist it is necessary to consider DCPF-type problems with a very narrow range of condition number values and readout requirements.</description>

Abstract: We prove that adaptive strategies offer no advantage over non-adaptive ones for learning and testing Pauli channels using entangled inputs. This key observation allows us to characterize the query complexity for several fundamental tasks by translating optimal classical estimation algorithms into the quantum setting. First, we determine the tight query complexity for learning a Pauli channel under the general $\ell_p$ norm, providing results that improve upon or match the best-known bounds for the $\ell_1, \ell_2,$ and $\ell_\infty$ distances. Second, we resolve the complexity of testing whether a Pauli channel is a white noise source. Finally, we show that the optimal query complexities for estimating the Shannon entropy and support size of the channel's error distribution, and for estimating the diamond distance between two Pauli channels, are all $\Theta\left(\tfrac{4^n}{n\epsilon^2}\right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-platform verification is the task of comparing the output states produced by different physical platforms using solely local quantum operations and classical communication. While protocols have previously been suggested for this task, their exponential sample complexity renders them unpractical even for intermediate-scale quantum systems. In this work, we propose a novel protocol for this task based on Pauli sampling, a subroutine which generates Paulis distributed according to their weight in the expansion of a quantum state in the Pauli basis. We show that our protocols for both Pauli sampling and cross-platform verification are efficient for pure states with low magic and entanglement (i.e., of the order $O(\log n)$). Conversely, we show super-polynomial lower bounds on the complexity of both tasks for states with $\omega(\log n)$ magic and entanglement. Interestingly, when considering states with real amplitudes the requirements of our protocol for cross-platform verification can be significantly weakened.</description>

Abstract: Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Routing and wavelength assignment in quantum key distribution networks: power control heuristics for quantum-classical multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution networks grow in size and complexity, resource assignment has become increasingly important. In passive optical networks without wavelength conversion, we need to assign a full route between origin and destination with the same wavelength from a finite set. This problem is computationally intensive and the common solution in classical optical networks is using heuristics. We adapt these heuristics to hybrid quantum networks where the quantum channel can share some of the optical links with classical channels. In this quantum-classical multiplexing, nonlinear effects can become the limiting factor in the range of the network. The signal in the classical channels can be subject to Raman Scattering or Four-Wave-Mixing and produce light in the quantum channels. While these processes are not efficient, even a single photon can ruin the quantum channel. We propose heuristics for the routing and wavelength assignment problem for hybrid quantum-classical networks with power control for the classical channels. By keeping the transmitted power to its bare functional minimum, we can reduce the interference to the quantum channels. We study their efficiency under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quasiparticles in Superconducting Circuits: Energy Relaxation, Charge and Flux Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21177v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticle density observed in low-temperature superconducting circuits is several orders of magnitude larger than the value expected at thermal equilibrium. The tunneling of this excess of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions is recognized as one of the main loss and decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Here, we present a unified impedance theory that accounts for quasiparticle energy loss in circuit regions both far and near (across) junctions. Our theory leverages the recent experimental demonstration that the excess quasiparticles are in \emph{quasiequilibrium} [T. Connolly et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{132}$, 217001 (2024)] and uses a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to predict the amount of charge and flux noise generated by them. We compute the resulting energy relaxation time $T_1$ in transmon qubits with and without junction asymmetric gap engineering, and show that quasiparticles residing away from junctions can play a dominant role in the former case. They also may provide an upper limit for resonator quality factors if the density of amorphous two-level systems is reduced. In addition, we show that charge noise from quasiparticles leads to flux noise that is logarithmic-in-frequency, giving rise to a ``nearly white" contribution that is comparable to the flux noise observed in flux qubits. This contrasts with amorphous two-level systems, whose associated flux noise is shown to be superOhmic. We discuss how this quasiparticle flux noise can limit $T_2^{*}$ coherence times in flux-tunable qubits. The conclusion is that asymmetric gap engineering can greatly reduce noise and increase coherence times in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning for Linear Properties of Bounded-Gate Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast and complicated large-qubit state space forbids us to comprehensively capture the dynamics of modern quantum computers via classical simulations or quantum tomography. Recent progress in quantum learning theory prompts a crucial question: can linear properties of a large-qubit circuit with d tunable RZ gates and G-d Clifford gates be efficiently learned from measurement data generated by varying classical inputs? In this work, we prove that the sample complexity scaling linearly in $d$ is required to achieve a small prediction error, while the corresponding computational complexity may scale exponentially in d. To address this challenge, we propose a kernel-based method leveraging classical shadows and truncated trigonometric expansions, enabling a controllable trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational overhead. Our results advance two crucial realms in quantum computation: the exploration of quantum algorithms with practical utilities and learning-based quantum system certification. We conduct numerical simulations to validate our proposals across diverse scenarios, encompassing quantum information processing protocols, Hamiltonian simulation, and variational quantum algorithms up to 60 qubits.</description>

      <title>Classical Algorithms for Hamiltonian Dynamics Mean Value and Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of quantum dynamics and ground states is a central challenge in physics and a key frontier for quantum advantage. While short-time evolution in one-dimensional systems can often be simulated classically, extending this to higher dimensions remains difficult. Here, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm for simulating the short-time dynamics of arbitrary local quantum systems. For any local Hamiltonian $H$ and constant evolution time $t$, our method estimates expectation values of the form $\langle\psi|e^{iHt}Oe^{-iHt}|\psi\rangle$ for global Pauli observables $O$ and stabilizer states $|\psi\rangle$, with high precision and exponentially small failure probability. Furthermore, we present a classical dequantization of a tailored quantum algorithm that efficiently solves the guided local Hamiltonian (GLH) problem to constant additive error - previously considered classically hard and hence a promising candidate for quantum computational advantage. These results reveal unexpected classical tractability in constant-time quantum dynamics and fundamental connections between Hamiltonian dynamics mean value and the GLH problem. Our work refines the boundary between classical and quantum computational power, identifying sharper criteria for regimes where quantum advantage may genuinely emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify regimes where post-selection can be used scalably in quantum error correction (QEC) to improve performance. We use statistical mechanical models to analytically quantify the performance and thresholds of post-selected QEC, with a focus on the surface code. Based on the non-equilibrium magnetization of these models, we identify a simple heuristic technique for post-selection that does not require a decoder. Along with performance gains, this heuristic allows us to derive analytic expressions for post-selected conditional logical thresholds and abort thresholds of surface codes. We find that such post-selected QEC is characterised by four distinct thermodynamic phases, and detail the implications of this phase space for practical, scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining low-energy eigenstates in electronic many-body quantum systems is a key challenge in computational chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Hybrid quantum-classical approaches, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Subspace Methods, offer practical solutions but face limitations in circuit depth and measurement overhead. In this article, we propose a variational strategy based on symmetry-preserving cost functions to iteratively construct a reduced subspace for the extraction of low-lying energy states. We show that, under certain conditions, our approach leads to a tridiagonal representation similar to that obtained with the Lanczos algorithm. The iterative process allows control over the trade-off between circuit depth, the number of variational parameters, and the number of measurements required to achieve the desired accuracy, making it suitable for current quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we test the proposed algorithms on H4 chain and ring, targeting both the ground-state energy and the charge gap.</description>

      <title>Towards Supporting QIR: Steps for Adopting the Quantum Intermediate Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate representations (IRs) play a crucial role in the software stack of a quantum computer to facilitate efficient optimizations for executing an application on hardware. One of those IRs is the Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), which builds on the classical LLVM compiler infrastructure. In this article, we outline different approaches to how QIR can be adopted. This exploration culminates in a demonstration of what it takes to turn an existing quantum circuit simulator into a QIR runtime and that such a transition is less daunting than it might seem at first. We further show that switching to QIR does not entail any performance deficits compared to the original simulator. On the contrary, the presented steps effortlessly allow adding support for arbitrary classical control flow to any classical simulator. We conclude with an outlook on future directions using QIR. The implemented QIR runtime is available under https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum error correction protocols for neutral atoms quantum processors in the presence of atom loss. We complement the surface code with loss detection units (LDU) and analyze its performances by means of circuit-level simulations for two distinct protocols -- the standard LDU and a teleportation-based LDU --, focussing on the impact of both atom loss and depolarizing noise on the logical error probability. We introduce and employ a new adaptive decoding procedure that leverages the knowledge of loss locations provided by the LDUs, improving logical error probabilities by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to a naive decoder. For the considered error models, our results demonstrate the existence of an error threshold line that depends linearly on the probabilities of atom loss and of depolarizing errors. For zero depolarizing noise, the atom loss threshold is about $2.6\%$.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and nonstabilizerness, or ``magic'', offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic resources under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings. Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and magic saturation at time scales logarithmic in system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and stabilizer entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of conservation laws in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <title>All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination: Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Which quantum phenomena are advantageous for information processing tasks? By classifying quantum states as resourceful versus non-resourceful, or free, the mathematical formalism of quantum resource theories helps to address such questions. For the task of discriminating channels applied to a probe state, it has been shown that under certain conditions -- namely, the set of free states being convex or finite dimensional -- every resourceful probe state can provide an advantage, quantified by a resource monotone known as generalized robustness. In this work, bypassing the limitations of previous studies, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory and show that it admits two operational interpretations. Firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in channel discrimination tasks implemented on multiple copies of the probe states. Secondly, in many physically relevant theories, it quantifies the advantage in single-copy channel discrimination tasks in a worst case scenario. We further present a general construction of multi-copy resource witnesses and provide practical methods to bound the generalized robustness in experiments. Finally, we apply our results to a key case study in continuous variable quantum information: the resource theory of non-Gaussianity. This theory is naturally defined by a set of free states (Gaussian states) that is non-convex and infinite-dimensional. Our work then shows conclusively that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states and are typically disregarded for other quantum information tasks. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: We study the interaction of two massive particles with a quantised gravitational field in its vacuum state using two different position observables: (i) a frame-dependent coordinate separation and (ii) a frame-independent geodesic separation. For free particles, (i) leads to purely unitary dynamics but (ii) leads to dissipation. For two particles coupled through a linear spring, (i) and (ii) lead to different cut-off dependences in the frequency shift harmonic ladder of the differential motional mode. Our findings highlight the subtle consequences of different position observables at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of the phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (PM-MDI QKD) protocol proposed by Lin and L\"utkenhaus for satellite-based quantum communication. The protocol's key rate, known to exceed the repeaterless bound, is evaluated in the asymptotic limit under noisy conditions typical of satellite communications, including loss-only scenarios. The setup involves two ground-based parties connected via fiber (lossonly or noisy) and a space-based third party linked to one of these two ground-based parties through free-space communication. Simulations using the elliptic-beam approximation model the average key rate (AKR) and its probability distribution (PDR) across varying zenith angles and fiber distances. Down-link free-space communication is assessed under day and night conditions, with intensity optimization for each graphical point. Dynamic configurations of satellite and ground stations are also considered. Results indicate that AKR decays more slowly under loss-only conditions, while PDR analysis shows higher key rates produce more concentrated distributions. These findings demonstrate the potential of PM-MDI QKD protocols for achieving reliable key rates in satellitebased quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double descent phenomenon challenges traditional statistical learning theory by revealing scenarios where larger models do not necessarily lead to reduced performance on unseen data. While this counterintuitive behavior has been observed in a variety of classical machine learning models, particularly modern neural network architectures, it remains elusive within the context of quantum machine learning. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that linear regression models in quantum feature spaces can exhibit double descent behavior by drawing on insights from classical linear regression and random matrix theory. Additionally, our numerical experiments on quantum kernel methods across different real-world datasets and system sizes further confirm the existence of a test error peak, a characteristic feature of double descent. Our findings provide evidence that quantum models can operate in the modern, overparameterized regime without experiencing overfitting, potentially opening pathways to improved learning performance beyond traditional statistical learning theory.</description>

      <title>On the role of symmetry and geometry in global quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum implementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the algorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes. These methods are expected to be applicable to a broader class of open quantum systems beyond the specific models considered in this study.</description>

Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the \emph{belief propagation (BP) channel}, namely a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map that realizes local perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we prove that establishing the quasi-locality of BP channels implies the decay of CMI, thereby reducing the original conjecture to a more tractable problem. We show that such quasi-local BP channels can be constructed under natural physical conditions, such as uniform rapid mixing or uniform clustering. Under these assumptions, we obtain conditional proofs of CMI decay valid at all temperatures. Moreover, because these assumptions are automatically satisfied at high temperatures, our results in that regime yield unconditional proofs of CMI decay. At the same time, in order to better understand the high-temperature behavior of Gibbs states, we revisit the cluster expansion method. Contrary to common intuition, we demonstrate that when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered, the cluster expansion suffers from intrinsic divergence problems rooted in the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula, revealing fundamental limitations of this traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>From top quarks to enhanced quantum key distribution: A Framework for Optimal Predictability of Quantum Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid discrimination strategy in quantum communication based on photon-number-resolving detectors and mesoscopic twin-beam states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State discrimination is a key challenge in the implementation of quantum communication protocols. Most optical communication protocols rely on either coherent states of light or fragile single-photon states, making it often difficult to achieve robustness and security simultaneously. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy that operates in the mesoscopic intensity regime, leveraging robust quantum states of light. Our approach combines classical and quantum features: reliable state discrimination based on a classical property of light, and security stemming from nonclassical correlations. Specifically, the receiver uses photon-number-resolving detectors to access the mean photon number of the binary thermal signals encoding the information. The communication channel exploits twin-beam states, inherently sensitive to eavesdropping attacks, to provide a layer of security. This strategy is scalable, allowing for straightforward extension to more complex signal alphabets, and offers a promising route for robust and secure quantum communication in the mesoscopic intensity domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study monitored quantum dynamics of infinite-range interacting bosonic systems in the thermodynamic limit. We show that under semiclassical assumptions, the quantum fluctuations along single monitored trajectories adopt a deterministic limit for both quantum-jump and state-diffusion unravelings, and they can be exactly solved. In particular, the hierarchical structure of the equations of motion explains the coincidence of entanglement criticalities and dissipative phase transitions found in previous finite-size numerical studies. We illustrate the findings on a Bose-Hubbard dimer and a collective spin system.</description>

      <title>Secure Hybrid Key Growing via Coherence Witnessing and Bipartite Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel Hybrid Key Growing (HKG) protocol based on quantum principles and a classical physical-layer assumption. We simultaneously exploit the quantum photon-number and photon-time-bin Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), effectively doubling the bit-per-pulse rate compared to conventional Quantum Key Growing (QKG) schemes. Our protocol integrates entity authentication, and is designed for practical implementation by avoiding reliance on single-photon sources or detectors. By incorporating prior knowledge about the quantum channel, the scheme actively mitigates noise effects, making it suitable for real-world conditions. Under certain assumptions on experimental efficiencies, our approach also promises an increased key generation rate in bits per second. Our simulation results display, first, expected outcomes to gain assurance about the correctness of our implementation and, second, relevant dependencies that showcase desirable properties of our scheme in regimes of low photon loss and dephasing. In particular, within such regimes, our encoding scheme reduces the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) while preserving the ability to detect eavesdropping and identity-forgery attempts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Control Hierarchy: When Physics-Informed Design Meets Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a wide spectrum of quantum control strategies, including various open-loop protocols and advanced adaptive methods. These methodologies apply to few-qubit scenarios and naturally scale to larger N-qubit systems. We benchmark them across fundamental quantum tasks: entanglement preservation/generation, and directed quantum transport in a disordered quantum walk. All simulations are performed in a challenging environment featuring non-Markov colored noise, imperfections, and the Markov Lindblad equation. With a complex task-dependent performance hierarchy, our deterministic protocols proved highly effective for entanglement generation/preservation, and in specific pulse configurations, they even outperformed the RL-optimization. In contrast, more advanced methods demonstrate a marked specialization. For entanglement preservation, a physics-informed hybrid Quantum Error Correction and Dynamical Decoupling (QEC-DD) protocol provides the most stable and effective solution, outperforming all other approaches. Conversely, for dynamic tasks requiring the discovery of non-trivial control sequences, such as DD, Floquet engineering, and rapid entanglement generation or coherent transport, the model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents consistently find superior solutions. We further demonstrate that the control pulse envelope is a non-trivial factor that actively shapes the control landscape, which determines the difficulty for all protocols and highlights the adaptability of the RL agent. We conclude that no single strategy is universally dominant. A clear picture emerges: the future of high-fidelity quantum control lies in a synthesis of physics-informed design, as exemplified by robust hybrid methods, and the specialized, high-performance optimization power of adaptive machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Superdense coding has long been regarded as a secure quantum communication protocol. It is natural to assume that employing logical quantum states with error-correcting capability would not compromise this security. However, in the context of GKP-based quantum communication, we propose a vulnerability that we term quantum keystroke logging. Specifically, consider a large organization that prepares and transmits logical Bell states without ever assembling the full encoded Bell state. Even under this restriction, the organization can still extract the input information without detection, thereby realizing a form of quantum keystroke logging.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Topological Aspects of Dirac Fermions in a Kagom\'e Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dirac fermion with linear dispersion in the kagom\'e lattice governs the low-energy physics of different valleys at two inequivalent corners of hexagonal Brillouin zone. The effective Hamiltonian based on the cyclic permutation symmetry of sublattices is constructed to show that the topology of Dirac fermions at these two valleys is characterized by opposite winding numbers. For spinless fermions, the many-particle interactions produce intervalley scattering and drive an intervalley coherent state with spontaneous translation symmetry breaking. The Dirac fermions acquire a mass term from the simultaneous charge and bond orderings. In this phase, the developed bond texture underlies a hollow-star-of-David pattern in a tripled Wigner-Seitz cell of kagom\'e lattice. It is further demonstrated that the twisting of Dirac mass with vorticity leads to zero Dirac modes at the vortex core, which are intimately related to fractionalization. The hollow-star-of-David phase is shown to have a distinct $\mathbb{Z}_6$ Berry phase with its sign-change counterpart of Dirac mass, i.e. the hexagonal phase, shedding light on the topological origin of zero Dirac modes around the vortex core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known "charge-fuzzy phase" for weakly monitored diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, the fluctuations in their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Schottky anomaly in a cavity-coupled double quantum well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gas confined in a double quantum well that is coupled to a uniform quasi-static cavity mode via fluctuations of the dipole moment. We focus on the regime of large number of electrons participating in the virtual inter-subband transitions. In this regime, the effective photonic potential is no longer quadratic but, instead, it contains large number of minima. Each minimum represents a nearly harmonic oscillator with the renormalized cavity frequency that is much greater than its bare value. The energy offset of a minimum scales quadratically with respect to the photon coordinate corresponding to this minimum. These energy offsets determine the statistical weight of each minimum, and altogether they result in the additive correction to the heat capacity of the system. This correction exhibits a Schottky anomaly and a 0.5k_B plateau at low temperatures. This behavior can be associated with the emergence of a new degree of freedom. This degree of freedom does not manifest in the optical conductivity and can only be observed via the heat capacity measurement.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches with long range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although R\'enyi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.</description>
