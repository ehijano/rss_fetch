      <title>Fast Texture Transfer for XR Avatars via Barycentric UV Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and efficient method for transferring facial textures onto SMPL-X-based full-body avatars. Unlike conventional affine-transform methods that are slow and prone to visual artifacts, our method utilizes a barycentric UV conversion technique. Our approach precomputes the entire UV mapping into a single transformation matrix, enabling texture transfer in a single operation. This results in a speedup of over 7000x compared to the baseline, while also significantly improving the final texture quality by eliminating boundary artifacts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our method offers a practical solution for personalization in immersive XR applications. The code is available online.</description>

      <title>A Technical Review on Comparison and Estimation of Steganographic Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steganography is technique of hiding a data under cover media using different steganography tools. Image steganography is hiding of data (Text/Image/Audio/Video) under a cover as Image. This review paper presents classification of image steganography and the comparison of various Image steganography tools using different image formats. Analyzing numerous tools on the basis of Image features and extracting the best one. Some of the tools available in the market were selected based on the frequent use; these tools were tested using the same input on all of them. Specific text was embedded within all host images for each of the six Steganography tools selected. The results of the experiment reveal that all the six tools were relatively performing at the same level, though some software performs better than others through efficiency. And it was based on the image features like size, dimensions, and pixel value and histogram differentiation.</description>

      <title>Seam360GS: Seamless 360{\deg} Gaussian Splatting from Real-World Omnidirectional Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 360-degree visual content is widely shared on platforms such as YouTube and plays a central role in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, consumer-grade dual-fisheye systems consistently yield imperfect panoramas due to inherent lens separation and angular distortions. In this work, we introduce a novel calibration framework that incorporates a dual-fisheye camera model into the 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline. Our approach not only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye cameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree images. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration variables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework transforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces seamless renderings-even from imperfect images-and outperforms existing 360-degree rendering models.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Space Super-Resolution Network for Rendering Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on neural upscaling frameworks, we introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low-frequency and high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by 1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, with only a modest relative runtime overhead. Taken together, our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations a principled path toward higher-quality super-resolution in graphics applications.</description>

      <title>DiffArtist: Towards Structure and Appearance Controllable Image Stylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artistic styles are defined by both their structural and appearance elements. Existing neural stylization techniques primarily focus on transferring appearance-level features such as color and texture, often neglecting the equally crucial aspect of structural stylization. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{DiffArtist}, the first 2D stylization method to offer fine-grained, simultaneous control over both structure and appearance style strength. This dual controllability is achieved by representing structure and appearance generation as separate diffusion processes, necessitating no further tuning or additional adapters. To properly evaluate this new capability of dual stylization, we further propose a Multimodal LLM-based stylization evaluator that aligns significantly better with human preferences than existing metrics. Extensive analysis shows that DiffArtist achieves superior style fidelity and dual-controllability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Its text-driven, training-free design and unprecedented dual controllability make it a powerful and interactive tool for various creative applications.

      <title>UltraRay: Introducing Full-Path Ray Tracing in Physics-Based Ultrasound Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulators solve the wave equation to model pressure distribution fields, achieving high accuracy but requiring significant computational time and resources. To address this, ray tracing approaches have been introduced, modeling wave propagation as rays interacting with boundaries and scatterers. However, existing models simplify ray propagation, generating echoes at interaction points without considering return paths to the sensor. This can result in unrealistic artifacts and necessitates careful scene tuning for plausible results. We propose a novel ultrasound simulation pipeline that utilizes a ray tracing algorithm to generate echo data, tracing each ray from the transducer through the scene and back to the sensor. To replicate advanced ultrasound imaging, we introduce a ray emission scheme optimized for plane wave imaging, incorporating delay and steering capabilities. Furthermore, we integrate a standard signal processing pipeline to simulate end-to-end ultrasound image formation. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed pipeline by modeling synthetic scenes featuring highly reflective objects, such as bones. In doing so, our proposed approach, UltraRay, not only enhances the overall visual quality but also improves the realism of the simulated images by accurately capturing secondary reflections and reducing unnatural artifacts. By building on top of a differentiable framework, the proposed pipeline lays the groundwork for a fast and differentiable ultrasound simulation tool necessary for gradient-based optimization, enabling advanced ultrasound beamforming strategies, neural network integration, and accurate inverse scene reconstruction.</description>

      <title>PediatricsMQA: a Multi-modal Pediatrics Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care.</description>
