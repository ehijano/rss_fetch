      <title>Coupling of forward-backward stochastic differential equations on the Wiener space, and application on regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. Geiss and J. Ylinen proposed the coupling method \cite{Geiss:Ylinen:21} to investigate the regularity for the solution to the backward stochastic differential equations with random coefficients. In this paper, we explore this method in setting for the forward-backward stochastic differential equation with random and Lipschitz coefficients, We obtain the regularity in time, and the Malliavin Sobolev ${\mathbb D}_{1,2}$ differentiability for the solution.</description>

      <title>Clustering of large deviations events in heavy-tailed moving average processes: the catastrophe principle in the short-memory case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do large deviation events in a stationary process cluster? The answer depends not only on the type of large deviations, but also on the length of memory in the process. Somewhat unexpectedly, it may also depend on the tails of the process. In this paper we work in the context of large deviations for partial sums in moving average processes with short memory and regularly varying tails. We show that the structure of the large deviation cluster in this case markedly differs from the corresponding structure in the case of exponentially light tails, considered in Chakrabarty and Samorodnitsky (2024). This is due to the difference between the ``conspiracy'' vs. the ``catastrophe'' principles underlying the large deviation events in the light tailed case and the heavy tailed case, correspondingly.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviors of fractional binomial distributions derived from the generalized binomial theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fractional binomial distribution, introduced by Hino and Namba (2024) via the generalized binomial theorem, is a fractional variant of the classical binomial distribution. Building upon previous work that established limit theorems, such as the weak law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, for fractional binomial distributions, this paper further investigates their asymptotic behaviors. Specifically, we derive the large and moderate deviation principles and a Berry--Esseen type estimate for these distributions.</description>

      <title>Hitting Probabilities and the Ekstr{\"o}m-Persson conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ekst\''om-Persson conjecture concerning the value of the Hausdorff dimension of random covering sets formed by balls with radii $(k^{-\alpha})_{k=1}^\infty$ and centres chosen independently at random according to an arbitrary Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The conjecture has been solved positively in the case $\frac 1\alpha\le \overline{\dim}_H \mu$, where $\overline{\dim}_H \mu$ stands for the upper Hausdorff dimension of $\mu$. In this paper, we develop a new approach in order to answer the full conjecture, proving in particular that the conjectured value is only a lower bound for the dimension. Our approach opens the way to study more general limsup sets, and has consequences on the so-called hitting probability questions. For instance, we are able to determine whether and what part of a deterministic analytic set can be hit by random covering sets formed by open sets.</description>

      <title>Construction of ergodic IDLA forests in $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of infinite-volume IDLA forests in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ , with $d \geq 2$, based on a multi-source IDLA protocol. Unlike IDLA aggregates, the laws of the IDLA forests studied here depend on the trajectories of particles, and then do not satisfy the famous Abelian property. Their existence is due to a stabilization result (Theorem 1.1, our main result) that we establish using percolation tools. Although the sources are infinitely many, we also prove that each of them play the same role in the building procedure, which results in an ergodicity property for the IDLA forests (Theorem 1.2).</description>

      <title>Geometric Jensen-Shannon Divergence Between Gaussian Measures On Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence, based on the notion of geometric mean of probability measures, in the setting of Gaussian measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. On the set of all Gaussian measures equivalent to a fixed one, we present a closed form expression for this divergence that directly generalizes the finite-dimensional version. Using the notion of Log-Determinant divergences between positive definite unitized trace class operators, we then define a Regularized Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence that is valid for any pair of Gaussian measures and that recovers the exact Geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence between two equivalent Gaussian measures when the regularization parameter tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and dimension for the geodesic of the critical long-range percolation metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By recent works of B\"aumler [2] and of the authors of this paper [5], the (limiting) random metric for the critical long-range percolation was constructed. In this paper, we prove the uniqueness of the geodesic between two fixed points, for which an important ingredient of independent interest is the continuity of the metric distribution. In addition, we establish the Hausdorff dimension of the geodesics.</description>

      <title>On the Law of the Iterated Logarithm for m-dependent stationary random variables under sub-linear expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for $m$-dependent sequences under the framework of sub-linear expectations. We first extend existing LIL results to sequences of independent, non-identically distributed random variables under sub-linear expectations. This extension serves as a crucial intermediary step, facilitating the subsequent establishment of the LIL for $m$-dependent stationary sequences. On the other hand, we also establish necessary conditions for $m$-dependent sequences in sub-linear expectation spaces.</description>

      <title>Polynomial slowdown in space-inhomogeneous branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a branching Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which particles independently diffuse as standard Brownian motions and branch at an inhomogeneous rate $b(\theta)$ which depends only on the angle $\theta$ of the particle. We assume that $b$ is maximal when $\theta=0$, which is the preferred direction for breeding. Furthermore we assume that $b(\theta ) = 1 - \beta \abs{\theta }^\alpha + O(\theta ^2)$, as $\theta \to 0$, for $\alpha \in (2/3,2)$ and $\beta&gt;0.$ We show that if $M_t$ is the maximum distance to the origin at time $t$, then $(M_t-m(t))_{t\ge 1}$ is tight where $$m(t) = \sqrt{2} t - \frac{\vartheta_1}{\sqrt{2}} t^{(2-\alpha)/(2+\alpha)} - \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} - \frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{2}(2+\alpha)}\right) \log t. $$ and $\vartheta_1$ is explicit in terms of the first eigenvalue of a certain operator.</description>

      <title>Detecting transitions from steady states to chaos with gamma distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method to identify transitions from steady states to chaos in stochastic models, specifically focusing on the logistic and Ricker equations by leveraging the gamma distribution to describe the underlying population. We begin by showing that when the variance is sufficiently small, the stochastic equations converge to their deterministic counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the stochastic equations exhibit two distinct branches of the intrinsic growth rate, corresponding to alternative stable states characterized by higher and lower growth rates.
  Notably, while the logistic model does not show a transition from a steady state to chaos, the Ricker model undergoes such a transition when the shape parameter of the gamma distribution is small. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the dynamic behavior in biological populations but also provide a robust framework for detecting chaos in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A General Coupling for Ising Models and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The couplings between the Ising model and its graphical representations, the random-cluster, random current and loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$ models, are put on common footing through a generalization of the Swendsen-Wang-Edwards-Sokal coupling. A new special case is that the single random current with parameter $2J$ on edges of agreement of XOR-Ising spins has the law of the double random current. The coupling also yields a general mechanism for constructing conditional Bernoulli percolation measures via uniform sampling, providing new perspectives on models such as the arboreal gas, random $d$-regular graphs, and self-avoiding walks. As an application of the coupling for the Loop-Cluster joint model, we prove that the regime of exponential decay of the $q$-state Potts model, the random-cluster representation, and its $q$-flow loop representation coincides on the torus, generalizing the Ising result. Finally, the Loop-Cluster coupling is generalized to lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On the Weak Error for Local Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local stochastic volatility refers to a popular model class in applied mathematical finance that allows for "calibration-on-the-fly", typically via a particle method, derived from a formal McKean-Vlasov equation. Well-posedness of this limit is a well-known problem in the field; the general case is largely open, despite recent progress in Markovian situations.
  Our take is to start with a well-defined Euler approximation to the formal McKean-Vlasov equation, followed by a newly established half-step-scheme, allowing for good approximations of conditional expectations. In a sense, we do Euler first, particle second in contrast to previous works that start with the particle approximation.
  We show weak order one for the Euler discretization, plus error terms that account for the said approximation. The case of particle approximation is discussed in detail and the error rate is given in dependence of all parameters used.</description>

      <title>The space of multifurcating ranked tree shapes: enumeration, lattice structure, and Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coalescent models of bifurcating genealogies are used to infer evolutionary parameters from molecular data. However, there are many situations where bifurcating genealogies do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral history of samples, and a multifurcating genealogy is required. The space of multifurcating genealogical trees, where nodes can have more than two descendants, is largely underexplored in the setting of coalescent inference. In this paper, we examine the space of rooted, ranked, and unlabeled multifurcating trees. We recursively enumerate the space and then construct a partial ordering which induces a lattice on the space of multifurcating ranked tree shapes. The lattice structure lends itself naturally to defining Markov chains that permit exploration on the space of multifurcating ranked tree shapes. Finally, we prove theoretical bounds for the mixing time of two Markov chains defined on the lattice, and we present simulation results comparing the distribution of trees and tree statistics under various coalescent models to the uniform distribution on this tree space.</description>

      <title>Sequential Dynamics in Ising Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact asymptotic characterization of sequential dynamics for a broad class of local update algorithms on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with Ising spins. Focusing on dynamics implemented via systematic scan -- encompassing Glauber updates at any temperature -- we analyze the regime where the number of spin updates scales linearly with system size. Our main result provides a description of the spin-field trajectories as the unique solution to a system of integro-difference equations derived via Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) applied to a novel block approximation. This framework captures the time evolution of macroscopic observables such as energy and overlap, and is numerically tractable. Our equations serve as a discrete-spin sequential-update analogue of the celebrated Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations for spherical spin glasses, resolving a long-standing gap in the theory of Ising spin glass dynamics. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, our results establish a foundation for analyzing a wide variety of asynchronous dynamics on the hypercube and offer new avenues for studying algorithmic limitations of local heuristics in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Eigenlogic and Probabilistic Inference; when Bayes meets Born</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows how inference is treated within the context of Eigenlogic projection operators in linear algebra. In Eigenlogic operators represent logical connectives, their eigenvalues the truth-values and the associated eigenvectors the logical models. By extension, a probabilistic interpretation is proposed using vectors outside the eigensystem of the Eigenlogic operators. The probability is calculated by the quantum mean value (Born rule) of the logical projection operators. We look here for possible connections between the Born rule in quantum mechanics and Bayes' theorem from probability theory and show that Eigenlogic offers an innovative approach to address the probabilistic version of logical inference (material implication) in a quantum context.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates exponential mixing of the invariant measure for randomly forced nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, with damping and random noise localized in space. Our study emphasizes the crucial role of exponential asymptotic compactness and control properties in establishing the ergodic properties of random dynamical systems.

      <title>A potential-theoretic approach to optimal stopping in a spectrally L\'evy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic solution method for optimal stopping problem of one-dimensional spectrally negative L\'evy processes. Our main tools are based on potential theory, particularly the Riesz decomposition and the maximum principle. This novel approach allows us to handle a broad class of reward functions. That is, we solve the problem in a general setup without relying on specific form of the reward function or on the fluctuation identities. We provide a step-by-step solution procedure, which is applicable to complex solution structures including multiple double-sided continuation regions.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2611</link>
      <description>arXiv:1305.2611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide an introduction to free probability theory, with a focus on tools and techniques useful in the study of large random matrices. Topics include freeness, free cumulants, additive and multiplicative free convolution, the R- and S-transforms, subordination theory, and operator-valued extensions. Applications to asymptotic freeness and linearization methods are discussed in detail. The notes aim to be accessible to graduate students with a background in functional analysis and probability.
  The lecture notes were originally written for a graduate course. They are updated to include recent results on subordination and linearization methods in free probability.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of branching Loewner evolutions and the Dyson superprocess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a construction of conformal processes that combines the theory of branching processes with chordal Loewner evolution. The main novelty lies in the choice of driving measure for the Loewner evolution: given a finite genealogical tree $\mathcal{T}$, we choose a driving measure for the Loewner evolution that is supported on a system of particles that evolves by Dyson Brownian motion at inverse temperature $\beta \in (0,\infty]$ between birth and death events.
  When $\beta=\infty$, the driving measure degenerates to a system of particles that evolves through Coulombic repulsion between branching events. In this limit, the following graph embedding theorem is established: When $\mathcal{T}$ is equipped with a prescribed set of angles, $\{\theta_v \in (0,\pi/2)\}_{v \in \mathcal{T}}$ the hull of the Loewner evolution is an embedding of $\mathcal{T}$ into the upper half-plane with trivalent edges that meet at angles $(2\theta_v,2\pi-4\theta_v,2\theta_v)$ at the image of each edge $v$.
  We also study the scaling limit when $\beta\in (0,\infty]$ is fixed and $\mathcal{T}$ is a binary Galton-Watson process that converges to a continuous state branching process. We treat both the unconditioned case (when the Galton-Watson process converges to the Feller diffusion) and the conditioned case (when the Galton-Watson tree converges to the continuum random tree). In each case, we characterize the scaling limit of the driving measure as a superprocess. In the unconditioned case, the scaling limit is the free probability analogue of the Dawson-Watanabe superprocess that we term the Dyson superprocess.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of Product of Ginibre Ensembles and Their Inverses and that of Truncated Haar Unitary Matrices and Their Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider two types of products of independent random matrices, including products of Ginibre matrices and inverse Ginibre matrices and products of truncated Haar unitary matrices and inverse truncated Haar matrices. Each product matrix has $m$ multiplicands of $n$ by $n$ square matrices, and the empirical distribution based on the $n$ eigenvalues of the product matrix is called empirical spectral distribution of the matrix. In this paper, we investigate the limiting empirical spectral distribution of the product matrices when $n$ tends to infinity and $m$ changes with $n$. For properly scaled eigenvalues for two types of the product matrices, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the empirical spectral distributions.</description>

      <title>Density Frankl-R\"{o}dl on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a density variant of the Frankl-R\"{o}dl theorem on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, which concerns avoiding pairs of vectors with a specific distance, or equivalently, a prescribed inner product. In particular, we establish lower bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen pair of such vectors lies entirely within a measurable subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ of sufficiently large measure. Additionally, we prove a density version of spherical avoidance problems, which generalize from pairwise avoidance to broader configurations with prescribed pairwise inner products. Our framework encompasses a class of configurations we call inductive configurations, which include simplices with any prescribed inner product $-1 &lt; r &lt; 1$. As a consequence of our density statement, we show that all inductive configurations are sphere Ramsey.</description>

      <title>Dilations and information flow axioms in categorical probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the positivity and causality axioms for Markov categories as properties of dilations and information flow in Markov categories, and in variations thereof for arbitrary semicartesian monoidal categories. These help us show that being a positive Markov category is merely an additional property of a symmetric monoidal category (rather than extra structure). We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely. Finally, we note that positivity fails for quasi-Borel spaces and interpret this failure as a privacy property of probabilistic name generation.</description>

      <title>Non-constant ground configurations in the disordered ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The disordered ferromagnet is a disordered version of the ferromagnetic Ising model in which the coupling constants are non-negative quenched random. A ground configuration is an infinite-volume configuration whose energy cannot be reduced by finite modifications. It is a long-standing challenge to ascertain whether the disordered ferromagnet on the $\mathbb{Z}^D$ lattice admits non-constant ground configurations. We answer this affirmatively in dimensions $D\ge 4$, when the coupling constants are sampled independently from a sufficiently concentrated distribution. The obtained ground configurations are further shown to be translation-covariant with respect to $\mathbb{Z}^{D-1}$ translations of the disorder.
  Our result is proved by showing that the finite-volume interface formed by Dobrushin boundary conditions is localized, and converges to an infinite-volume interface. This may be expressed in purely combinatorial terms, as a result on the fluctuations of certain minimal cutsets in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^D$ endowed with independent edge capacities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the diffusion model as a method to generate new samples. Generative models have been recently adopted for tasks such as art generation (Stable Diffusion, Dall-E) and text generation (ChatGPT). Diffusion models in particular apply noise to sample data and then "reverse" this noising process to generate new samples. We will formally define these noising and denoising processes, then present algorithms to train and generate with a diffusion model. Afterward, we will explore a potential application of diffusion models in improving classifier performance on imbalanced data.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Robust Covariance Shrinkage for Hotelling's $T^2$ in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate covariance shrinkage for Hotelling's $T^2$ in the regime where the data dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ grow in a fixed ratio -- without assuming that the population covariance matrix is spiked or well-conditioned. When $p/n\to\phi \in (0,1)$, we propose a practical finite-sample shrinker that, for any maximum-entropy signal prior and any fixed significance level, (a) asymptotically maximizes power under Gaussian data, and (b) asymptotically saturates the Hanson--Wright lower bound on power in the more general sub-Gaussian case. Our approach is to formulate and solve a variational problem characterizing the optimal limiting shrinker, and to show that our finite-sample method consistently approximates this limit by extending recent local random matrix laws. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world data, including the Crawdad UMich/RSS data set, demonstrate up to a $50\%$ gain in power over leading linear and nonlinear competitors at a significance level of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02275v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as a user's guide to sampling strategies for sliced optimal transport. We provide reminders and additional regularity results on the Sliced Wasserstein distance. We detail the construction methods, generation time complexity, theoretical guarantees, and conditions for each strategy. Additionally, we provide insights into their suitability for sliced optimal transport in theory. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data offer a representative comparison of the strategies, culminating in practical recommendations for their best usage.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions via orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: given $k \leq d/2$, does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)? Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proved the a.a.s. existence for every odd $k$ using earlier results regarding orientations satisfying certain degree conditions modulo $k$.
  In this paper we give a direct, self-contained proof that works for every $d$ and every $k&lt;d/2-1$. In fact, we prove stronger results. Let $s\geq 1$ denote the integer part of $d/(2k)$. We show that the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. has a $k$-star decomposition such that the number of stars centered at each vertex is either $s$ or $s+1$. Moreover, if $k &lt; d/3$ or $k \leq d/2 - 2.6 \log d$, we can even prescribe the set of vertices with $s$ stars, as long as it is of the appropriate size.</description>
