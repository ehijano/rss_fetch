      <title>Measuring Rotation Periods in Crowded Star Clusters with TESS: A Proof-of-Concept with NGC 3532</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, producing full-frame images (FFIs) every 30 min (Cycles 1$-$2), 10 min (Cycles 3$-$4), and now 200 s (Cycle 5+), over 27-day sectors. Light curves extracted from FFIs can be used to measure stellar rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$) in nearby open clusters, and are well-suited for studying low-mass stars ($\lesssim$1.2 M$_\odot$) younger than $\approx$1 Gyr, whose $P_{\rm rot}$ are generally still $\leq$15 days. A challenge to exploiting TESS data fully is its 21$''$ pixel size, which can cause strong signals from a source to contaminate the signals of nearby sources in the crowded environments found, e.g., in the more distant and/or richest clusters. We conducted a test with the young ($\approx$350 Myr old), moderately distant (470 pc), and rich open cluster NGC 3532 ($N_\star$ &gt; 3000), which has an extensive $P_{\rm rot}$ catalog from ground-based photometry, to examine the reliability of $P_{\rm rot}$ obtained from TESS data. We recovered 69% of the literature periods from at least one of the three TESS cycles in which NGC 3532 was observed before any quality analysis. We then used all available TESS data for low-mass members of NGC 3532 and, applying a set of quality cuts that combined information from TESS and from Gaia, measured $P_{\rm rot}$ for 885 cluster stars, adding 706 new $P_{\rm rot}$ to the existing catalog. We conclude that, when considered with appropriate caution, TESS data for stars in crowded fields can yield reliable $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>The r-Process: History, Required Conditions, Astrophysical Sites, and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review of the rapid-neutron-capture (i.e. r-) process starts with determining the Solar System r-abundance pattern via first obtaining (and subtracting) the contribution from the slow-neutron capture (s-) process. We emphasize the extensive work in this area by our late colleague Roberto Gallino and continue in an overview, concentrating on attempts to reproduce the solar r-process pattern with historical site-independent approaches, based on nuclear physics far from stability. In a second step we address the existing proposals for astrophysical sites. Among stellar observations we start with available observations of individual events before analyzing low-metallicity stars, which witness r-process contributions in the early Galaxy.We conclude with a comparison of observations and model predictions, focusing on our present ability to identify the responsible individual astrophysical sites by their imprint in Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>The optical photometric and spectroscopic periodicities of the cataclysmic variable SRGt 062340.2-265751</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on optical spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the eROSITA discovered transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 and show that it displays the characteristics of a nova-like cataclysmic variable (CV), with possible indications of being a magnetic system. We try to put better constraints on the classification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 using optical time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations to find any periodicities in the system. From these periodicities we can classify the CV sub-type that it belongs to. Spectroscopic observations revealed a very low amplitude, K $\sim$ 14 km s$^{-1}$, in the radial velocity of the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission lines, suggesting that the system is likely observed at a low inclination angle. High-speed photometric observations revealed highly stochastic variability, characteristic of many magnetic cataclysmic variable systems. A probable 3.645 $\pm$ 0.006 hour orbital period was found by applying Lomb-Scargle period analysis to the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission line radial velocities. A 24.905 $\pm$ 0.065 min period was found from photometric observations, which we associate with the white dwarf spin. However, it was also found that the photometry revealed multiple periodicities from night to night. TESS observations in three sectors did not reveal any of the periodicities found from ground-based observations, but did show a prominent period in only one sector, which might be attributed to a positive superhump period. These multiple periodicities as well as the HeII $\lambda$4686 and Bowen blend emission lines seen in the spectra indicate that SRGt 062340.2-265751 is likely a nova-like CV, and might belong to the VY Scl sub-type.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Solar X-ray Spectroscopy from Archived Solar Maximum Mission Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archived high-resolution X-ray spectra in the 13~\AA\ to 22~\AA\ range from the Flat Crystal Spectrometer (FCS), an instrument on the Solar Maximum Mission operating in the 1980s, are analyzed with reference to nonflaring active regions, and to the \ion{Fe}{17} line emission in light of laboratory and atomic data for nearby \ion{Fe}{16} satellites. The satellites allow temperature to be found for these relatively low-temperature spectra, at which more conventional temperature-dependent line ratios are unavailable. By this means, the spectra can be arranged by temperature, showing that the \ion{Fe}{17} lines are evident at temperatures of $&lt;3$~MK. We confirm that the problem of the underintense Fe XVII 3C and 3D lines is not due to resonant scattering, and instead suggest that, for comparison with CHIANTI spectra, the problem may lie with a needed revision of collisional excitation rates. The line ratio 3G/3H is in theory density-dependent but for \ion{Fe}{17} the ratio is in the low-density limit. However, we suggest that spectra taken during the impulsive stage of flares might reveal a departure from this limit and so allow densities to be derived and hence properties of the flaring plasma. Suggestions for the design of future crystal spectrometers are made in the light of the fluorescence background in FCS spectra.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Stellar Activity and Habitable Zone II: Ca H&amp;K Emissions of Late-type Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar chromospheric activity serves as a valuable proxy for estimating stellar ages, though its applicable range and accurate functional form are still debated. In this study, utilizing the LAMOST spectra we compiled a catalog of open cluster members and field stars to investigate $R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$--age relations across various spectral types. We find that a linear model, specifically a Skumanich-type relation, can best describe the overall decline of chromospheric activity with age, with the slope varying across different spectral types. However, we also identify variations in the decay rate along the main sequence, which call for more accurate follow-up investigation. Finally, we find that lower-metallicity stars exhibit enhanced activity for F-, G-, and K-type stars, whereas no clear metallicity dependence is observed for M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Sigmoid Formation, Filament Destabilization, and Initiation of Weak Flare by Tether-Cutting Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied a B-class solar flare and an associated filament eruption through multi-wavelength observations. The flare triggers at 16:24~UT on June 7$^{th}$, 2017 from an active region (AR) 12661, and it maximizes at 16:54~UT. The magnetic flux cancellation occurs near the polarity inversion line (PIL) preceding the flare, and ultraviolet (UV) brightenings occur in the pre-flare phase at the flux cancellation sites, suggesting the reconnection occurs in the lower atmosphere, initially. The S-shaped sigmoid forms through successive steps in corona, i.e., small-scale brightenings, helical/twisted field lines, bright patches, and finally, a developed sigmoid. It justifies that runaway reconnection within the coronal arcades forms the sigmoid within the filament. The differential emission-measure (DEM) analysis reveals the existence of the plasma at a temperature of more than 10 MK within the sigmoid. The initial magnetic reconnection reorganizes the field overlying the filament as per the tether-cutting model. Therefore, it enables the filament to rise slowly, and around~16:41~UT, the eruption phase of the filament begins. The filament eruption removes the overlying coronal field, including the sigmoid. During the eruption phase, we have found intersecting/crossing of coronal loops and jet-like structures far away from the sigmoid-filament system. In conclusion, all the observational findings (e.g., magnetic flux convergence, cancellation, UV brightenings, and spatial and temporal correlation between formation/evolution of the sigmoid and rise/eruption of the filament) suggest that the formation of a solar flare and the eruption of the filament are consistent with the tether-cutting model of solar eruption.</description>

      <title>JOYS: JWST MIRI/MRS spectra of the inner 500 au region of the L1527 IRS bipolar outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study characterizes the physical and kinematic properties within the innermost 500 au region of the L1527 bipolar outflow, a Class 0/I low-mass protostar using JWST MIRI/MRS spectroscopy across 5-28 micron at 0.2-1.0 arcsec resolution. We identify emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyze their spatial morphology using line integrated intensity maps. We derive gas temperature and column density through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. Radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals the presence of molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The co-existence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggest L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical for its early evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>Inferring photospheric horizontal flows from multiple observations with SUVEL models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photospheric horizontal velocity fields play essential roles in the formation and evolution of numerous solar activities. Various methods for estimating the horizontal velocity field have been proposed in the past. Aiming at the highest available (and future) spatial resolution (10 km/pixel) observations, a new method the Shallow U-net models (SUVEL) based on realistic numerical simulation and machine learning techniques was recently developed to track the photospheric horizontal velocity fields. Although SUVEL has been tested on numerical simulation data, its performance on solar observational data remained unclear. In this work, we apply SUVEL to the photospheric intensity observations from four ground-based solar telescopes (DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST) with the largest available apertures, and compare the results obtained from SUVEL with the Fourier local correlation tracking method (FLCT). Average correlation indices between granular regions and velocity fields inferred by SUVEL (FLCT) are 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.87 (0.00, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.10) for DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST observations. Higher correlation indices between the velocity fields tracked by SUVEL and granular patterns than FLCT reveal the superior performance of SUVEL, validating its reliability with respect to solar observational data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mass Loss at the End of TP-AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase plays a key role in the evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars, driving mass loss that influences their final stages and contributes to galactic chemical enrichment. However, the mechanisms behind mass loss, particularly at the end of AGB, are still not well understood. We aim to investigate the relationship between stellar parameters and envelope dynamics during the TP-AGB phase, evaluating whether dynamical instabilities in the envelope can act as a possible mass-loss mechanism. We use hydrodynamics method in MESA to simulate the dynamical pulsations and resulting mass loss during the TP-AGB phase of a star evolved from a 1.5 Msun zero-age main sequence. Our simulations reproduce the dynamical pulsation behavior of stars during the TP-AGB phase, demonstrating that the envelope mass is a key factor governing pulsational properties. As the envelope mass decreases, both the pulsation period and radial amplitude increase, consistent with observational trends. For 1.5 Msun model, once the envelope mass declines to approximately 0.25 Msun, the model enters a regime of violent pulsations, potentially ejecting the remaining envelope within a few hundred years. We suggest that the instability can act as the dominant mass-loss mechanism in the end of the TP-AGB phase, marking a rapid transitional stage toward the post-AGB phase.</description>

      <title>Different Transient Phenomena at the Edges of Traveling Foreshocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.</description>

      <title>Detached eclipsing binary star science in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (DEBS) are currently the best source of accurate and precise fundamental stellar parameters. This makes DEBS crucial targets for constraining the impact of various physical processes on stellar structure and evolution. Long-period binaries are particularly interesting because their separation minimises interactions between the components. This makes long-period binaries more comparable to single stars. However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods &lt; 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Such facilities would need to be able to obtain spectroscopic observations of more distant objects at high resolution and cadence. 2-8m class telescopes with echelle spectrographs and an ability to monitor a large sample of stars would be required.</description>

      <title>Sub-ion scale current sheets in kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed using the kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) eigenvector relations from a two-fluid model as initial conditions, in order to study turbulent fluctuations and intermittent structures at sub-ion and electron scales. Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.</description>

      <title>150 years of ground-based solar instrumentation at Meudon observatory (1876-2026)</title>

Abstract: The Sun has been observed through a telescope for four centuries. However, its study made a prodigious leap at the end of the nineteenth century with the appearance of photography and spectroscopy, then at the beginning of the following century with the invention of the coronagraph and monochromatic filters, and finally in the second half of the twentieth century with the advent of large ground-based telescopes and space exploration. This article retraces the main stages of solar instrumental developments in Meudon, from its foundation by Jules Janssen in 1876 to the present day, limited to ground-based or balloon instrumentation, designed in Meudon and installed there or in other places (Nan{\c c}ay, Pic du Midi, Canary Islands). The Meudon astronomers played a pioneering role in the history of solar physics through the experimentation of innovative techniques. After the golden age of inventions, came the time of large instruments, studied in Meudon but often installed in more favourable sites, and that of space, in a framework of international collaboration, but this is not discussed here.</description>

      <title>Resolution Dependence in Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\mathord{\approx}10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\mathord{\approx}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.</description>

      <title>Ancient relic moderately metal-rich bulge cluster Tonantzintla 2</title>

Abstract: The assembly history of the Galactic bulge is intimately tied to the formation of the proto-Milky Way, yet reconstructing this early phase is difficult because mergers and secular evolution have erased most of its original structure. Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment.</description>

      <title>New parameters for star cluster dynamics: observational results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently used a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters (GCs) to define new fully empirical parameters (named A5, P5, and S2.5) able to trace the internal dynamical evolution of dense stellar systems. These parameters are specifically designed to quantify the steepness of the cumulative radial distribution of stars in the innermost region of the host system, which tends to progressively increase with dynamical aging due to core contraction. Following the original definitions, here we measure A5 and P5 in a sample of 40 Galactic GCs homogeneously surveyed through HST photometric observations. In agreement with the predictions of our simulations, the largest values of A5 and P5 are found for the most dynamically evolved GCs, i.e., those previously classified as post-core collapse systems based on the shape of their density profile, and those characterized by the shortest central relaxation times. Moreover, the new dynamical parameters here measured strongly correlate with A+rh, another fully empirical, independent parameter that traces the dynamical age of star clusters through the level of central segregation of blue straggler stars.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thermal emission of old neutron stars with rotochemical heating and magnetized superconducting protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Role of the symmetry energy on hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of the symmetry energy on the properties of compact stars is analyzed considering constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics. A compact star can be a neutron star composed only of nuclear matter or a hybrid star with a quark core. Two typical models (soft and stiff) are considered for the nuclear equation of state, and for the hybrid one, a parameterized first-order phase transition approach, completed with a linear quark matter equation of state, is implemented. We show that the phase transition reduces the tension between GW170817 and NICER observations, and we illustrate the impact of the symmetry energy for the understanding of the nature of the binary system in GW170817. We also confirm our previous findings that the GW170817 waveform is best described as a binary HS with a low-density onset of stiff quark matter. This could also be interpreted as a quarkyonic cross-over.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of AGB Mass Transfer in Gaia White Dwarf Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous abundance analysis of 160 main-sequence stars in astrometric white-dwarf + main-sequence (WD+MS) binaries with orbits from Gaia DR3. These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 43 barium dwarfs -- 39 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\rm C_2$ absorption bands, confirming a link between barium stars and CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity. Our results establish Gaia WD+MS binaries -- which are homogeneously selected and probe shorter orbital periods than previous barium-star samples -- as a powerful laboratory for constraining mass transfer physics and the origin of chemically peculiar stars.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of $2.14~\mathrm{dex}$ on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of $4.78~\mathrm{dex}$. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>

      <title>Gaia20fnr: A binary-lens microlensing event with full orbital motion revealed by four space telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\rm S} = 3.10 \pm 0.10\,\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\rm L,1} = 0.46 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm L,2} = 0.52 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L} = 0.54 \pm 0.05\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The light curve exhibits strong signatures of orbital motion and requires a full Keplerian model with a period of $P = 0.67 \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{yr}$ and a radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $K_1 = 16.9 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-Disk Collisions for Quasiperiodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>The environment of TeV halo progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TeV haloes are extended sources of very-high-energy gamma rays found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding the type of medium pulsars probe over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions - where they receive a natal kick - until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; and (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess the medium in which pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derived the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population and then applied the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the interstellar medium at around 300 kyr, significantly later than assumed in the literature. Given our assumptions, all known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. To test this, we provide the probability that known pulsars still reside in their parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</description>

      <title>Can the jet precession of M87$^\ast$ be caused by a distant intermediate-mass black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of a two-body system acted upon by a remote massive pointlike object are analytically worked out, to the Newtonian quadrupolar level, without any restriction either on the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the disturbed pair or the position of the distant perturber. The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application to the case of the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$. In principle, the presence of another distant intermediate-mass black hole may concur to cause the observed jet precession, assumed tightly coupled with the accretion disk. Such a possibility is ruled out by the exclusion plots in the parameter space obtained with the approach presented here.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the field lines of $\vec{B}$ reconnect, but the lines of a related field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not. $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although a full four-dimensional relativistic calculation of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ has been made, studies of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ have been focused on systems that depend on only two spatial coordinates. Three results are given: (1) A relatively simple demonstration in three dimensional space that the lines of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ do not reconnect when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect. (2) The guiding center motion of charged particles is modified by a term that is proportional to $(c/\omega_{pe})^2$, which is smaller than the drifts proportional to the gyroradius unless the current density is extremely large. (3) In three dimensional space, the evolution velocity of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is characteristically chaotic, which means neighboring streamlines separate exponentially on a timescale $\tau_u$. $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ undergoes large scale reconnection on a timescale that is only an order of magnitude or two longer than $\tau_u$ unless all diffusive non-ideal effects, such as resistivity, are absolutely zero.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J013656.5+093347, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k = 3) at pressure levels ~ 1 bar, corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation, suggest a potential North-South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: The topological origin of Bohm resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta \propto T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the ensemble of electron gyro-axes in a magnetized plasma as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the "frozen-in" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</description>
