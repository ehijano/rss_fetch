      <title>Cosmic Hysteresis in Reconstructed $f(T)$ Bounce Models A Torsion-Based Thermodynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic and bouncing cosmologies within the framework of reconstructed $f(T)$ gravity. In contrast to curvature-based modifications of General Relativity, teleparallel gravity attributes gravitation to spacetime torsion encoded in the torsion scalar $T$. By reconstructing viable $f(T)$ functions corresponding to analytically prescribed nonsingular bouncing scale factors and coupling the geometry to a minimally interacting canonical scalar field, we demonstrate that asymmetric scalar field dynamics between expansion and contraction phases give rise to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral $\oint p_\phi \, dV$ over complete cycles. This hysteresis manifests as closed loops in the $(w_\phi,a)$ plane, signifying thermodynamic memory and irreversibility. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, establish exact bounce and turnaround conditions, and discuss the implications of torsion-induced hysteresis for the cosmological arrow of time. Our results confirm that cosmic hysteresis is a generic feature of cyclic universes in modified gravity, extending beyond curvature-based theories.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Inflation in n-Dimensional Fractional Scalar Field Cosmology: Observational Constraints and Dynamical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law inflation with $a(t) \propto t^m$ is conceptually simple and predicts a scalar tilt $n_s = 1 - 2/m$ compatible with CMB data, but in four-dimensional Einstein gravity it typically yields a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 16/m$ that is too large to satisfy current bounds. We show that a minimal extension based on fractional scalar-field cosmology resolves this tension. Introducing a fractional order $\alpha \neq 1$ generates non-local (memory) corrections in the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon dynamics that suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ essentially unchanged. We derive an explicit mapping $\alpha(n,m)$ and recover the standard power-law limit as $\alpha \to 1$. For observationally favored values $\alpha \approx 0.8$-$0.9$ in four dimensions we obtain $n_s \approx 0.965$ and $r \lesssim 0.04$, bringing power-law inflation into agreement with data. The scalar potential follows self-consistently as an exponential, and a dynamical-systems analysis shows the fractional power-law solutions form stable inflationary attractors over the viable parameter range. These results establish fractional power-law inflation as a predictive and testable framework, with clear targets for forthcoming CMB polarization measurements.</description>

      <title>The most general four-derivative Unitary String Effective Action with Torsion and Stringy-Running-Vacuum-Model Inflation: Old ideas from a modern perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string-inspired running vacuum model (StRVM) of inflation is based on a Chern-Simons (CS) gravity effective action, in which the only four-spacetime-derivative-order term is a gravitational anomalous CS Pontryagin density coupled to an axion. In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.</description>

      <title>A Brief Review of Wormhole Cosmic Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities, in the sense that curvature invariants are infinite at some point or region, are thought to be impossible to observe, and must be hidden within an event horizon. This conjecture is called Cosmic Censorship (CC), and was formulated by Penrose. Here we review another type of CC where spacetime singularities are causally disconnected from the universe, because the throat of a wormhole ``sucks in'' the geodesics and prevents them from making contact with the singularity. In this work, we present a series of exact solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton equations that feature a ring singularity; that is, the curvature invariants are singular in this ring, but the ring is causally disconnected from the universe so that no geodesics can touch it. This extension of CC is called Wormhole Cosmic Censorship.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many attempts to introduce fundamental nonlocality into quantum (or classical) field theory are based on the assumption that exponentials of the d'Alembertian are positive-definite, so that these operators can be employed without engendering the Ostrogradskian instability associated with higher derivative Lagrangians. {\bf This assumption is false.} Working in the simple context of a 1-dimensional, point particle $q(t)$, I demonstrate that the equation $\exp[T^2 \tfrac{d^2}{dt^2}] q(t) = 0$ has an infinite number of rapidly oscillating, exponentially rising and falling solutions. This infinite kernel is in one-to-one correspondence with the ability to specify ``initial value data'' {\it arbitrarily} over {\it any} finite interval $t_1 &lt; t &lt; t_2$.</description>

      <title>On the Possibility of Quantum Gravity Emerging from Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to induce an effective generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) emerging from geometry and reinterpret the gravitational GUP as the effective uncertainty relation induced by microscopic horizon geometry? More broadly, is it possible to develop a notion of quantum gravity emerging from geometry? We will give a positive answer, but with important caveats.</description>

      <title>Rotating Black Holes with Primary Scalar Hair: Shadow Signatures in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87* provides a direct test of strong-field gravity, measuring an angular shadow diameter $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3~\mu\mathrm{as}$ and a circularity deviation $\Delta C \leq 0.1$. Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $\theta_d$ and $\Delta C$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q&gt;0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\mathcal{O}(\mu\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging.</description>

      <title>Tidal Deformation Bounds and Perturbation Transfer in Bounded Curvature Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive two model-independent results for spacetimes with globally bounded tidal fields. These are operational resolution scales of the local-inertial approximation and tidal dynamics; no spacetime discreteness is implied. Given an invariant bound $\lambda_{\max}\le\lambda_{\rm bound}$ on the electric Riemann eigenvalues $E_{ij}\equiv R_{\hat{0}i\hat{0}j}$ along freely falling worldlines, we prove (i)~a rigorous upper bound on accumulated geodesic deviation through any bounded curvature interior, controlled by $\tau_*\equiv\lambda_{\max}^{-1/2}$, and (ii)~the existence of a critical wavenumber $k_*\sim\tau_*^{-1}$ separating adiabatic from non-adiabatic perturbation transfer through high-curvature epochs, with Bogoliubov coefficients exponentially suppressed for $k\,\tau_*\gg 1$. Both results depend only on the tidal bound (and, for mode transfer, on a mild timescale assumption for the curvature-driven effective potential) and are otherwise insensitive to metric details. For preparation, we collect the standard operational consequences of bounded curvature, including the accuracy-dependent local-inertial domain $L_{\rm LI}(\varepsilon)\sim\sqrt{\varepsilon}\, \lambda_{\max}^{-1/2}$ and, for conformally flat cores in four dimensions, the benchmark ratio $\tau_*/L_*=24^{1/4}$ with $L_*\equiv K_{\max}^{-1/4}$. We quantify the robustness of this coefficient under departures from maximal symmetry via the Weyl-to-Kretschmann ratio $\epsilon_C$. The general framework is validated numerically in the extremal Hayward geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Holes formed by Null Energy Condition Violation during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transient violation of the null energy condition (NEC) during inflation provides a novel mechanism for producing primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds. In this work, we extend previous studies by computing the GW contributions from both the ringdown phase of PBH formation and subsequent binary mergers. Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations.</description>

      <title>Entropy Modifications from Stochastic Metric Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations from the area law of the horizon entropy, in the cosmological setup, are known to lead to modified Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the universe. In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including R\'enyi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies. Our results suggest that deviations from the area law can be interpreted as the macroscopic, coarse-grained imprint of unresolved, microscopic stochastic degrees of freedom in spacetime.</description>

      <title>The Penrose-Rindler equation and horizon thermodynamics of stationary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are the natural arena for exploring the interplay between gravity and thermodynamics. Although the association between black hole mechanics and black hole thermodynamics is well-established, the comprehensive geometric formulation of thermodynamic variables deserves further investigation. In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>General formalism, classification, and demystification of the current warp-drive spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically examine proposals for the so-called warp-drive spacetimes and classify these models based on their various restrictions within the framework of General Relativity. We then provide a summary of general formalism for each class, and in the process, we highlight some misconceptions, misunderstandings, and errors in the literature that have been used to support claims about the physicality and feasibility of these models. On the way, we prove several new no-go theorems. Our analysis shows that when the principles of General Relativity are applied correctly, most claims regarding physical warp drives must be reassessed, and it becomes highly challenging to justify or support the viability of such models, not merely due to the violation of energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Testing non-circular black hole spacetime with X-ray reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool for testing the Kerr hypothesis and probing the strong gravity regime around accreting black holes. Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($\iota \approx 76^{\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}} \approx 0.12$), the 99\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using X-ray reflection spectroscopy to constrain non-circular metrics and establishes a framework for future tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the physical basis of classical mechanics, such as expressed commonly using the framework of Newton's Principia. Newton's formulation of the laws of motion is seen to have quite a few ambiguities and shortcomings. Therefore I offer an alternative set of laws, based in particular on ideas of his contemporaries Huygens and Leibniz with a crucial addition by Ludwig Lange, which avoids the problems with Newton's formulation. It is shown that from these laws of motion all the usual results of classical mechanics, as it concerns the motion of idealized point masses, can be rederived. The application of these principles to relativistic point particles is discussed.</description>

      <title>Foiling Black Hole Foils: Revealing Horizon Alternatives with Baryonic Atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event horizons are a defining feature of black holes. Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes swallow stellar objects at high rates: from Little Red Dots to Black Hole Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</description>

      <title>Solving BDNK diffusion using physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reformulate the relativistic BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) diffusion equation in flux-conservative form, and solve the resulting equations in $(1+1)$D using both a second-order Kurganov-Tadmor finite volume scheme and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In particular, we introduce the SA-PINN-ACTO framework, which combines the self-adaptive PINN technique with an exact enforcement of initial and periodic boundary conditions through an algebraic transform of the network's raw output, allowing the network to focus solely on minimizing the PDE residual. We test both approaches on smooth and discontinuous initial data, for both trivial and dynamically evolving velocity and temperature BDNK backgrounds, and for two characteristic speeds. The SA-PINN-ACTO method matches the converged Kurganov-Tadmor solutions for smooth profiles, while for discontinuous profiles the errors increase, reflecting an expected limitation of PINNs near sharp gradients.</description>

      <title>Multi-centered Myers-Perry Black Holes in Five Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new family of multi-centered rotating black hole solutions in 5D vacuum Einstein gravity, providing explicit examples of cohomogeneity-three spacetimes. It is well known that, in the presence of two commuting Killing vector fields, the theory reduces to 3D gravity coupled to an $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields. We show that the scalar fields of the extremal Myers-Perry solution can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions on 3D flat space, and that promoting these functions to include multiple sources yields explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes located at arbitrary positions. Each center forms a smooth $S^3$ Killing horizon, provided that the rotation parameters satisfy $|j_i|&lt;1/2$. We further demonstrate that all curvature singularities are hidden behind the horizons and that no closed timelike curves arise on or outside the horizons. The solutions are asymptotically locally Minkowski in the sense that constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). As a concrete example, we consider a binary configuration, examine its rod structure, and demonstrate the absence of conical singularities between the two black holes, indicating that they are supported by an intermediate bubble region separating them.</description>

      <title>Topological variations in General Relativity: a rigorous perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the theory of gravitation, we revisit the idea of topological variations, originally introduced by Wheeler and Hawking, from a rigorous perspective. Starting from a localized version of the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle, we encode the key aspects of the variational procedure in the form of a topology on a suitable space of variational configurations with low Sobolev regularity. This structure is the final topology with respect to the admissible variational maps and naturally lends itself to generalizations. We rigorously introduce two distinct types of topological variations, corresponding to the infinitesimal addition of disconnected components and to infinitesimal surgeries, both motivated by related physical concepts. Using tools from the theory of Sobolev spaces and precise asymptotics, we establish dimensional obstructions for the continuity and differentiability of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to these variations, and show that in the extended variational framework the action does not admit critical points in dimension $n=4$, while higher dimensions are free of this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the non-trivial effect of higher order curvature terms on the critical dimension.</description>

      <title>Two-mode dominance and deterministic parameter bias bounds for equatorial Kerr-de Sitter ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scalar waves on subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in a compact slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index. Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\pm\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\mathcal O(\ell^{-\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,\Lambda)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Prompt And Delayed Radio Bangs At Kilohertz By SN 1987A: A Test For Graviton-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604047</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9604047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   A sequence of prompt and delayed radio signals at tens of kilohertz should reach the Earth (or Jupiter) due to graviton--photon conversion in interstellar as well as local planetary magnetic fields. These radio fluxes may be a detectable probe of a huge gravitational burst expected from Supernovae explosions. The earliest prompt radio signal, coinciding with the neutrino burst, is due to conversion in the terrestrial (or Jovian) magnetic field and is below the micro-Jansky (or milli-Jansky) level for a galactic Supernova like SN1987A. A later radio signal, a ``tail'', due to the same graviton - radio wave conversion in random interstellar fields will maintain a relic radio ``noise'' for hundreds or thousands of years and might even be still detectable by a very sensitive network of satellite antennas at the kilohertz band. Exact solutions are presented here for the graviton-photon conversion in a refractive medium, as well as their consequences for high energy supernovae and the 2.726 K background radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05732v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the conservation laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in an expanding homogeneous and isotropic Universe that can be applied to the study of early Universe physics during the epoch of radiation domination. The conservation laws for a conducting perfect fluid with relativistic bulk velocities in an expanding background are presented (for the first time in their non-conservation form, i.e., as dynamical equations for the velocity and energy density fluid variables), and extending previous results that apply in the limit of subrelativistic bulk motion. Furthermore, it is shown that the subrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in previous work. We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a radiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables that are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is subrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that have been proposed for matter-dominated fluids and present this choice of coordinates for any equation of state. First-order fluid dynamics to include imperfect relativistic fluids and the scaling of the transport coefficients with temperature in the early Universe are presented. We review the propagation of sound waves, Alfv\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe plasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\'en speeds is presented and adapted for early Universe applications. This review is an extension, including new results, of part of the lectures presented at the minicourse "Simulations of Early Universe Magnetohydrodynamics" lectured by A. Roper Pol and J. Schober at EPFL, as part of the six-week program "Generation, evolution, and observations of cosmological magnetic fields" at the Bernoulli Center in May 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the coherence of mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states for bosonic and fermionic fields when a subset of $n$ ($n&lt;N$) qubits experiences Hawking radiation near a Schwarzschild black hole. Analytical expressions are derived for the coherence of mixed N-qubit systems, including both the physically accessible and inaccessible parts in curved spacetime. The results show that the mixed W state maintains its coherence more effectively than the GHZ state as the Hawking temperature increases, even though its entanglement is weaker. As the number of qubits grows, W-state coherence becomes increasingly resistant to gravitational decoherence. Furthermore, fermionic fields preserve stronger entanglement, while bosonic fields retain higher coherence, highlighting a clear contrast between different particle statistics. These findings demonstrate how the Schwarzschild spacetime reshapes the balance between quantum coherence and entanglement, offering guidance for future relativistic quantum information applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of black holes by the gravitational collapse of stars is known to spontaneously excite particle pairs out of the quantum vacuum. For the canonical vacuum state at past null infinity, the expected number of particles received at future null infinity can be obtained in full closed form at sufficiently late times. However, for intermediate times, or for more complicated astrophysical processes (e.g. binary black hole mergers), the problem is technically challenging and has not yet been resolved. We develop here a numerical approach to study scattering problems of massless quantum fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes, based on the hyperboloidal slice method used in numerical relativity and perturbation theory. This promising approach can reach both past and future null infinities, and therefore it has the potential to address the Hawking scattering problem more rigorously than evolution on the usual Cauchy slices. We test this approach with some dynamical toy models in Minkowski using effective potentials that mimic the effects of gravity, and compute the spectrum of particles received at future null infinity. We finally discuss future prospects for applying this framework in more relevant gravitational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it as an autonomous system, and provide a detailed discussion on the choice of initial conditions required to obtain stable background evolution of the models. We constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data, including both early- and late-time probes. We incorporate the improved Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year Type Ia supernova sample (DES-SN5YR), referred to as DES-Dovekie, which exhibits substantially lower tension with the Pantheon+ supernova sample. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend for the Pantheon+ and DES samples. However, upon including the Roman mock data, a significant departure is observed at higher redshifts, yielding statistically strong preference over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current transit universe model is a precise solution to the equations of a new type of gravity theory called metric-affine $f(R,T,Q,T_m)$ gravity proposed in [Herko et al. \textit{Phys. Dark Univ.} \textbf{34} (2021) 100886]. This theory is the maximal extension of the most successful theory, ``General Relativity," by including the scalars, Ricci curvature $R$, torsion $T$, nonmetricity $Q$, and trace $T_{m}$ of the matter-energy-momentum tensor using a generalized connection called the ``metric-affine" connection. We obtain the modified field equations for a linear form of the $f(R,T,Q,T_m)$ function and for a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic FLRW spacetime universe. We find a hyperbolic solution and determine the constrained values of the model parameters using the latest observational data. We examine how certain cosmological factors, like the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm eff}$, and dark energy equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm de}$, vary over time to explain the properties of the observable universe. We perform the $Om$ diagnostic test for the model, and it represents the phantom scenarios of the model. The behavior of the dark energy EoS parameter $\omega_{\rm de}$ reveals the quintom-A-type universe characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>Shadow of rotating black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Dynamics of Radiating Charges: Canonical Formulation and Binary Inspiral Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an explicit electromagnetic analogue of the post-Newtonian Hamiltonian framework widely used in gravitational-wave physics. Starting from the Lorentz-Dirac equation and implementing Landau-Lifshitz order reduction, we derive the near-zone 1.5 PN dipole radiation-reaction force and combine it with the Darwin Hamiltonian through 1PN order to obtain a closed canonical N-body phase-space system. The equations are directly implementable, strictly conservative when dissipation is switched off, and exhibit monotonic energy loss, secular inspiral, and circularization when radiation reaction is included. For binaries we derive analytic circular and eccentric inspiral laws, including 1PN conservative corrections to the dipole-driven inspiral and merger time. Extending to charged compact binaries in Einstein-Maxwell theory, we combine the 2PN ADM-type conservative Hamiltonian with leading 1.5PN dipole dissipation and gravitational quadrupole flux, obtaining gauge-invariant energy--frequency relations, closed-form circular inspiral laws, and a dipole-quadrupole crossover scale that separates electromagnetic and gravitational flux dominated inspirals.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Neutron Star Properties in $f(Q)$ Gravity Using NICER Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate neutron stars (NSs) in the strong field regime within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, considering three representative models: linear, logarithmic, and exponential. While Bayesian studies of NS observations are well established in general relativity and curvature based modified gravity theories, such analyses in $f(Q)$ gravity remain largely unexplored. For the first time we perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329 in the background of nonmetricity based gravity. The dense matter equation of state is fixed to DDME2 in order to isolate the effects of modified gravity on NS structure. Our results show that the exponential $f(Q)$ model is statistically preferred over the linear and logarithmic cases, as confirmed by Bayes factor comparisons, and exhibits well-constrained. For this model, we obtain a radius and tidal deformability at $1.4\,M_\odot$ of $R_{1.4} = 11.27^{+0.53}_{-0.36}\,\mathrm{km}$ and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 156.95^{+84.02}_{-41.73}$, respectively, consistent with current observational constraints. Remarkably, all three constrained models predict maximum neutron star masses reaching $M_{\max} \simeq 2.98\,M_{\odot}$, with the $95\%$ confidence regions extending into the lower mass gap ($\sim 2.5$--$5\,M_{\odot}$). This mass-gap prediction emerges naturally from the Bayesian-constrained parameter space. These results highlight the potential of NSs as powerful probes of symmetric teleparallel gravity in the strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic or Non-Adiabatic? Unraveling the Nature of Initial Conditions in the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-thermal nature of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) makes it difficult to define the initial condition for the graviton distribution, which determines the initial contribution to the CGWB anisotropies. Specifically, unlike Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, primordial gravitational waves (GWs) are not necessarily subject to adiabatic initial conditions. For the CGWB generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation the initial conditions are not adiabatic. The violation of adiabaticity arises from the presence of independent tensor perturbations during inflation, which behave as two extra fields that affect the standard single-clock argument. The non-adiabatic initial contribution enhances the total CGWB angular power spectrum compared to the standard adiabatic case. Given the high degree of correlation between the CGWB and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, we present the constrained realization maps of the CGWB built using the high-resolution CMB Planck maps for different initial conditions.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>Can GW231123 have a stellar origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+23}_{-18} M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50} M_\odot$ -- in the range of the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160\,M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90\% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We allow for differential rotation to explore the high-spin regime. In this limit of weak angular momentum transport, we find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing an important correlation between masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although well-studied at the level of perturbative scattering in vacuum, far less is known about non-perturbative aspects or extensions of the double copy beyond trivial backgrounds. We show here how Hawking radiation in a collapse metric, its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the double copy of particle production in a background gauge field, where there is no global horizon, nor a thermal spectrum. Our approach combines worldline and amplitudes methods, and allows the unification of several classical and quantum double copy prescriptions for black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Or should we talk about dS/CFT correspondence or dS/SFT correspondence in cosmological correlators? In non-unitary field theories -- which are conjectured to be dual to cosmological correlators -- scale invariance does not necessarily imply full conformal invariance. While general relativity predicts the emergence of conformal invariance (or boost symmetry in the bulk), various modified theories of gravity suggest only scale invariance, characterized by the absence of bulk boost symmetry. We demonstrate this distinction using Einstein-Aether theory as a canonical example.</description>
