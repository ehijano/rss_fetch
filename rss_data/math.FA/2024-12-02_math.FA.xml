      <title>Regularity of Characteristic Functions in Besov-Type and Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the authors determine the optimal regularity of characteristic functions in Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces under restrictions on the measure of the $\delta$-neighborhoods of the boundary. In particular, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in these spaces of characteristic functions of the snowflake domain and also some spiral type domains are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain Szeg\H{o}-type limit theorems for Toeplitz operators on the weighted Bergman spaces $A^{2}_{\alpha}(\mathbb{D})$, and on $L^{2}(G)$ where $G$ is a compact Abelian group. We also derive several abstract Szeg\H{o} limit theorems which include many related classical Szeg\H{o} limit theorems as a special case.</description>

      <title>Continuity aspects for traces of Dirichlet forms with respect to monotone weak convergence of G-Kato measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some analytic properties of traces of Dirichlet forms with respect to measures satisfying Hardy-type inequality. Among other results we prove convergence of spectra, ordered eigenvalues, eigenfunctions as well as convergence of resolvents on appropriate spaces, for traces of Dirichlet forms when the speed measure is the monotone weak limit of G-Kato measures. Some quantitative estimates are also given. As applications we show continuity of stationary solutions of some elliptic operators with measure-valued coefficients with respect to the coefficients and give an approximation procedure for the eigenvalues of one-dimensional graph Laplacian as well as for the Laplacian on annular thin sets with mixed Neumann- Wentzell boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Grushin Operator on Infinite Dimensional Homogeneous Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collection of infinite dimensional complete vector fields $\left\{V_i\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ acting on a locally convex manifolds $M$ on which a smooth positive measure $\mu$ is defined was considered. It was assumed that the vector fields generates an infinite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and satisfies H$\ddot{o}$rmander's condition. The sum of squares of Grushin operators related to the vector fields was examined and the operator is then considered as the generalized Grushin operator. The paramount proofs were Poincar$\acute{e}$ inequality, Gaussian two-bounded estimate for the related heat kernels and the doubling condition for the metric defined by the underlying vector fields.</description>

      <title>Operator Algebras of Universal Quantum Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two unital C*-algebras $A$ and $B$, we study, when it exists, the universal unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ generated by the coefficients of a unital $*$-homomorphism $\rho\,:\, A\rightarrow B\otimes\mathcal{U}(A,B)$. When $B$ is finite dimensional, it is well known that $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ exists and we study in this case properties LP, RFD, primitiveness and the UCT as well as $K$-theory. We also construct a reduced version of $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ for which we study exactness, nuclearity, simplicity, absence of non-trivial projection and $K$-theory. Then, we consider the von Neumann algebra generated by the reduced version and study factoriality, amenability, fullness, primeness, absence of Cartan, Connes' invariants, Haagerup property and Connes' embeddability. Next, we consider the case when $B$ is infinite dimensional: we show that for any non-trivial separable unital $C^*$-algebra $A$, $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ exists if and only if $B$ is finite dimensional. Nevertheless, we show that there exists a unique unital locally $C^*$-algebra generated by the coefficients of a unital continuous $*$-homomorphism $\rho\,:\, A\rightarrow B\otimes\mathcal{U}(A,B)$. Finally, we study a natural quantum semigroup structure on $\mathcal{U}(A,A)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Global Attractor of 2D Incompressible Turbulence in the Palinstrophy-Enstrophy-Energy Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic bounds on the projection of the global attractor of 2D incompressible turbulence in the palinstrophy--enstrophy plane [Dascaliuc, Foias, and Jolly 2005, 2010] are observed to vastly overestimate the values obtained from numerical simulations. This is due to the lack of a good estimate for the inner product $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ of the advection term and the biLaplacian. Sobolev inequalities like Ladyzhenskaya or Agmon's inequalities yield an upper bound that we show is not sharp. In fact, for statistically isotropic turbulence, the expected value of $(\cal{B}(u,u),A^2u)$ is zero. The implications for estimates on the behaviour of the global attractor are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a substitute to Feller property for semigroups of time-changed processes; under some conditions this leads to establish sufficient (new) conditions for the semigroups to be Feller. Moreover, given a standard process and a sequence of measures converging vaguely to a final measure, under some assumptions, we establish convergence of the sequence of the semigroups and the resolvents of the corresponding time changed-processes. Some applications are given: convergence of solutions of evolution equations and convergence of finite time distributions.</description>

      <title>On exponential frames near the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a relatively compact $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of Lebesgue measure $|\Omega|$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show the existence of a set $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of uniform density $D (\Lambda) \leq (1+\varepsilon) |\Omega|$ such that the exponential system $\{ \exp(2\pi i \lambda \cdot) \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}: \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ is a frame for $L^2 (\Omega)$ with frame bounds $A |\Omega|, B |\Omega|$ for constants $A,B$ only depending on $\varepsilon$. This solves a problem on the frame bounds of an exponential frame near the critical density posed by Nitzan, Olevskii and Ulanovskii. We also prove an extension to locally compact abelian groups, which improves a result by Agora, Antezana and Cabrelli by providing frame bounds involving the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics. Discrete and continuous symmetries are considered in different approaches. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with spectrality and a few further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra.</description>

      <title>Dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for group actions and groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for actions of discrete groups on compact spaces, and more generally for locally compact \'etale groupoids with compact unit space. Using the work of Bartels, L\"uck, and Reich to bridge our notion for group actions with asymptotic dimension growth for groups, thus providing many concrete examples for our notion. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic dimension growth for a discrete metric space of bounded geometry is equivalent to the dynamic asymptotic dimension growth for its associated coarse groupoid, hence deducing that the coarse groupoid with subexponential dynamic asymptotic dimension growth is amenable. More generally, every $\sigma$-compact locally compact Hausdorff \'etale groupoid with compact unit space having dynamic asymptotic dimension growth at most $x^{\alpha}$ $(0&lt;\alpha&lt;1)$ is amenable.</description>

      <title>Higher order error estimates for regularization of inverse problems under non-additive noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive higher order error estimates for inverse problems distorted by non-additive noise, in terms of Bregman distances. The results are obtained by means of a novel source condition, inspired by the dual problem. Specifically, we focus on variational regularization having the Kullback-Leibler divergence as data-fidelity, and a convex penalty term. In this framework, we provide an interpretation of the new source condition, and present error estimates also when a variational formulation of the source condition is employed. We show that this approach can be extended to variational regularization that incorporates more general convex data fidelities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate state feedback and observation for infinite-dimensional linear systems, including a variety of partial differential equations with boundary control and observation. We extend the modulating function approach to infinite-dimensional systems. This approach, simply put, involves reconstructing part of the state by convolving with null controls of the adjoint system. We show how this method aids in state reconstruction, and we also examine distributional solutions of the adjoint system, showing their ability to handle unbounded feedback operators. This enables us to use feedback from spatial point evaluations in partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: Higher rank graphs, also known as $k$-graphs, are a $k$-dimensional generalization of directed graphs and a rich source of examples of $C^*$-algebras. In the present paper, we contribute to the geometric classification program for $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras by introducing a new move on $k$-graphs, called LiMaR-split, which is a generalization of outsplit for directed graphs. We show, under one additional assumption, that LiMaR-split preserves the $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras up to Morita equivalence.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Stieltjes algebras, decomposable Fourier multipliers and amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13823v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $\mathrm{B}(G)$ of a discrete group $G$ is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)$ of decomposable Fourier multipliers on the group von Neumann algebra $\mathrm{VN}(G)$. In contrast, we show that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) \neq \mathrm{B}(G)$ for some classes of non-discrete locally compact groups, while we prove that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) = \mathrm{B}(G)$ holds for any (unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results, we leverage groupoid theory and investigate the problem of whether a contractive projection exists, preserving complete positivity, from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\mathrm{VN}(G)$ onto the space $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers. We provide an affirmative solution in the inner amenable case and demonstrate that such projections do not exist for non-amenable connected locally compact groups. Further, we investigate whether the space $\mathfrak{M}^{p,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathrm{VN}(G))$ is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Using doubling metrics on Lie groups and structural results from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we establish that any (unimodular) amenable locally compact group admits compatible bounded projections at the levels $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, which has applications to decomposable Fourier multipliers. Moreover, we present a new characterization of amenability.</description>

      <title>Epic math battle of history: Grothendieck vs Nikodym</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a $\sigma$-centered notion of forcing that forces the existence of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property and without the Nikodym property. In particular the existence of such an algebra is consistent with the negation of the continuum hypothesis. The algebra we construct consists of Borel subsets of the Cantor set and has cardinality $\omega_1$. We also show how to apply our method to streamline Talagrand's construction of such an algebra under the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A several variables Kowalski-S\lodkowski theorem for topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a version of the classical result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski that generalizes the famous Gleason-Kahane-$\dot{\rm Z}$elazko (GKZ) theorem by characterizing multiplicative linear functionals amongst all complex-valued functions on a Banach algebra. We first characterize maps on $\mathcal{A}$-valued polynomials of several variables that satisfy some conditions, motivated by the result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski, as a composition of a multiplicative linear functional on $\mathcal{A}$ and a point evaluation on the polynomials, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a complex Banach algebra with identity. We then apply it to prove an analogue of Kowalski and S\l odkowski's result on topological spaces of vector-valued functions of several variables. These results extend our previous work from \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}; however, the techniques used differ from those used in \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}. Furthermore, we characterize weighted composition operators between Hardy spaces over the polydisc amongst the continuous functions between them. Additionally, we register a partial but noteworthy success toward a multiplicative GKZ theorem for Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>Multivariate transforms of total positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belton-Guillot-Khare-Putinar [J. d'Analyse Math. 2023] classified the post-composition operators that preserve TP/TN kernels of each specified order. We explain how to extend this from preservers to transforms, and from one to several variables. Namely, given arbitrary nonempty totally ordered sets $X,Y$, we characterize the transforms that send each tuple of kernels on $X \times Y$ that are TP/TN of orders $k_1, \dots, k_p$, to a TP/TN kernel of order $l$, for arbitrary positive integers (or infinite) $k_j$ and $l$. An interesting feature is that to preserve TP (or TN) of order $2$, the preservers are products of individual power (or Heaviside) functions in each variable; but for all higher orders, the preservers are powers in a single variable. We also classify the multivariate transforms of symmetric TP/TN kernels; in this case it is the preservers of TP/TN of order 3 that are multivariate products of power functions, and of order 4 that are individual powers. The proofs use generalized Vandermonde kernels, Hankel kernels, (strictly totally positive) Polya frequency functions, and a kernel studied recently but tracing back to works of Schoenberg [Ann. of Math. 1955] and Karlin [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1964].</description>

      <title>Regularized Brascamp--Lieb inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any (forward) Brascamp--Lieb inequality on euclidean space, a famous theorem of Lieb guarantees that gaussian near-maximizers always exist. Recently, Barthe and Wolff used mass transportation techniques to establish a counterpart to Lieb's theorem for all non-degenerate cases of the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. Here we build on work of Chen--Dafnis--Paouris and employ heat-flow techniques to understand the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality for certain regularized input functions, in particular extending the Barthe--Wolff theorem to such a setting. Inspiration arose from work of Bennett, Carbery, Christ and Tao for the forward inequality, and we recover their generalized Lieb's theorem using a clever limiting argument of Wolff. In fact, we use Wolff's idea to deduce regularized inequalites in the broader framework of the forward-reverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality, in particular allowing us to recover the gaussian saturation property in this framework first obtained by Courtade, Cuff, Liu and Verd\'u.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Approach to Load Profile Forecasting in Power Grids using Galerkin-Approximated Koopman Pseudospectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an interpretable machine learning approach that characterizes load dynamics within an operator-theoretic framework for electricity load forecasting in power grids. We represent the dynamics of load data using the Koopman operator, which provides a linear, infinite-dimensional representation of the nonlinear dynamics, and approximate a finite version that remains robust against spectral pollutions due to truncation. By computing $\epsilon$-approximate Koopman eigenfunctions using dynamics-adapted kernels in delay coordinates, we decompose the load dynamics into coherent spatiotemporal patterns that evolve quasi-independently. Our approach captures temporal coherent patterns due to seasonal changes and finer time scales, such as time of day and day of the week. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions within power grids and their response to various exogenous factors. We assess our method using a large-scale dataset from a renewable power system in the continental European electricity system. The results indicate that our Koopman-based method surpasses a separately optimized deep learning (LSTM) architecture in both accuracy and computational efficiency, while providing deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of the power grid\footnote{The code is available at \href{https://github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}{github.com/Shakeri-Lab/Power-Grids}.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric and geometric inequalities in quantitative form: Stein's method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>
