      <title>The Bifurcation Growth Rate for the Robust Pattern Formation in the Reaction-Diffusion System on the Growing Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among living organisms, there are species that change their patterns on their body surface during their growth process and those that maintain their patterns. Theoretically, it has been shown that large-scale species do not form distinct patterns. However, exceptionally, even large-scale species like giraffes form and maintain patterns, and previous studies have shown that the growth plays a crucial role in pattern formation and transition. Here we show how the growth of the domain contributes to Turing bifurcation based on the reaction-diffusion system by applying the Gray-Scott model to the reaction terms, both analytically and numerically, focusing on the phenomenon of pattern formation and maintenance in large species like giraffes, where melanocytes are widely distributed. After analytically identifying the Turing bifurcation related to the growth rate, we numerically verify the pattern formation and maintenance in response to the finite-amplitude perturbations of the blue state specific to the Gray-Scott model near the bifurcation. Furthermore, among pairs of the parameters that form Turing patterns in a reaction-diffusion system on a fixed domain, we determine a pair of the parameters that maximizes the growth rate for the Turing bifurcation in a reaction-diffusion system on a time-dependently growing domain. Specifically, we conduct a numerical analysis to pursue the pair of the parameters in the Turing space that can be the most robust in maintaining the patterns formed on the fixed domain, even as the domain grows. This study may contribute to specifically reaffirming the importance of growth rate in pattern formation and understanding patterns that are easy to maintain even during growth.</description>

      <title>Learning a phenomenological theory for contact-interactions between motile cells from collision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on eleven candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, shape, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>

      <title>Scale-free behavior of weight distributions of connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To determine the precise link between form and function, brain studies primarily concentrate on the anatomical wiring of the brain and its topological properties. In this work, we investigate the weighted degree and connection length distributions of the KKI-113 and KKI-18 human connectomes, the fruit fly, and of the mouse retina. We found that the node strength (weighted degree) distribution behavior differs depending on the considered scale. On the global scale, the distributions are found to follow a power-law behavior, with a roughly universal exponent close to 3. However, this behavior breaks at the local scale as the node strength distributions of the KKI-18 follow a stretched exponential, and the fly and mouse retina follow the log-normal distribution, respectively which are indicative of underlying random multiplicative processes and underpins non-locality of learning in a brain close to the critical state. However, for the case of the KKI-113 and the H01 human (1mm$^3$) datasets, the local weighted degree distributions follow an exponentially truncated power-law, which may hint at the fact that the critical learning mechanism may have manifested at the node level too.</description>

      <title>Physical limits on galvanotaxis depends on cell morphology and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galvanotaxis is believed to be driven by the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and other molecules, referred to as "sensors", through electrophoresis and electroosmosis. Here, we update our previous model of the limits of galvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape and orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in principle possess more information about the electric field direction when their long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields maximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower variability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an alternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field direction by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional cue ("vector sum"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect not present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell elongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors migrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as is more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will elongate parallel to the field.</description>

      <title>Interdependence of sodium and potassium gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between sodium (Na$^+$) and potassium (K$^+$) gating variables in the 4-dimensional (4D) Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) electrophysiology model and reduce its complexity by deriving new 3D and 2D models that retain the original model's dynamic properties. The new 3D and 2D models are based on the relationship $h \simeq c - n$ between the gating variables $h$ and $n$ of the 4D HH model, where $c$ is a constant, which suggests an interdependence between the dynamics of Na$^+$ and K$^+$ transmembrane voltage-gated channels. We derive the corresponding cable equations for the three HH-type models and demonstrate that the action potential propagates along the axon at a speed described by $v(R, C_m) = \alpha / (C_m R^{\beta}) = \gamma D^{\beta}$, where $\alpha &gt; 0$, $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1$, and $\gamma$ are constants independent of the local stimulus intensity, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the electric signal along the axon, $C_m$ is the axon transmembrane capacitance, and $R$ is the axon conducting resistivity. The width $w$ of the action potential spikes is inversely related to the resistivity of the axon, with $w = \alpha_2 / R^{\beta_2}$, where $\alpha_2 &gt; 0$ and $\beta_2 &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Computing Pipeline for Real World Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional investigations by developing \rev{a hybrid} quantum computing pipeline tailored to address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the application of quantum computation in drug discovery and propels it towards more scalable system. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug design workflows.</description>
