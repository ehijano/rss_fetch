      <title>The MIST-1 and MIST-2 multicusp ion sources for high-current H$_2^+$ beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two iterations of the Multicusp Ion Source Technology at MIT (MIST) sources, designed to fulfill the requirements of the HCHC-XX cyclotron design. The HCHC-XX is a novel compact cyclotron accelerating H$_2^+$. Beam is injected through a radio-frequency quadrupole buncher-accelerator (embedded in the cyclotron yoke) and utilizes so-called vortex motion during acceleration. If successful, it will deliver 10 mA of protons at 60 MeV in CW mode. This scheme requires a low-emittance, high-current initial beam with high H$_2^+$ purity. We briefly summarize the design and previous results of the MIST-1 ion source and, for the first time, the detailed design of the new and improved MIST-2, including the mechanical, electrical, and control system design. We further show experimental results of using the MIST-2 backplate on the MIST-1 body, present a study using different types of permanent magnets for confinement (including no magnets), and finally, we present first results of the MIST-2 in full operation. In this first commissioning run, we were able to increase the total extracted current from the MIST-2 to 7 mA - a factor of 2 over the MIST-1.</description>

      <title>Aperture limitation localization using beam position and beam loss monitor measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of beam injection in circular accelerators can be impacted by unknown aperture limitations in the vacuum chamber. These limitations can be detected by introducing localized distortions to the closed orbit of the circulating beam observed at beam position monitors (BPMs). The localized nature of introduced closed orbit distortions enables targeted identification of loss regions. In this paper, we present a method for localizing beam losses designed primarily for circular electron accelerators using a set of sequentially placed scintillator-based beam loss monitors (BLMs). By moving these monitors along the accelerator lattice, the proposed technique achieves sub-meter spatial resolution in beam loss localization. Relative calibration of the BLMs was performed using a strontium-90 radioactive source. We report experimental results from the implementation of this method at the VEPP-4M collider.</description>

      <title>Analytical and Numerical Studies of Dark Current in Radiofrequency Structures for Short-Pulse High-Gradient Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-gradient acceleration is a key research area that could enable compact linear accelerators for future colliders, light sources, and other applications. In the pursuit of high-gradient operation, RF breakdown limits the attainable accelerating gradient in normal-conducting RF structures. Recent experiments at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator suggest a promising approach: using short RF pulses with durations of a few nanoseconds. Experimental studies show that these O(1 ns) RF pulses can mitigate breakdown limitations, resulting in higher gradients. For example, an electric field of nearly 400 MV/m was achieved in an X-band photoemission gun driven by 6-ns-long RF pulses, with rapid RF conditioning and low dark current observed. Despite these promising results, the short-pulse regime remains an under-explored parameter space, and RF breakdown physics under nanosecond-long pulses requires further investigation. In this paper, we present analytical and numerical simulations of dark current dynamics in accelerating cavities operating in the short-pulse regime. We study breakdown-associated processes spanning different time scales, including field emission, multipacting, and plasma formation, using simulations of the X-band photogun cavities. The results reveal the advantages of using short RF pulses to reduce dark current and mitigate RF breakdown, offering a path toward a new class of compact accelerators with enhanced performance and reduced susceptibility to breakdown.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is vital for developing powerful ultrashort light sources. We introduce a CSR generation mechanism using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons, causing them to emit CSR in the Valilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. The harmonics can be well isolated for a high charge beam. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance of electrodynamics in radio-frequency linear accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study discusses the scale transformation of electromagnetic fields and trajectories of ions in radio-frequency linear accelerators. We will obtain a condition for mechanical similarity, where Maxwell equations with source terms and the equation of motion under Lorentz force remain invariant, including space charge fields, while the trajectories of ions are accordingly scaled. The possibility of linear accelerators for extremely high current beams will be considered based on this condition.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies on compensation for incoherent magnet error driven half-integer and 3rd-order resonances with space charge in HIAF-BRing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnet error driven resonances under space-charge-induced resonance crossing represents a significant limitation on beam intensity in low-injection-energy high-intensity synchrotrons. Unstable particle motion arises from the combined effects of space-charge-induced tune spread and magnetic field imperfections, which limits the intensity. This paper introduces a space-charge-Twiss modification to the Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs). The new RDTs are named modified RDTs. Modified RDTs aim to describe the nonlinear behavior under incoherent error driven resonances induced by the combined effect of space charge and magnetic field imperfections. The feasibility of the compensation scheme with modified RDTs is demonstrated through coasting-beam simulations under space-charge-induced half-integer and 3rd-order resonances, using the lattice of the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator Facility Booster Ring (HIAF-BRing). The simulations demonstrate that the compensation through minimizing modified RDTs significantly suppresses the emittance growth and the unstable particle motion. Besides, the effect of compensation scheme with modified RDTs against periodical resonance crossing is evaluated in bunched-beam simulations.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Wavefront Sensing using Optical Masking Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave front sensing of the surface of equal phase for a propagating electromagnetic wave is a vital technology in fields ranging from real time adaptive optics, to high accuracy metrology, to medical optometry. We have developed a new method of wavefront sensing that makes a direct measurement of the electromagnetic phase distribution, or path-length delay, across an optical wavefront. The method is based on techniques developed in radio astronomical interferometric imaging. The method employs optical interferometry using a 2-D aperture mask, a Fourier transform of the interferogram to derive interferometric visibilities, and self-calibration of the complex visibilities to derive the voltage amplitude and phase gains at each hole in the mask, corresponding to corrections for non-uniform illumination and wavefront distortions across the aperture, respectively. The derived self-calibration gain phases are linearly proportional to the electromagnetic path-length distribution to each hole in the aperture mask, relative to the path-length to the reference hole, and hence represent a wavefront sensor with a precision of a small fraction of a wavelength. The method was tested at $\lambda=400\,$nm at the Xanadu optical bench at the ALBA synchrotron light source using a rotating mirror to insert tip-tilt changes in the wavefront. We reproduce the wavefront tilts to within $0.1''$ ($5\times 10^{-7}$~radians). We also derive the static metrology though the optical system for non-planar wavefront distortions to $\sim \pm1$~nm repeatability. Lastly, we derive frame-to-frame variations of the wavefront tilt due to vibrations of the optical components which range up to $\sim 0.5"$. These variations are relevant to adaptive optics applications. Based on the measured visibility phase noise after self-calibration, we estimate an rms path-length precision per 1~ms exposure of 0.6 nm.</description>
