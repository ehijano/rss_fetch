      <title>From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation I: Tracing the Brussels Group's Intellectual Journey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics proposes that quantum entities have a conceptual nature, interacting with the material world through processes that are the physical counterpart of the meaning-based processes which typically occur in human cognition. This interpretation emerged from the early developments in quantum cognition, a field that uses quantum mathematics to model human cognitive activity. It benefited from the specific approach taken by the Brussels research group, modeling concepts themselves as quantum entities and minds as measuring apparatuses. The article sketches the essential steps of the intellectual journey going from the first applications of quantum notions and formalisms to human cognition to the proposal of a potentially groundbreaking interpretation of quantum mechanics, offering profound explanations for major quantum phenomena. This was done by drawing numerous parallels with the human conceptual domain and suggesting the existence of a level of cognitive activity that would underlie our physical reality. This means that an increased cross-fertilization between the conceptuality interpretation and quantum cognition is to be expected in the future, both of which are synergistic in furthering our understanding of the nature of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article. In the second part, which can be read independently of the first, the successes of the interpretation will be described in a more systematic way, providing a brief overview of what has been achieved so far.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words detection of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Grass of the Universe: Rethinking Technosphere, Planetary History, and Sustainability with Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SETI is not a usual point of departure for environmental humanities. However, this paper argues that theories originating in this field have direct implications for how we think about viable inhabitation of the Earth. To demonstrate SETI's impact on environmental humanities, this paper introduces Fermi paradox as a speculative tool to probe possible trajectories of planetary history, and especially the "Sustainability Solution" proposed by Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum. This solution suggests that sustainable coupling between extraterrestrial intelligences and their planetary environments is the major factor in the possibility of their successful detection by remote observation. By positing that exponential growth is not a sustainable development pattern, this solution rules out space-faring civilizations colonizing solar systems or galaxies. This paper elaborates on Haqq-Misra's and Baum's arguments, and discusses speculative implications of the Sustainability Solution, thus rethinking three concepts in environmental humanities: technosphere, planetary history, and sustainability. The paper advocates that (1) technosphere is a transitory layer that shall fold back into biosphere; (2) planetary history must be understood in a generic perspective that abstracts from terrestrial particularities; and (3) sustainability is not sufficient vector of viable human inhabitation of the Earth, suggesting instead habitability and genesity as better candidates.</description>
