      <title>The development of vibration modes propagation method to perform wave-optics simulation of beamline vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution from 3rd to 4th generation synchrotron radiation (SR) sources provide promising potential improvements in X-ray techniques, particularly in spatial resolution for imaging, temporal resolution for dynamic studies, and beam size control for nanoprobes. Achieving these enhancements demands effective vibration suppression in beamline systems. This challenge drives the need for optical designs that ensure efficient photon transport while maintaining vibration within acceptable thresholds. To address the advanced coherence requirements of fourth-generation SR sources, wave-optics simulations must be incorporated into optical design processes. We therefore propose a vibration mode propagation method using wave-optics techniques for beamline vibration simulation. Our approach achieves an almost 40-fold computational acceleration in actual beamline models compared to conventional methods, enabling direct analysis of propagating wavefront vibrations. This framework allows systematic evaluation of intensity distribution variations, coherence changes, and beam positioning errors caused by mechanical vibrations.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Schottky Diagnostics for Low-SNR Betatron Tune Measurement in Ramping Synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel real-time betatron tune measurement algorithm, utilizing Schottky signals and an FPGA-based backend architecture, specifically designed for rapidly ramping synchrotrons, with particular application to the Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy (SAPT) facility. The developed algorithm demonstrates improved measurement accuracy under challenging operational conditions, especially in scenarios with limited sampling time and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as \(-20\) dB. By applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, the algorithm effectively accommodates the rapid increase in revolution frequency from 4 MHz to 7.5 MHz over 0.35 seconds, along with tune shifts. A macro-particle simulation methodology is employed to generate Schottky signals, which are then combined with real noise collected from an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to simulate practical conditions. The proposed betatron tune measurement algorithm integrates advanced spectral processing techniques and an enhanced peak detection algorithm specifically tailored for low SNR conditions. Experimental validation confirms the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over conventional approaches in terms of measurement accuracy, stability, and system robustness, while meeting the stringent operational requirements of proton therapy applications. This innovative approach effectively addresses critical limitations associated with Schottky diagnostics for betatron tune measurement in rapidly ramping synchrotrons operating under low SNR conditions, laying a robust foundation and providing a viable solution for advanced applications in proton therapy and related accelerator physics fields.</description>
