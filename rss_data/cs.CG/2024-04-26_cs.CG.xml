      <title>On Approximating the Dynamic and Discrete Network Flow Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamic network flow problem under the assumption that the flow consists of discrete units. The dynamic network flow problem is commonly addressed in the context of developing evacuation plans, where the flow is typically treated as a continuous quantity. However, real-world scenarios often involve moving groups, such as families, as single units. We demonstrate that solving the dynamic flow problem with this consideration is APX-hard. Conversely, we present a PTAS for instances where the base graph is a path with a constant number of nodes. We introduce a `ready time' constraint to the minsum bin packing problem, meaning certain items cannot be placed in specific bins, develop a PTAS for this modified problem, and apply our algorithms to the discrete and dynamic flow problem.</description>

      <title>Constrained Level Planarity is FPT with Respect to the Vertex Cover Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem Level Planarity asks for a crossing-free drawing of a graph in the plane such that vertices are placed at prescribed y-coordinates (called levels) and such that every edge is realized as a y-monotone curve. In the variant Constrained Level Planarity, each level y is equipped with a partial order &lt;_y on its vertices and in the desired drawing the left-to-right order of vertices on level y has to be a linear extension of &lt;_y. Constrained Level Planarity is known to be a remarkably difficult problem: previous results by Klemz and Rote [ACM Trans. Alg. 2019] and by Br\"uckner and Rutter [SODA 2017] imply that it remains NP-hard even when restricted to graphs whose tree-depth and feedback vertex set number are bounded by a constant and even when the instances are additionally required to be either proper, meaning that each edge spans two consecutive levels, or ordered, meaning that all given partial orders are total orders. In particular, these results rule out the existence of FPT-time (even XP-time) algorithms with respect to these and related graph parameters (unless P=NP). However, the parameterized complexity of Constrained Level Planarity with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graph remained open.
  In this paper, we show that Constrained Level Planarity can be solved in FPT-time when parameterized by the vertex cover number. In view of the previous intractability statements, our result is best-possible in several regards: a speed-up to polynomial time or a generalization to the aforementioned smaller graph parameters is not possible, even if restricting to proper or ordered instances.</description>

      <title>Framework for $\exists \mathbb{R}$-Completeness of Two-Dimensional Packing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim in packing problems is to decide if a given set of pieces can be placed inside a given container. A packing problem is defined by the types of pieces and containers to be handled, and the motions that are allowed to move the pieces. The pieces must be placed so that in the resulting placement, they are pairwise interior-disjoint. We establish a framework which enables us to show that for many combinations of allowed pieces, containers and motions, the resulting problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete. This means that the problem is equivalent (under polynomial time reductions) to deciding whether a given system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a real solution.
  We consider packing problems where only translations are allowed as the motions, and problems where arbitrary rigid motions are allowed, i.e., both translations and rotations. When rotations are allowed, we show that it is an $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete problem to decide if a set of convex polygons, each of which has at most $7$ corners, can be packed into a square. Restricted to translations, we show that the following problems are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete: (i) pieces bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves to be packed in a square, and (ii) convex polygons to be packed in a container bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves.</description>

      <title>Stable Homology-Based Cycle Centrality Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05565</link>

Abstract: Network centrality measures play a crucial role in understanding graph structures, assessing the importance of nodes, paths, or cycles based on directed or reciprocal interactions encoded by vertices and edges. Estrada and Ross extended these measures to simplicial complexes to account for higher-order connections. In this work, we introduce novel centrality measures by leveraging algebraically-computable topological signatures of cycles and their homological persistence. We apply tools from algebraic topology to extract multiscale signatures within cycle spaces of weighted graphs, tracking homology generators persisting across a weight-induced filtration of simplicial complexes built over point clouds. This approach incorporates persistent signatures and merge information of homology classes along the filtration, quantifying cycle importance not only by geometric and topological significance but also by homological influence on other cycles. We demonstrate the stability of these measures under small perturbations using an appropriate metric to ensure robustness in practical applications. Finally, we apply these measures to fractal-like point clouds, revealing their capability to detect information consistent with, and possibly overlooked by, common topological summaries.</description>
