      <title>Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Nonlinear Transport in a Floquet-Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic laser driving, known as Floquet engineering, is a powerful tool to manipulate the properties of quantum materials. Using circularly polarized light, artificial magnetic fields, called Berry curvature, can be created in the photon-dressed Floquet-Bloch states that form. This mechanism, when applied to 3D Dirac and Weyl systems, is predicted to lead to photon-dressed movement of Weyl nodes which should be detectable in the transport sector. The transport response of such a topological light-matter hybrid, however, remains experimentally unknown. Here, we report on the transport properties of the type-II Weyl semimetal T$\mathrm{_d}$-MoTe$_\mathrm{2}$ illuminated by a femtosecond pulse of circularly polarized light. Using an ultrafast optoelectronic device architecture, we observed injection currents and a helicity-dependent anomalous Hall effect whose scaling with laser field strongly deviate from the perturbative laws of nonlinear optics. We show using Floquet theory that this discovery corresponds to the formation of a magnetic Floquet-Weyl semimetal state. Numerical ab initio simulations support this interpretation, indicating that the light-induced motion of the Weyl nodes contributes substantially to the measured transport signals. This work demonstrates the ability to generate large effective magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 30T) with light, which can be used to manipulate the magnetic and topological properties of a range of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>On a Solution to the Dirac Equation with a Triangular Potential Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral anomalies resulting from the breaking of classical symmetries at the quantum level are fundamental to quantum field theory and gaining ever-growing importance in the description of topological materials in condensed matter physics. Here we present analytical solutions of the Dirac equation for massless 3+1 fermions confined to an infinite stripe and placed into a background gauge field forming a triangular potential well across the width of the stripe. Such an effective 1+1 system hosts zero-energy modes resulting in the gauge field-dependent chiral anomaly structure. This problem has a direct relation to a half-bearded graphene nanoribbon placed into an in-plane external electric field and offers it an exact solution in terms of new special functions that are similar but not reducible to Airy functions.</description>

      <title>Carbon nanotube as quantum point contact valley-filter and valley-splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical characteristics of a carbon nanotube can be significantly modified by applying elastic strain. This study focuses on exploring this phenomenon in a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) using tight-binding transport calculations. The results indicate that, under specific strains, an armchair SWNT can act as a filter, separating the two valley electrons K and Kp. Notably, when subjected to deformation, the SWNT exhibits intriguing behaviors, including a quantized conductance profile that varies with the strength of the strain. Consequently, precise control of the width of the quantized plateaus allows for the generation of a polarized valley current. Furthermore, when both K-types are conducted, the strain is demonstrated to completely separate them, directing each K-type through a distinct pathway.</description>

      <title>Bipolar Fabry-P\'erot charge interferometer in periodically electron-irradiated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron optics deals with the wave-nature of charge carriers to induce, investigate and exploit coherent phenomena in solid state devices, in analogy with optics and photonics. Typically, these goals are achieved in complex electronic devices taking advantage of the macroscopically coherent charge transport in two dimensional electron gases and superconductors. Here, we demonstrate a simple counterintuitive architecture employing intentionally-created lattice defects to induce collective coherent effects in the charge transport of graphene. More specifically, multiple Fabry-P\'erot cavities are produced by irradiating graphene via low-energy electron-beam to form periodically alternated defective and pristine nano-stripes. The enhanced hole-doping in the defective stripes creates potential barriers behaving as partially reflecting mirrors and resonantly confining the carrier-waves within the pristine areas. The interference effects are both theoretically and experimentally investigated and manifest as sheet resistance oscillations up to 30 K for both polarities of charge carriers, contrarily to traditional electrostatically-created Fabry-P\'erot interferometers. Our findings propose defective graphene as an original platform for the realization of innovative coherent electronic devices with applications in nano and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dielectric and optical markers originated from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate that practically all the non-excitonic dielectric and optical properties of semiconductors and insulators are determined by the quantum metric of the valence band states, including charge susceptibility, relative dielectric constant, optical conductivity, dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, reflectance, and transmittance. The key to this recognition is the complex optical conductivity, which contains the quantum metric in the optical transition matrix element, and the fact that all these dielectric and optical properties can be expressed in terms of the real and imaginary parts of optical conductivity. Our formalism allows to map all these properties to real space lattice sites as local markers following the formalism of topological markers, enabling the effect of disorder on the propagation of electromagnetic wave in the nanometer scale to be investigated, as demonstrated by a minimal model of 3D topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable negative differential resistance in multifunctional van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as leading candidates for the development of low-power and multifunctional computing applications, thanks to their qualities such as layer-dependent band gap tunability, high carrier mobility, and excellent electrostatic control. Here, we explore a pair of 2D semiconductors with broken-gap (Type III) band alignment and demonstrate a highly gate-tunable p-MoTe$_{2}$/n-SnS$_{2}$ heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistor with multifunctional behavior. Employing a dual-gated asymmetric device geometry, we unveil its functionality as both a forward and backward rectifying device. Consequently, we observe a highly gate-tunable negative differential resistance (NDR), with a gate-coupling efficiency of $\eta \simeq 0.5$ and a peak-to-valley ratio of $\sim$ 3 down to 150K. By employing density functional theory and exploring the density of states, we determine that interband tunneling within the valence bands is the cause of the observed NDR characteristics. The combination of band-to-band tunneling and gate controllability of NDR signal open the pathway for realizing gate-tunable 2D material-based neuromorphic and energy-efficient electronics.</description>

      <title>Quantum intrinsic ${\cal T}$-odd spin Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drude weight, historically associated with the longitudinal Drude conductivity, can be generalized to describe the transverse or Hall component of the extrinsic conductivity tensor. In particular, transverse Drude weights, such as band geometric quantities Berry curvature dipole and spin vorticity, manifest themselves through the \textit{extrinsic} second-order nonlinear Hall effect and \textit{extrinsic} linear spin Hall effect (SHE) in diffusive transport, respectively. In this work, we uncover a new class of intrinsic Hall effects in quantum transport regime, termed as quantum intrinsic Hall effect (QIHE), which is the manifestation of system symmetry through intrinsic transport phenomena. For a given Hamiltonian, its transport characteristics can be revealed either intrinsically through QIHE in ballistic regime or extrinsically via the transverse Drude weight in diffusive transport, where both intrinsic and extrinsic effects share the same salient transport features governed by symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The physical origin of QIHE is attributed to quantum boundary scattering of the measurement setup that respects the system symmetry, as exemplified by the contact resistance of a two-terminal ballistic conductor. We demonstrate our finding by studying the quantum ${\cal T}$-odd ($\mathcal{T}$, time-reversal) SHE in altermagnets. Our work paves a way towards the quantum transport manifestation of band geometric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystalline 30$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer graphene: Fractal patterns and electronic localization properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently synthesized 30$^\circ$ twisted bilayer graphene (30$^\circ$-TBG) systems are unique quasicrystal systems possessing dodecagonal symmetry with graphene's relativistic properties.
  We employ a real-space numerical atomistic framework that respects both the dodecagonal rotational symmetry and the massless Dirac nature of the electrons to describe the local density of states of the system.
  The approach we employ is very efficiency for systems with very large unit cells and does not rely on periodic boundary conditions. These features allow us to address a broad class of multilayer two-dimensional crystal with incommensurate configurations, particularly TBGs. Our results reveal that the 30$^\circ$-TBG electronic spectrum consist of extended states together with a set of localized wave functions. The localized states exhibit fractal patterns consistent with the quasicrystal tiling.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.</description>

      <title>Twisted bilayer graphene for enantiomeric sensing of chiral molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective sensing of chiral molecules is a key aspect in fields spanning biology, chemistry, and pharmacology. However, conventional optical methods, such as circular dichroism (CD), encounter limitations owing to weak chiral light-matter interactions. Several strategies have been investigated to enhance CD or circularly polarised luminescence (CPL), including superchiral light, plasmonic nanoresonators and dielectric nanostructures. However, a compromise between spatial uniformity and high sensitivity, without requiring specific molecular functionalization, remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel approach using twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), a chiral 2D material with a strong CD peak which energy is tunable through the twist angle. By matching the CD resonance of TBG with the optical transition energy of the molecule, we achieve a decay rate enhancement mediated by resonant energy transfer that depends on the electric-magnetic interaction, that is, on the chirality of both the molecules and TBG. This leads to an enantioselective quenching of the molecule fluorescence, allowing to retrieve the molecule chirality from time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. This method demonstrates high sensitivity down to single layer of molecules, with the potential to achieve the ultimate goal of single-molecule chirality sensing, while preserving the spatial uniformity and integrability of 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb blockade oscillations in transport and thermodynamic properties of a mesoscopic device having multiple charging energy modes. This setup can be realized using a nanoelectronic circuit comprising coupled hybrid metal-semiconductor islands. We show that this device can have various distinctive operational regimes depending on the strength of charging modes and base temperature. We focus on three different regimes; quantum regime, thermal regime and quantum-thermal mixed regime, in which the shape of the Coulomb blockade oscillations manifests well-defined features that can be accessed via conductance measurements. Our theory covers full crossover among these regimes, and also accounts for an accidental vanishing of one of the charging modes.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of boundary criticality and exotic topological semimetals in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently found that, going beyond the tendfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and violating the bulk-boundary correspondence of the usual topological phases, PT-invariant systems support a real Chern insulator with the so-called boundary criticality, which forbids the transition between different orders of topological phases accompanied by the closing and reopening of the bulk-band gap. Here, we fnd that the periodic driving can break the boundary criticality of a PT-invariant system. Setting free from the the boundary criticality, diverse first- and second-order topological phases absent in the static case are found in both the zero and Pi/T modes. The application of our result in the three-dimensional PT-invariant system permits us to discover exotic second-order Dirac and nodal-line semimetals with coexisting surface and hinge Fermi arcs. Enriching the family of the topological phases in PT-invariant systems, our result provides us a useful way to explore novel topological phases.</description>

      <title>Thermal with Electronic Excitation for the Unidirectional Rotation of a Molecule on Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the limits of the microscopic reversibility principle, we investigated the interplay between thermal and electron tunneling excitations for the unidirectional rotation of a molecule-rotor on the Au(111) surface. We identified a range of moderate voltages and temperatures where heating the surface enhances the unidirectional rotational rate of a chemisorbed DMNI-P rotor. At higher voltage, inelastic tunneling effects dominate while at higher temperature the process becomes stochastic. At each electron transfer event during tunneling, the quantum mixing of ground and excited electronic states brings part of the surface thermal energy in the excited electronic states of the molecule-rotor. Thermal energy contributes therefore to the semi-classical unidirectional rotation without contradicting the microscopic reversibility principle.</description>

      <title>Influence of Coulomb interaction on interband photogalvanic effect in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ballistic and shift contributions to the interband linear photogalvanic effect are calculated in the same band structure model of a noncentrosymmetric semiconductor. The calculation uses a two-band generalized Dirac effective Hamiltonian with the off-diagonal components containing $\mathbf{ k}$-dependent terms of the first and second order. The developed theory takes into account the Coulomb interaction between the photoexited electron and hole. It is shown that in typical semiconductors the ballistic photocurrent $j^{({\rm bal})}$ significantly exceeds the shift current $j^{({\rm sh})}$: the ratio $j^{({\rm sh})}/j^{({\rm bal})}$ has the order of $a_B/ \ell$, where $a_B$ is the Bohr radius and $\ell$ is the mean free path of photocarriers due to their quasi-momentum scattering.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian noise from quasiparticle poisoning in electron transport through a pair of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological qubits based on non-abelian Majorana bound states (MBSs) are protected by parity which is challenged by quasiparticle poisoning (QPP). In this work, we show how QPP affects transport through a pair of coupled MBSs weakly connected to two current leads, using an open system approach and full counting statistics. We find that the correct low-energy physics requires to include next to leading order tunneling events in the coupling to the leads. In particular, our results show that QPP causes super-Poissonian local shot noise with a Fano factor that diverges with decreasing bias voltage, while the current and the non-local (cross-)noise are only little affected. We explain that these features are a direct consequence of the nature of MBSs being their own antiparticle making noise measurements a viable tool to search for MBSs in the presence of QPP.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of alpha-gallium probed on the atomic scale by normal and Josephson tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate superconducting gallium in its $\alpha$ phase using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at temperatures down to about 100 mK. High-resolution tunneling spectroscopies using both superconducting and normal tips show that superconducting $\alpha$-Ga is accurately described by Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, with a gap $\Delta_{\rm Ga}$ = 163 $\mu$eV on the $\alpha-$Ga(112) facet, with highly homogeneous spectra over the surface, including atomic defects and step edges. Using a superconducting Pb tip, we furthermore study the low-bias conductance features of the Josephson junction formed between tip and sample. The features are accurately described by dynamical Coulomb blockade theory, highlighting $\alpha-$Ga as a possible platform for surface science studies of mesoscopic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Autonomous demon exploiting heat and information at the trajectory level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an electronic bipartite system consisting of a working substance, in which a refrigeration process is implemented, and of a nonthermal resource region, containing a combination of different thermal baths. In the working substance, heat is extracted from the coldest of two electronic reservoirs (refrigeration) via heat- and particle transport through a quantum dot. This quantum dot of the working substance is capacitively coupled to the resource region. In such a setup, a finite cooling power can be obtained in the working substance, while the energy exchange with the resource region exactly cancels out on average. At the same time, information is always exchanged, even on average, due to the capacitive coupling between the two parts of the bipartite system. The proposed system therefore implements an autonomous demon with fully vanishing heat extraction from the resource. Unlike macroscopic machines, nanoscale machines exhibit large fluctuations in performance, so precision becomes an important performance quantifier. We give a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic performance of the proposed autonomous demon in terms of stochastic trajectories and of full counting statistics and demonstrate that the precision of the cooling power strongly depends on the operation principle of the device. More specifically, the interplay of information flow and counter-balancing heat flows dramatically impacts the trade-off between cooling power, efficiency, and precision. We expect this insight to be of relevance for guiding the design of energy-conversion processes exploiting nonthermal resources.</description>

      <title>Recognizing molecular chirality via twisted 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality pervades natural processes from the atomic to the cosmic scales, crucially impacting molecular chemistry and pharmaceutics. Traditional chirality sensing methods face challenges in sensitivity and efficiency, prompting the quest of novel chiral recognition solutions based on nanophotonics. In this work we theoretically investigate the possibility to carry out enantiomeric discrimination by measuring the spontaneous emission rate of chiral molecules on twisted two-dimensional materials. We first present a general theoretical framework based on dyadic Green's functions to calculate the chiral contribution to the decay rate in the presence of a generic chiral bilayer interface. We then combine this theory with density functional theory to obtain numerical estimates of the decay rate of helical bilayer nanographene molecules placed on top of twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Finite-size topological phases from semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05842v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>

      <title>Anomalous multi-gap topological phases in periodically driven quantum rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven quantum rotors provide a promising and broadly applicable platform to implement multi-gap topological phases, where groups of bands can acquire topological invariants due to non-Abelian braiding of band degeneracies. By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.</description>

      <title>Bias-Field Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Higher-Order Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. Combinatorial optimization plays a crucial role in many industrial applications, yet classical computing often struggles with complex instances. By encoding these problems as Ising spin glasses and leveraging the advancements in quantum computing technologies, quantum optimization methods emerge as a promising alternative. We apply BF-DCQO with an enhanced bias term to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model. Our protocol is experimentally validated using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor with a heavy-hex architecture. In the studied instances, the results outperform standard methods, including the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we perform an MPS simulation and provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Both studied cases, the experiment on 156 qubits and the simulation on 433 qubits, can be considered as the start of the commercial quantum advantage era, Kipu dixit, and even more when extended soon to denser industry-level HUBO problems.</description>

      <title>Lattice thermal conductivity and phonon properties of polycrystalline graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using spectral energy density method, we predict the phonon scattering mean lifetimes of polycrystalline graphene (PC-G) having polycrystallinity only along $\rm{x}$-axis with seven different misorientation (tilt) angles at room temperature. Contrary to other studies on PC-G samples, our results indicate strong dependence of the thermal conductivity (TC) on the tilt angles. We also show that the square of the group velocity components along $\rm{x}$ and $\rm{y}$ axes and the phonon lifetimes are uncorrelated and the phonon density of states are almost the same for all samples with different tilt angles. Further, a distribution of the group velocity component along $\rm{x}$ or $\rm{y}$ axis as function of normal frequency is found to be exponentially decaying whereas that of phonon lifetime showed piecewise constant function behavior with respect to frequency. We provide parameters for these distribution functions and suggest another measure of the TC based on these distributions. Finally, we perform a size-dependent analysis for two tilt angles, $21.78^\circ$ and $32.20^\circ$, and find that bulk TC components decrease by around 34% to 62% in comparison to the bulk TC values of the pristine graphene. Our analysis reveals intriguing insights into the interplay between grain orientation, phonon scattering and thermal conductivity in graphene.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated superthermal phonon correlations in the ultrastrong coupling regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonons, or vibrational quanta, are behind some of the most fundamental physical phenomena in solids, including superconductivity, Raman processes, and broken-symmetry phases. It is therefore of fundamental importance to find ways to harness phonons for controlling these phenomena and developing novel quantum technologies. However, the majority of current phonon control techniques rely on the use of intense external driving fields or strong anharmonicities, which restricts their range of applications. Here, we present a scheme for controlling the intensity fluctuations in phonon emission at room temperature based on multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling. The multimode ultrastrong coupling regime is achieved by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to an array of nanoslots, which operates as a single-mode cavity. The extremely small mode volume of the nanoslots enables unprecedented coupling strengths in a cavity phonon-polariton system. In the far-detuned, low-cavity-frequency regime, we demonstrate that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective coupling between the phonon modes, resulting in superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium, both within the same mode and between different modes. Experimental results are in good agreement with a multimode Hopfield model. Our work paves the way for the tailoring of phonons to modify charge and energy transport in perovskite materials, with potential applications in light-collecting or emitting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of time-dynamics and thermal states of free fermions on N = 2^n modes are known to require poly(2^n) computational classical resources. We present several such free fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly(n) cost. The key technique is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. We prove that the problem of free fermion time-dynamics is BQP-complete, thus ensuring a general exponential speedup of our approach.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Tuning of the Anomalous Hall Effect in Altermagnetic MnTe Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) sensitive to the magnetic state of antiferromagnets can trigger a new era of spintronics, if materials that host a tunable and strong AHE are identified. Altermagnets are a new class of materials that can under certain conditions manifest a strong AHE, without having a net magnetization. But the ability to control their AHE is still lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that the AHE in altermagnetic {\alpha}-MnTe grown on GaAs(111) substrates can be "written on-demand" by cooling the material under an in-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field controls the strength and the coercivity of the AHE. Remarkably, this control is unique to {\alpha}-MnTe grown on GaAs and is absent in {\alpha}-MnTe grown on SrF2. The tunability that we reveal challenges our current understanding of the symmetry-allowed AHE in this material and opens new possibilities for the design of altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe2 Nanojunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity in topological materials can lead to innovative electronic phases and device functionalities. Here, we present a new strategy for quantum engineering of superconducting junctions in moire materials through direct, on-chip, and fully encapsulated 2D crystal growth. We achieve robust and designable superconductivity in Pd-metalized twisted bilayer molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and observe anomalous superconducting effects in high-quality junctions across ~ 20 moire cells. Surprisingly, the junction develops enhanced, instead of weakened, superconducting behaviors, exhibiting fluctuations to a higher critical magnetic field compared to its adjacent Pd7MoTe2 superconductor. Additionally, the critical current further exhibits a striking V-shaped minimum at zero magnetic field. These features are unexpected in conventional Josephson junctions and indeed absent in junctions of natural bilayer MoTe2 created using the same approach. We discuss implications of these observations, including the possible formation of mixed even- and odd-parity superconductivity at the moire junctions. Our results also demonstrate a pathway to engineer and investigate superconductivity in fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Stripe and Bubble Ratchets on Asymmetric Substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a variety of non-monotonic ratchet effects can arise when mesophase pattern-forming systems, which exhibit anisotropic crystal, stripe, and bubble reigmes, are coupled to one-dimensional asymmetric substrates under ac driving. The ratchet efficiency and direction of motion are determined by how well the mesophase morphology matches the periodicity and shape of the substrate. Stripe states that are aligned with the substrate show the strongest ratchet effect, large bubbles show a weak ratchet effect, and small bubbles show a strong ratchet effect with an efficiency that oscillates as a function of ac drive amplitude. We map out the different rectification phases as a function of the pattern morphology, substrate strength, and ac drive amplitude. The pronounced ratchet effects that we observe in some regimes can be exploited for pattern sorting in hard and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>High-quality hexagonal boron nitride selectively grown on patterned epigraphene by MOVPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation is the method of choice for protecting graphene from environmental doping and impurity scattering. It was previously demonstrated that metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) grows epitaxially ordered, uniform BN layers on epigraphene (graphene grown on SiC). Due to graphene non-wetting properties, h-BN growth starts preferentially from the graphene ledges. We use this fact here to selectively promote growth of high-quality flat h-BN on epigraphene by patterning epigraphene microstructures prior to BN growth. Thin h-BN films (down to 6 nm) grown by MOVPE show smooth and pleated surface morphology on epigraphene, while crumpled BN is observed on the SiC. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and fluorescence imaging confirm the higher BN quality grown on the epigraphene. Transport measurements reveal p-doping as expected from hydrogen intercalation of epigraphene and regions of high and low mobility. This method can be used to produce structurally uniform high-quality h-BN/epigraphene micro/nano scale heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dichroism in darkfield UV photoemission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has evolved into an indispensable tool for structural and magnetic characterization of surfaces at the nanometer scale. In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.</description>

      <title>FePd2Te2: An Anisotropic Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet with One-Dimensional Fe Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets have attracted significant attentions in recent years due to their importance in the research on both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. Here, we report the discovery of a new ternary compound FePd2Te2. It features a layered quasi-2D crystal structure with one-dimensional Fe zigzag chains extending along the b-axis in the cleavage plane. Single crystals of FePd2Te2 with centimeter-size could be grown. Density functional theory calculations, mechanical exfoliation and atomic force microscopy on these crystals reveal that they are 2D materialsthat can be thinned down to 5 nm. Magnetic characterization shows that FePd2Te2 is an easy-plane ferromagnet with Tc 183 K and strong in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect demonstrate that ferromagnetism could maintain in FePd2Te2 flakes with large coercivity. A crystal twinning effect is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy which makes the Fe chains right-angle bent in the cleavage plane and creates an intriguing spin texture. Our results show that FePd2Te2 is a correlated anisotropic 2D magnets that may attract multidisciplinary research interests.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall supercurrent and {\delta}{\phi}-shift in the topological Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Josephson junctions comprising superconductors and ferromagnets on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators. We use Bogoliubov-deGennes formalism and show the in-plane magnetization creates a difference between the upward and downward population of Andreev modes and produces a planar Hall supercurrent. Due to the strong spin-orbit interaction of Dirac fermions, bending on the supercurrent imposes a spin transfer torque on the junction. We develop a theory and demonstrate the relation between planar Hall supercurrent and spin transfer torque. The parallel component of in-plane magnetization creates an anomalous supercurrent that can flow even in zero superconducting phase difference and make $\delta\phi$-junction. We show in some range,$\pi/2d \leq m_y \leq \pi/d$, there is a $\pi$ shift in the Josephson supercurrent. This research advances our understanding of quantum transport in 3DTIs and highlights their potential in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain in 2D TMDCs induced by metal-assisted exfoliation from the polyvinilalcohol-covered substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have modified the metal-assisted transfer technique to obtain large-area few-layer flakes from transition metal dichalcogenides bulk crystals by introducing an initial stage - exfoliation of the bulk crystal onto an intermediate substrate, specifically a silicon wafer coated with polyvinyl alcohol. Following this, we thermally evaporate silver onto the sample and transfer the top layers of the crystal along with the silver layer to the target substrate. This technique allows the production of visually non-corrugated single- and few-layer flakes with high yield. A direct comparison of the micro-Raman and micro-photoluminescence spectra of flakes exfoliated using our method with the spectra of those exfoliated from scotch tape reveals differences in their properties. We identify signatures of deformations in the flakes exfoliated from the intermediate substrate, indicating the presence of static friction between the substrate and the flake. Our findings thus suggest a novel method to induce intrinsic deformation in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Edge-driven transition between extended quantum anomalous Hall crystal and fractional Chern insulator in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with fractionally quantized Hall conductance at fractional fillings and an extended quantum anomalous Hall (EQAH) crystal with an integer quantized Hall conductance over an extended region of doping were recently observed in pentalayer graphene. One particularly puzzling observation is the transition between the EQAH and FCI regimes, driven either by temperature or electrical current. Here we propose a scenario to understand these transitions based on the topologically protected gapless edge modes that are present in both the FCI and EQAH phases and should be most relevant at temperature scales below the energy gap. Our consideration is based on the simple assumption that the edge velocity in FCI is smaller than that in EQAHE and thus contributes to a higher entropy. We further argue that domains with opposite fractionally quantized Hall conductance are ubiquitous in the devices due to disorder, which gives rise to a network of edge modes. The velocity of the edge modes between domains is further reduced due to edge reconstruction. The edge velocity can also be reduced by current when the occupation of the edge mode approaches the gap edge. The edge entropy therefore drives the transition from EQAH to FCI either by temperature or current at a nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Photon Antibunching in Single-Molecule Vibrational Sum-Frequency Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum-frequency generation (SFG) allows for coherent upconversion of an electromagnetic signal and has applications in mid-infrared vibrational spectroscopy of molecules. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that plasmonic nanocavities, with their deep sub-wavelength mode volumes, may allow to obtain vibrational SFG signals from a single molecule. In this article, we compute the degree of second order coherence ($g^{(2)}(0)$) of the upconverted mid-infrared field under realistic parameters and accounting for the anharmonic potential that characterizes vibrational modes of individual molecules. On the one hand, we delineate the regime in which the device should operate in order to preserve the second-order coherence of the mid-infrared source, as required in quantum applications. On the other hand, we show that an anharmonic molecular potential can lead to antibunching of the upconverted photons under coherent, Poisson-distributed mid-infrared and visible drives. Our results therefore open a path toward a new kind of bright and tunable source of indistinguishable single photons by leveraging ``vibrational blockade'' in a resonantly and parametrically driven molecule, without the need for strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal oxides play an important role in electronics and optoelectronics, and it is still a challenge to obtain thin oxides film. Here, a fluidic exfoliation method is applied to synthesis the metal oxides film by using galinstan as the reactant, and Ga2O3 film with ~1 cm size is obtained. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope images show that the Ga2O3 film is exfoliated from the galinstan without any droplets left. Energy Dispersive X-Ray measurements confirm the existence of the Ga2O3 film. Transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction patterns indicate the oxidation process do not have a prior direction. The alloy liquid based fluidic exfoliation method in room temperature provide a promising route for the synthesis of two-dimensional mental oxides, which shows significant applications in electronic and photoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>Unusual Phonon Thermal Transport Mechanisms in Monolayer Beryllene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the thermal conductivity of monolayer beryllene using the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation with interatomic force constants obtained from \textit{ab-initio} calculations. Monolayer beryllene exhibits an impressive thermal conductivity of 270 W/m$\cdot$K at room temperature, exceeding that of bulk beryllium by over 100%. Our study reveals a remarkable temperature-dependent behavior: $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ at low temperatures, attributed to higher normal phonon-phonon scatterings, and $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ at high temperatures, due to Umklapp phonon interactions. Mode-specific analysis reveals that flexural phonons with longer lifetimes are the primary contributors to thermal conductivity, accounting for approximately 80%. This dominance results from their lower scattering rates in the out-of-plane direction due to a restricted phase space for scattering processes. Additionally, our findings highlight suppressed Umklapp scattering and reduced phase space for flexural modes, providing a thorough understanding of the eased thermal conductivity in monolayer beryllene and its potential for advanced thermal management applications.</description>

Abstract: Owing to the maturity of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) microelectronics, qubits realized with spins in silicon quantum dots (QDs) are considered among the most promising technologies for building scalable quantum computers. For this goal, ultra-low-power on-chip cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics for control, read-out, and interfacing of the qubits is an important milestone. We report on-chip interfacing of tunable electron and hole QDs by a 64-channel cryo-CMOS multiplexer with less-than-detectable static power dissipation. We analyze charge noise and measure state-of-the-art addition energies and gate lever arm parameters in the QDs. We correlate low noise in QDs and sharp turn-on characteristics in cryogenic transistors, both fabricated with the same gate stack. Finally, we demonstrate that our hybrid quantum-CMOS technology provides a route to scalable interfacing of a large number of QD devices, enabling, for example, variability analysis and QD qubit geometry optimization, which are prerequisites for building large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial fusion of Majorana zero modes in interacting quantum-dot arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental reports of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot systems at the ``sweet spot'', where the electronic hopping $t_h$ is equal to the superconducting coupling $\Delta$, we study the time-dependent spectroscopy corresponding to the non-trivial fusion of MZMs. The expression non-trivial refers to the fusion of Majoranas from different original pairs of MZMs, each with well-defined parities. For the first time, we employ an experimentally accessible time-dependent real-space local density-of-states (LDOS) method to investigate the non-trivial MZMs fusion outcomes in canonical chains and in a Y-shape array of interacting electrons. In the case of quantum-dot chains where two pairs of MZMs are initially disconnected, after fusion we find equal-height peaks in the electron and hole components of the LDOS, signaling non-trivial fusion into both the vacuum $I$ and fermion $\Psi$ channels with equal weight. For $\pi$-junction quantum-dot chains, where the superconducting phase has opposite signs on the left and right portions of the chain, after the non-trivial fusion, we observed the formation of an exotic two-site MZM near the center of the chain, coexisting with another single-site MZM. Furthermore, we also studied the fusion of three MZMs in the Y-shape geometry. In this case, after the fusion we observed the novel formation of another exotic multi-site MZM, with properties depending on the connection and geometry of the central region of the Y-shape quantum-dot array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a direct (Seebeck) and inverse (Peltier) thermoelectric effect induced by electron tunneling between closely separated conducting films. When a transverse temperature gradient is applied along one of two films, a bias voltage is induced in the second thanks to the heat transfer mediated by electrons tunneling through the separation gap. We highlight a non trivial behavior for this Seebeck effect with respect to geometric characteristics of interacting films. Conversely, when an electric current passes through one of two films a strong thermal power can be removed from or inserted in the second film through an induced Peltier effect. In particular we highlight conditions where the induced Seebeck and Peltier coefficients are larger than in the bulk. These induced thermoelectric effects could find broad applications in the fields of energy conversion and cooling at nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals, such as graphene, have undergone extensive exploration, with graphene exhibiting a metallic response limited to the infrared spectral range. Overcoming the challenge of extending the electron mobility in two-dimensional metals to achieve plasmonic behaviors in the visible range necessitates innovative synthesis procedures. In this study, we showcase the successful realization of the phase of \c{hi}_3 borophene on diverse substrates using aluminum-based chemical vapor deposition. Leveraging first-principle density-functional theory alongside advanced deep-subwavelength cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, we reveal the extreme anisotropic response of this material in the visible range, transitioning from hyperbolic polaritonic to an elliptic wavefront. Our calculations substantiate the experimental findings, positioning borophene as an unprecedented candidate for the in-plane hyperbolic response in the visible range. These results open avenues for pioneering optoelectronic applications in the visible spectrum, particularly through the incorporation of borophene into hybrid metallic-semiconducting heterostructures.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from electrons moving in topological spin textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a striking phenomenon, which reflects the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that HHG can be used to reconstruct not only the energy band structure but also the geometric structure characterized by the Berry curvature. Here, we numerically investigate HHG arising from electrons coupled with a topological spin texture in a spin scalar chiral state where time reversal symmetry is broken. In this system, a sign change in scalar chirality alters the sign of the Berry curvature while keeping the energy band structure unchanged, allowing us to discuss purely geometrical effects on HHG. Notably, we found that, when the optical frequency is significantly lower than the energy gap, the sign of scalar chirality largely affects the longitudinal response parallel to the optical field rather than the transverse response. Our analysis suggests that this can be attributed to interband currents induced by the recombination of electron-hole pairs whose real-space trajectories are modulated by the anomalous velocity term.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases of Tight-Binding Trimer Lattice in the BDI Symmetry Class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in which each unit cell consists of three sites. Unlike existing extensions of the SSH model which are made by enlarging the periodicity of the (nearest-neighbor) hopping amplitudes, our modification is obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices in the system's Hamiltonian by their higher dimensional counterparts. This, in turn, leads to the presence of next-nearest neighbor hopping terms and the emergence of different symmetries than those of other extended SSH models. Moreover, the system supports a number of edge states that are protected by a combination of particle-hole, time-reversal, and chiral symmetry. Finally, our system could be potentially realized in various experimental platforms including superconducting circuits as well as acoustic/optical waveguide arrays.</description>

Abstract: There has been much recent interest and progress on topological structures of the non-Hermitian Bloch bands. Here, we study the topological structures of non-Bloch bands of non-Hermitian multiband quantum systems under open boundary conditions, which has received limited attention in prior studies. Using a continuity criterion and an efficient sub-generalized Brillouin zone (sub-GBZ) algorithm, we establish a homotopic characterization -- braiding topology, e.g., characterized by the band's total vorticity -- for open-boundary bands and sub-GBZs. Such topological identification is robust without topological transition and emergent degenerate points, such as exceptional points. We further analyze the transition's impact on bands and spectral flows, including interesting properties unique to open boundaries, and numerically demonstrate our conclusions with tight-binding model examples. We unveil a crucial insight that open-boundary bands interchange their portions after encountering certain exceptional points. Our results enrich the foundational understanding of topological characterizations for generic non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear screening and charge redistribution in periodically doped graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The screening problem for the Coulomb potential of a charge located in a two-dimensional (2D) system has an intriguing solution with a power law distance screening factor due to out-of-plane electrical fields. This is crucially different from a three-dimensional case with exponential screening. The long-range action of electric fields results in the effective inflow of electrons from high-doped regions to low-doped regions of a 2D heterostructure. In graphene and other materials with linear energy spectrum for electrons, such inflow in low-doped regions also occurs, but its effectiveness is dependent on doping level. This can be used for fabricating high-mobility conducting channels. We provide the theory for determining electron potential and concentration in a periodically doped graphene sheet along one dimension taking into account all effects of long-range 2D screening. This results in a substantially nonlinear integro-differential problem, which is solved numerically via computationally cheap algorithm. Similar nonlinear problems arise in a wide range of doped 2D heterostructures made of linear spectrum materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy on charge transport in a junction with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic molecular magnets can be employed to manipulate charge transport in molecular nanojunctions. The charge transport through an electronic level connected to source and drain metallic contacts and exchange-coupled with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant external magnetic field is studied here. Both the magnetic field and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin control the total precession frequency. The Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions method is used to derive expressions for charge current and current noise. The precessing molecular magnetization drives inelastic tunnelling processes between electronic quasienergy levels. The dc-bias voltages allow to unveil the quasienergy levels, Larmor frequency and the anisotropy parameter, through characteristics of charge-transport measurements involving features such as steps, peaks and dips. Under zero-bias voltage conditions, for a sufficiently large anisotropy parameter that enables the decrease of the total precession frequency or change of the precession direction with respect to Larmor precession, the shot noise is reduced. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the magnetic anisotropy parameter to suppress the precession frequency, leading to the suppression of shot noise. The results show that in the given setup, the charge current and shot noise can be controlled by the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the molecular magnet.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Skin Effect through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian Correspondence and Its Observation in an Acoustic Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive topological phenomenon observed in nonHermitian systems. Recently, there has been considerable interest in exploring higher-order NHSE occurrences in two and three dimensions. In such systems, topological edge states collapse into a corner while bulk states remain delocalized. Through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian correspondence, this study predicts and experimentally observes the higher-order NHSE in an acoustic Kagome lattice possessing nonreciprocal hoppings. By rotating the frequency spectrum and employing complexfrequency excitation techniques, we observe the localization of acoustic energy towards a corner of the lattice in the topologically nontrivial phase, even when the source is located far from that corner. In contrast, the acoustic energy spreads out when excited at the frequencies hosting the bulk states. These observations are unequivocal evidence of the higher-order NHSE.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Winding Tuple for Non-Hermitian Topological Edge Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between topological localization and non-Hermiticity localization in non-Hermitian crystal systems results in a diversity of shapes of topological edge modes (EMs), offering opportunities to manipulate these modes for potential topological applications. The conventional strategy for characterizing the domain of EMs is to calculate the topological invariants, but which does not provide the wavefunction forms of EMs. This leads to the the bulk-boundary correspondence typically being verified only through numerical methods. In this work, by recognizing EMs as specified solutions of eigenequation, we derive their wavefunctions in an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We then inversely construct a winding tuple $\left \{ w_{\scriptscriptstyle GBZ},w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}\right \} $ that characterizes the existence of EMs and their spatial distribution. Moreover, we define a new spectral winding number equivalent to $w_{\scriptscriptstyle BZ}$, which is determined by the product of energies of different bands. The inverse design of topological invariants allows us to categorize the localized nature of EMs even in systems lacking sublattice symmetry, which can facilitate the manipulation and utilization of EMs in the development of novel quantum materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Planar scanning probe microscopy enables vector magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar scanning probe microscopy is a recently emerging alternative approach to tip-based scanning probe imaging. It can scan an extended planar sensor, such as a polished bulk diamond doped with magnetic-field-sensitive nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, in nanometer-scale proximity of a planar sample. So far, this technique has been limited to optical near-field microscopy, and has required nanofabrication of the sample of interest. Here we extend this technique to magnetometry using NV centers, and present a modification that removes the need for sample-side nanofabrication. We harness this new ability to perform a hitherto infeasible measurement - direct imaging of the three-dimensional vector magnetic field of magnetic vortices in a thin film magnetic heterostructure, based on repeated scanning with NV centers with different orientations within the same scanning probe. Our result opens the door to quantum sensing using multiple qubits within the same scanning probe, a prerequisite for the use of entanglement-enhanced and massively parallel schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to the accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary in open boundary lattice models, which can be systematically characterized using the non-Bloch band theory. Here, we apply the non-Bloch band theory to investigate the stochastic reaction-diffusion process by mapping it to a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain. We exactly obtain the open boundary spectrum and the generalized Brillouin zone, and identify a robust zero mode arising from the non-Bloch topology. Notably, distinct from its Hermitian counterpart in the quantum context, the zero mode supports anomalous dynamical crossover in the Markov process. We quantitatively demonstrate the intriguing dynamical effects through the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian on the non-Bloch eigenstates, and confirm our findings by conducting stochastic simulations with high accuracy. Our study highlights the significant and general role of non-Bloch topology in non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by superconductors with a finite phase difference under non-Hermiticity, which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs. Depending on the structure of non-Hermiticity, captured in terms of retarded self-energies, the low-energy spectrum hosts topologically stable exceptional points either at zero or finite real energies as a function of the superconducting phase difference. Interestingly, the corresponding phase-biased supercurrents may acquire divergent profiles at such exceptional points. This instance is a natural and unique non-Hermitian effect that signals a possible way to enhance the sensitivity of Josephson junctions. Our work opens a way for realizing unique non-Hermitian phenomena due to the interplay between non-Hermitian topology and the Josephson effect.</description>

      <title>Telling different unravelings apart via nonlinear quantum-trajectory averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation (ME) governs the density matrix of open quantum systems (OQSs). When an OQS is subjected to weak continuous measurement, its state evolves as a stochastic quantum trajectory, whose statistical average solves the ME. The ensemble of such trajectories is termed an unraveling of the ME. We propose a method to operationally distinguish unravelings produced by the same ME in different measurement scenarios, using nonlinear averages of observables over trajectories. We apply the method to the paradigmatic quantum nonlinear system of resonance fluorescence in a two-level atom. We compare the Poisson-type unraveling, induced by direct detection of photons scattered from the two-level emitter, and the Wiener-type unraveling, induced by phase-sensitive detection of the emitted field. We show that a quantum-trajectory-averaged variance is able to distinguish these measurement scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the method, which can be readily extended to more complex OQSs, under a range of realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <title>Implementing a synthetic magnetic vector potential in a 2D superconducting qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically \ensuremath{\text{Cu}_{3}-\text{X}}(\ensuremath{\text{X=As, Sb}}), characterized by a slightly distorted equilateral triangle configuration. Using the Heisenberg model with exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, g-factors, and an external magnetic field, we investigate three quantum machines using this system as the working substance, assuming reversible processes. The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is significant at low temperatures (around 1K) under a perpendicular magnetic field (\sim5T). We analyze how MCE influences the Carnot machine, which operates as a heat engine or refrigerator when varying the external magnetic field. In contrast, the Otto and Stirling machines can operate as heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, or thermal accelerators, depending on the magnetic field intensity. Our results indicate that enhanced MCE broadens the operating regions for these machines, with the Otto and Stirling machines primarily functioning as refrigerators and accelerators. The corresponding thermal efficiencies are also discussed for all operating modes.</description>

      <title>Extended quantum anomalous Hall effect in moir\'e structures: phase transitions and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on multilayer rhombohedral graphene have unearthed a number of interesting phenomena in the regime where Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall phenomena were previously reported. Specifically at low temperature ($T$) and low applied currents, an "Extended" Integer Quantum Anomalous Hall (EIQAH) is seen over a wide range of the phase diagram. As the current is increased, at low $T$, the EIQAH undergoes a phase transition to a metallic state at generic fillings, and to the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) state at the Jain fillings. Increasing temperature at the Jain fillings also leads to an evolution out of the EIQAH to the Jain state. Here we provide an interpretation of many of these observations. We describe the EIQAH as a crystalline state (either of holes doped into the $\nu = 1$ state, or an Anomalous Hall Crystal of electrons) that breaks moir\'e translation symmetry. At generic fillings, we show how an electric current-induced depinning transition of the crystalline order leads to peculiar non-linear current-voltage curves consistent with the experiment. At Jain fillings, we propose that the depinning transition is pre-empted by an equilibrium transition between EIQAH and Jain FQAH states. This transition occurs due to the large polarizability of the Jain FQAH states which enables them to lower their energy effectively in an applied electric field compared to the crystal states. We also discuss the finite temperature evolution in terms of the relative entropies of the crystalline and FQAH states.</description>

Abstract: With significant advances in classifying and cataloguing topological matter, the focus of topological physics has shifted towards quantum control, particularly the creation and manipulation of topological phases of matter. Floquet engineering, the concept of tailoring a system by periodic fields, offers a powerful tool to manipulate electronic properties of condensed systems, and even to create exotic non-equilibrium topological states that are impossibly present in equilibrium scenarios. In this perspective, we give a brief review of recent progress in theoretical investigations of Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials. We show that light irradiation can realize various desired topological states through the introduction of symmetry breaking, such as first- and higher-order Weyl fermions, quadrupole topological insulator with periodic driving and disorder, quantum anomalous Hall effects with a tunable Chern number, as well as beyond. Moreover, based on first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we show several realistic material candidates proposed as potential hosts for promising Floquet topological states, facilitating their verification in experiments. We believe that our perspective on Floquet engineering of topological states will advance further studies of rich exotic light-induced phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>

Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>
