      <title>How to Make an Action Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two actions in a decision problem, a and b, each of which that produces a state-dependent monetary reward, we study how to robustly make action a more attractive. Action a' improves upon a in this manner if the set of beliefs at which a is preferred to b is a subset of the set of beliefs at which a' is preferred to b, irrespective of the risk-averse agent's utility function (in money). We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications in bilateral trade and insurance.</description>

      <title>Undominated monopoly regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study undominated mechanisms with transfers for regulating a monopolist who privately observes the marginal cost of production. We show that in any undominated mechanism, there is a quantity floor, which depends only on the primitives, and the regulator's operation decision is stochastic only if the monopolist produces at the quantity floor. We provide a near-complete characterization of the set of undominated mechanisms and use it to (a) provide a foundation for deterministic mechanisms, (b) show that the efficient mechanism is dominated, and (c) derive a max-min optimal regulatory mechanism.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. We aim to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs for screening agents' values. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on this implication, we propose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Periodic Trading Activities in Financial Markets: Mean-field Liquidation Game with Major-Minor Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent empirical findings on the periodic phenomenon of aggregated market volumes in equity markets, we aim to understand the causes and consequences of periodic trading activities through a game-theoretic perspective, examining market interactions among different types of participants. Specifically, we introduce a new mean-field liquidation game involving major and minor traders, where the major trader evaluates her strategy against a periodic targeting strategy while a continuum of minor players trade against her. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an open-loop Nash equilibrium. In addition, we prove an O(1/sqrt N) approximation rate of the mean-field solution to the Nash equilibrium in a major-minor game with N minor players. In equilibrium, minor traders exhibit front-running behaviors in both the periodic and trend components of their strategies, reducing the major trader's profit. Such strategic interactions diminish the strength of periodicity in both overall trading volume and asset prices. Our model rationalizes observed periodic trading activities in the market and offers new insights into market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Mechanisms for Resource Allocation Without Monetary Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem in which a central planner sequentially allocates a single resource to multiple strategic agents using their utility reports at each round, but without using any monetary transfers. We consider general agent utility distributions and two standard settings: a finite horizon $T$ and an infinite horizon with $\gamma$ discounts. We provide general tools to characterize the convergence rate between the optimal mechanism for the central planner and the first-best allocation if true agent utilities were available. This heavily depends on the utility distributions, yielding rates anywhere between $1/\sqrt T$ and $1/T$ for the finite-horizon setting, and rates faster than $\sqrt{1-\gamma}$, including exponential rates for the infinite-horizon setting as agents are more patient $\gamma\to 1$. On the algorithmic side, we design mechanisms based on the promised-utility framework to achieve these rates and leverage structure on the utility distributions. Intuitively, the more flexibility the central planner has to reward or penalize any agent while incurring little social welfare cost, the faster the convergence rate. In particular, discrete utility distributions typically yield the slower rates $1/\sqrt T$ and $\sqrt{1-\gamma}$, while smooth distributions with density typically yield faster rates $1/T$ (up to logarithmic factors) and $1-\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Incentive Contracts and Peer Effects in the Workplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of a principal designing wage contracts that simultaneously incentivize and insure workers. Workers' incentives are connected through chains of productivity spillovers, represented by a network of peer-effects. We solve for the optimal linear contract for any network and show that optimal incentives are steeper for more central workers. We link firm profits to organizations' structure via the spectral properties of the coworker network. When production is modular, the incentive allocation rule is sensitive to the link structure across and within modules. When firms can't write personalize contracts, better connected workers extract rents. In this case, unemployment emerges endogenously because large within-group differences in centrality can decrease firm's profits.</description>

      <title>Harmful choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the choice behavior of a decision maker (DM) who harms herself, by maximizing some distortion of her true preference, in which the first $i$ alternatives are moved to the bottom, in a reversed order. The deterministic declination of our pattern has no empirical power, but it allows to define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial of pleasure adopted by the DM in her decision. We analyze irrational choices that display the lowest degree of self-punishment, and a characterization of them is provided. Moreover, we characterize the choice behavior that exhibits the highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that it comprises almost all choices. We also characterize stochastic self-punishment, which collects all the Random Utility Models (RUMs) whose support is restricted to the harmful distortions of some preference. Full identification of the DM's preference and randomization over its harmful distortions is allowed if each alternative is selected from the ground set with probability greater than zero. Finally, the degree of self-punishment of harmful stochastic choices is characterized.</description>
