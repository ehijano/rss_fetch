      <title>Monitoring Single DNA Docking Site Activity With Sequential Modes of an Optoplasmonic Whispering-Gallery Mode Biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid advancement in single-molecule techniques, driven by their unparalleled precision in studying molecules whose sizes are beyond the diffraction limit. Among these techniques, optoplasmonic whispering gallery mode sensing has demonstrated great potential in label-free single-molecule characterization. It combines the principles of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensing, offering exceptional sensing capabilities, even at the level of single ions. However, current optoplasmonic WGM sensing operates in a multiplexed channel, making it challenging to focus on individual binding sites of analyte molecules. In this article, we characterize different binding sites of DNA analyte molecules hybridizing to docking strands on the optoplasmonic WGM sensor, using the ratio of the resonance shift between sequential polar WGM modes. We identify specific docking sites that undergo transient interactions and eventually hybridize with the complementary analyte strands permanently.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the crossed interhemispheric transfer of the left-right mirror-images in human vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is common in animal and human brains where the lack of asymmetry often perturbs behavioral and cognitive functions. In particular, the ubiquity of mirror-image confusion in young children, which often persists in dyslexia, is established. However, the very existence of these symmetric mirror-images and their perceptual or memory nature remain controversial. Here, using the noise-activated afterimage method, we demonstrate that a dyslexic with mirror-images is an ideal candidate for solving the mystery. Indeed, after a monocular fixation, the primary afterimages are perceived alone through this eye, while the mirror-images are also perceived alone, but exclusively through the other eye which has remained closed. We deduce that the callosal interhemispheric connections are necessarily projected on the dominance columns of layer 4 of the primary cortex, the only layer where segregation is strict, and are furthermore crossed. Our results show that perceived primary and mirror images are spatially and temporally resolved.</description>

      <title>Formation and Regulation of Calcium Sparks on a Nonlinear Spatial Network of Ryanodine Receptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate regulation of calcium release is essential for cellular signaling, with the spatial distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) playing a critical role. In this study, we present a nonlinear spatial network model that simulates RyR spatial organization to investigate calcium release dynamics by integrating RyR behavior, calcium buffering, and calsequestrin (CSQ) regulation. The model successfully reproduces calcium sparks, shedding light on their initiation, duration, and termination mechanisms under clamped calcium conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that RyR clusters act as on-off switches for calcium release, producing short-lived calcium quarks and longer-lasting calcium sparks based on distinct activation patterns. Spark termination is governed by calcium gradients and stochastic RyR dynamics, with CSQ facilitating RyR closure and spark termination. We also uncover the dual role of CSQ as both a calcium buffer and a regulator of RyRs. Elevated CSQ levels prolong calcium release due to buffering effects, while CSQ-RyR interactions induce excessive refractoriness, a phenomenon linked to pathological conditions such as ventricular arrhythmias. Dysregulated CSQ function disrupts the on-off switching behavior of RyRs, impairing calcium release dynamics. These findings provide new insights into RyR-mediated calcium signaling, highlighting CSQ's pivotal role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and its implications for pathological conditions. This work advances the understanding of calcium spark regulation and underscores its significance for cardiomyocyte function.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective radical reactions can be induced by electron spin polarization: A quantum mechanism for Nature's emergent homochirality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules that constitute life on Earth are chiral, but the precise mechanism by which homochirality emerged remains a mystery. In this work it is demonstrated that reactions of radical pairs, where one of the radical electron spins is polarised, can be enantioselective. This phenomenon arises from transient coherent quantum dynamics of the radical pair electron spins, which is known to occur even in warm and noisy condensed phase environments, where energetic perturbations much smaller than thermal energy can have large effects on reactivity. A quantitative theory is presented based on the molecular theory of chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), where electron exchange interactions and chirality-dependent spin-orbit coupling effects control enantioselectivity. This theory provides useful bounds on the maximum enantiomeric excess for these reactions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments. The enantioseletive radical pair mechanism presented here provides an alternative mechanistic basis to a recent proposal that spin-polarised photoelectrons from magnetite provided the initial chiral symmetry breaking necessary for the inception of homochirality in Nature, as well as suggests a new strategy for asymmetric synthesis using spin-polarised electrons.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in coupled viscoelastic media: A fractional Langevin equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\alpha&lt;\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\alpha=\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dispersion of active microswimmers in confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of a laminar shear flow, the diffusion of passive colloidal particles is enhanced in the direction parallel to the flow. This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows - a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, e.g. regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and wavelet decomposition. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor-Aris law to active particles is valid.</description>

      <title>Rapid MRI-Based Synthetic CT Simulations for Precise tFUS Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate targeting is critical for the effectiveness of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) neuromodulation. While CT provides accurate skull acoustic properties, its ionizing radiation and poor soft tissue contrast limit clinical applicability. In contrast, MRI offers superior neuroanatomical visualization without radiation exposure but lacks skull property mapping. This study proposes a novel, fully CT free simulation framework that integrates MRI-derived synthetic CT (sCT) with efficient modeling techniques for rapid and precise tFUS targeting. We trained a deep-learning model to generate sCT from T1-weighted MRI and integrated it with both full-wave (k-Wave) and accelerated simulation methods, hybrid angular spectrum (kWASM) and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld ASM (RSASM). Across five skull models, both full-wave and hybrid pipelines using sCT demonstrated sub-millimeter targeting deviation, focal shape consistency (FWHM ~3.3-3.8 mm), and &lt;0.2 normalized pressure error compared to CT-based gold standard. Notably, the kW-ASM and RS-ASM pipelines reduced simulation time from ~3320 s to 187 s and 34 s respectively, achieving ~94% and ~90% time savings. These results confirm that MRI-derived sCT combined with innovative rapid simulation techniques enables fast, accurate, and radiation-free tFUS planning, supporting its feasibility for scalable clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Trapping of Tracer Particles Induced by Spatially Correlated Noise in Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating Stokes equation in the presence of spatially correlated noise -- characterized by a single length scale -- while preserving thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends nonmonotonically on the ratio $\ell/r$ between the correlation length $\ell$ and the particle radius $r$: the MSD decreases as $\ell$ approaches $r$, reaches a minimum near $\ell\simeq r$, and rises again for $\ell &gt; r$. The initial suppression stems from transient trapping, where sluggish momentum diffusion at short wavelengths confines the particle. When $\ell&gt;r$, the particle hops between traps and eventually recovers normal diffusion ($\text{MSD}\propto t$) consistent with the fact that momentum diffusion crosses over to the standard Laplacian at long wavelengths. We further illustrate that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equations, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviors using transition-based allosteric self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allosteric interactions occur when binding at one part of a complex affects the interactions at another part. Allostery offers a high degree of control in multi-species processes, and these interactions play a crucial role in many biological and synthetic contexts. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure, or replicate. In this work we establish a basic allosteric model and develop an intuitive design process, which we demonstrate by constructing systems to exhibit four different complex behaviors: controlled fiber growth, shape-shifting, sorting, and self-replication. In order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed, we also calculate and measure key length and time scales. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviors, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.</description>

      <title>Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. Exploring parameter space beyond the isoform parameters typical for animal cells, we also find cell oscillations in length and velocity, which might be realized for genetically engineered systems. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit, which then is used to calculate a state diagram, and the effect of actin polymerization at the boundaries, that leads to an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.</description>
