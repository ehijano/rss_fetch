      <title>HiAER-Spike: Hardware-Software Co-Design for Large-Scale Reconfigurable Event-Driven Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present HiAER-Spike, a modular, reconfigurable, event-driven neuromorphic computing platform designed to execute large spiking neural networks with up to 160 million neurons and 40 billion synapses - roughly twice the neurons of a mouse brain at faster-than real-time. This system, which is currently under construction at the UC San Diego Supercomputing Center, comprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time massively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of spikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. Our architecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity for robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud computing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to hardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration and execution of general spiking neural networks with virtually no constraints in topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by the wider community. In the following we provide an overview of the hard- and software stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of the system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic community.</description>

      <title>Attention-Driven LPLC2 Neural Ensemble Model for Multi-Target Looming Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lobula plate/lobula columnar, type 2 (LPLC2) visual projection neurons in the fly's visual system possess highly looming-selective properties, making them ideal for developing artificial collision detection systems. The four dendritic branches of individual LPLC2 neurons, each tuned to specific directional motion, enhance the robustness of looming detection by utilizing radial motion opponency. Existing models of LPLC2 neurons either concentrate on individual cells to detect centroid-focused expansion or utilize population-voting strategies to obtain global collision information. However, their potential for addressing multi-target collision scenarios remains largely untapped. In this study, we propose a numerical model for LPLC2 populations, leveraging a bottom-up attention mechanism driven by motion-sensitive neural pathways to generate attention fields (AFs). This integration of AFs with highly nonlinear LPLC2 responses enables precise and continuous detection of multiple looming objects emanating from any region of the visual field. We began by conducting comparative experiments to evaluate the proposed model against two related models, highlighting its unique characteristics. Next, we tested its ability to detect multiple targets in dynamic natural scenarios. Finally, we validated the model using real-world video data collected by aerial robots. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model excels in detecting, distinguishing, and tracking multiple looming targets with remarkable speed and accuracy. This advanced ability to detect and localize looming objects, especially in complex and dynamic environments, holds great promise for overcoming collision-detection challenges in mobile intelligent machines.</description>

      <title>Memetic Search for Green Vehicle Routing Problem with Private Capacitated Refueling Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The green vehicle routing problem with private capacitated alternative fuel stations (GVRP-PCAFS) extends the traditional green vehicle routing problem by considering refueling stations limited capacity, where a limited number of vehicles can refuel simultaneously with additional vehicles must wait. This feature presents new challenges for route planning, as waiting times at stations must be managed while keeping route durations within limits and reducing total travel distance. This article presents METS, a novel memetic algorithm (MA) with separate constraint-based tour segmentation (SCTS) and efficient local search (ELS) for solving GVRP-PCAFS. METS combines global and local search effectively through three novelties. For global search, the SCTS strategy splits giant tours to generate diverse solutions, and the search process is guided by a comprehensive fitness evaluation function to dynamically control feasibility and diversity to produce solutions that are both diverse and near-feasible. For local search, ELS incorporates tailored move operators with constant-time move evaluation mechanisms, enabling efficient exploration of large solution neighborhoods. Experimental results demonstrate that METS discovers 31 new best-known solutions out of 40 instances in existing benchmark sets, achieving substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a new large-scale benchmark set based on real-world logistics data is introduced to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Neural Field Modeling of Visual Contrast for Perceiving Incoherent Looming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amari's Dynamic Neural Field (DNF) framework provides a brain-inspired approach to modeling the average activation of neuronal groups. Leveraging a single field, DNF has become a promising foundation for low-energy looming perception module in robotic applications. However, the previous DNF methods face significant challenges in detecting incoherent or inconsistent looming features--conditions commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, such as collision detection in rainy weather. Insights from the visual systems of fruit flies and locusts reveal encoding ON/OFF visual contrast plays a critical role in enhancing looming selectivity. Additionally, lateral excitation mechanism potentially refines the responses of loom-sensitive neurons to both coherent and incoherent stimuli. Together, these offer valuable guidance for improving looming perception models. Building on these biological evidence, we extend the previous single-field DNF framework by incorporating the modeling of ON/OFF visual contrast, each governed by a dedicated DNF. Lateral excitation within each ON/OFF-contrast field is formulated using a normalized Gaussian kernel, and their outputs are integrated in the Summation field to generate collision alerts. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed model effectively addresses incoherent looming detection challenges and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art locust-inspired models. It demonstrates robust performance across diverse stimuli, including synthetic rain effects, underscoring its potential for reliable looming perception in complex, noisy environments with inconsistent visual cues.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Method for Hydropower Plant Condition-based Maintenance combining Autoencoder with Clustering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The French company EDF uses supervisory control and data acquisition systems in conjunction with a data management platform to monitor hydropower plant, allowing engineers and technicians to analyse the time-series collected. Depending on the strategic importance of the monitored hydropower plant, the number of time-series collected can vary greatly making it difficult to generate valuable information from the extracted data. In an attempt to provide an answer to this particular problem, a condition detection and diagnosis method combining clustering algorithms and autoencoder neural networks for pattern recognition has been developed and is presented in this paper. First, a dimension reduction algorithm is used to create a 2-or 3-dimensional projection that allows the users to identify unsuspected relationships between datapoints. Then, a collection of clustering algorithms regroups the datapoints into clusters. For each identified cluster, an autoencoder neural network is trained on the corresponding dataset. The aim is to measure the reconstruction error between each autoencoder model and the measured values, thus creating a proximity index for each state discovered during the clustering stage.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity in Unstructured and Unbounded Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms are powerful tools for discovering diverse, high-performing solutions. Recently, Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity (MOQD) extends QD to problems with several objectives while preserving solution diversity. MOQD has shown promise in fields such as robotics and materials science, where finding trade-offs between competing objectives like energy efficiency and speed, or material properties is essential. However, existing methods in MOQD rely on tessellating the feature space into a grid structure, which prevents their application in domains where feature spaces are unknown or must be learned, such as complex biological systems or latent exploration tasks. In this work, we introduce Multi-Objective Unstructured Repertoire for Quality-Diversity (MOUR-QD), a MOQD algorithm designed for unstructured and unbounded feature spaces. We evaluate MOUR-QD on five robotic tasks. Importantly, we show that our method excels in tasks where features must be learned, paving the way for applying MOQD to unsupervised domains. We also demonstrate that MOUR-QD is advantageous in domains with unbounded feature spaces, outperforming existing grid-based methods. Finally, we demonstrate that MOUR-QD is competitive with established MOQD methods on existing MOQD tasks and achieves double the MOQD-score in some environments. MOUR-QD opens up new opportunities for MOQD in domains like protein design and image generation.</description>

      <title>Decision SpikeFormer: Spike-Driven Transformer for Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy training solely on pre-collected data, avoiding direct environment interaction - a crucial benefit for energy-constrained embodied AI applications. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance.

      <title>Efficient FPGA-accelerated Convolutional Neural Networks for Cloud Detection on CubeSats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of four FPGA-accelerated convolutional neural network (CNN) models for onboard cloud detection in resource-constrained CubeSat missions, leveraging Xilinx's Vitis AI (VAI) framework and Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU), a programmable engine with pre-implemented, parameterizable IP cores optimized for deep neural networks, on a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. This study explores both pixel-wise (Pixel-Net and Patch-Net) and image-wise (U-Net and Scene-Net) models to benchmark trade-offs in accuracy, latency, and model complexity. Applying channel pruning, we achieved substantial reductions in model parameters (up to 98.6%) and floating-point operations (up to 90.7%) with minimal accuracy loss. Furthermore, the VAI tool was used to quantize the models to 8-bit precision, ensuring optimized hardware performance with negligible impact on accuracy. All models retained high accuracy post-FPGA integration, with a cumulative maximum accuracy drop of only 0.6% after quantization and pruning. The image-wise Scene-Net and U-Net models demonstrated strong real-time inference capabilities, achieving frame rates per second of 57.14 and 37.45, respectively, with power consumption of around 2.5 W, surpassing state-of-the-art onboard cloud detection solutions. Our approach underscores the potential of DPU-based hardware accelerators to expand the processing capabilities of small satellites, enabling efficient and flexible onboard CNN-based applications.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</description>

Abstract: Approximation capability of reservoir systems whose reservoir is a recurrent neural network (RNN) is discussed. We show what we call uniform strong universality of RNN reservoir systems for a certain class of dynamical systems. This means that, given an approximation error to be achieved, one can construct an RNN reservoir system that approximates each target dynamical system in the class just via adjusting its linear readout. To show the universality, we construct an RNN reservoir system via parallel concatenation that has an upper bound of approximation error independent of each target in the class.</description>

      <title>REvolve: Reward Evolution with Large Language Models using Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) allows computer models to learn, visualize, optimize, refine, and predict data. To understand its present state, examining the most recent advancements and applications of deep learning across various domains is essential. However, prior reviews focused on DL applications in only one or two domains. The current review thoroughly investigates the use of DL in four different broad fields due to the plenty of relevant research literature in these domains. This wide range of coverage provides a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of DL's influence and opportunities, which is lacking in other reviews. The study also discusses DL frameworks and addresses the benefits and challenges of utilizing DL in each field, which is only occasionally available in other reviews. DL frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch make it easy to develop innovative DL applications across diverse domains by providing model development and deployment platforms. This helps bridge theoretical progress and practical implementation. Deep learning solves complex problems and advances technology in many fields, demonstrating its revolutionary potential and adaptability. CNN LSTM models with attention mechanisms can forecast traffic with 99 percent accuracy. Fungal diseased mango leaves can be classified with 97.13 percent accuracy by the multi layer CNN model. However, deep learning requires rigorous data collection to analyze and process large amounts of data because it is independent of training data. Thus, large scale medical, research, healthcare, and environmental data compilation are challenging, reducing deep learning effectiveness. Future research should address data volume, privacy, domain complexity, and data quality issues in DL datasets.</description>

Abstract: This note addresses the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART) and the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), focusing on their common and frequent misinterpretations in many papers related to neural network approximation. Our remarks aim to support a more accurate understanding of KART and UAT among neural network specialists. In addition, we explore the minimal number of neurons required for universal approximation, showing that KART's lower bounds extend to standard multilayer perceptrons, even with smooth activation functions.</description>
