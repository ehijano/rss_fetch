      <title>Fiscal Policy and Household Savings in Central Europe (Poland, Croatia, and Slovak Republic) -- A Markov Switching VAR with Covid Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of fiscal policies on household consumption, disposable income, and the propensity to consume during the COVID-19 pandemic across Croatia, Slovakia, and Poland. The purpose is to assess how variations in government debt, expenditures, revenue, and subsidies influenced household financial behaviors in response to economic shocks. Using a Markov Switching VAR model across three regimes: initial impact, peak crisis, and recovery.This analysis captures changes in household consumption, disposable income, and consumption propensities under different fiscal policy measures.
  The findings reveal that the Slovak Republic exhibited the highest fiscal effectiveness, demonstrating effective government policies that stimulated consumer spending and supported household income during the pandemic. Croatia also showed positive outcomes, particularly in terms of income, although rising government debt posed challenges to overall effectiveness. Conversely, Poland faced significant obstacles, with its fiscal measures leading to lower consumption and income outcomes, indicating limited policy efficacy.
  Conclusions emphasize the importance of tailored fiscal measures, as their effectiveness varied across countries and economic contexts. Recommendations include reinforcing consumption-supportive policies, particularly during crisis periods, to stabilize income and consumption expectations. This study underscores the significance of targeted fiscal actions in promoting household resilience and economic stability, as exemplified by the successful approach taken by the Slovak Republic.</description>

      <title>Community Bank Establishment and Consumption Growth: Evidence from Panel Study of Income Dynamics in USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumption is a primary source of economic growth and key indicator of poverty. The establishment of community banks can provide credit resources, unlocking household consumption potential and playing a crucial role in economic development. This study explores the role of community banks in promoting consumption by using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for 11 waves from 1980 to 1990, and constructing a fixed-effects model using the time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) method. The findings indicate that the establishment of community banks effectively stimulates growth in local household consumption, primarily by increasing household income and reducing precautionary savings. Therefore, both government and financial institutions should further promote the development of regional financial institutions and credit tools to promote economic growth.</description>

      <title>SOE's ESG Performance on Financial Flexibility: The Evidence from the Hong Kong Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global economic environment becomes increasingly unstable, enhancing financial flexibility to cope with risks has become the consensus of many companies. At the same time, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance may be one of the effective ways. We studied the impact of a firm's ESG performance on its financial flexibility with a sample of companies listed on the Hong Kong stock market from 2018 to 2022. The empirical results show that good environmental, social and governance performance can significantly improve a firm's financial flexibility. In addition, this paper also finds that the influence of ESG performance on financial flexibility is weak for state-owned enterprises due to the influence of governance structure and market characteristics. Finally, the further analysis shows that there is a mediating role played by financing constraints in this process. This study can provide background information for state-owned enterprises' governance, information disclosure, and corporate operations. It also has guiding significance for relevant investors, management and officials.</description>

      <title>Secondary materials, Pigouvian taxes, and a monopsony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary materials present promising opportunities for firms to repurpose emissions into marketable goods, aligning with circular economy principles. This paper examines conditions under which introducing a market for secondary materials can completely replace Pigouvian emissions taxes. These conditions prove highly restrictive: positive Pigouvian emissions taxes remain necessary unless secondary materials prices immediately reach unrealistically high levels. We propose that the socially optimal budget-neutral policy is to subsidize secondary materials prices while taxing uncontrolled emissions. Further, we extend the analysis to a two-firm framework where a data center supplies residual heat to a district heating firm acting as a monopsony buyer. This extension explicitly models the demand for residual heat and explores how subsidies and emissions taxes align firm incentives with the social optimum in the absence of competitive markets.</description>

      <title>Stories that (are) Move(d by) Markets: A Causal Exploration of Market Shocks and Semantic Shifts across Different Partisan Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroeconomic fluctuations and the narratives that shape them form a mutually reinforcing cycle: public discourse can spur behavioural changes leading to economic shifts, which then result in changes in the stories that propagate. We show that shifts in semantic embedding space can be causally linked to financial market shocks -- deviations from the expected market behaviour. Furthermore, we show how partisanship can influence the predictive power of text for market fluctuations and shape reactions to those same shocks. We also provide some evidence that text-based signals are particularly salient during unexpected events such as COVID-19, highlighting the value of language data as an exogenous variable in economic forecasting. Our findings underscore the bidirectional relationship between news outlets and market shocks, offering a novel empirical approach to studying their effect on each other.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Methods for Solving Discrete-time Dynamic models with Continuous Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates computationally efficient algorithms for solving discrete-time infinite-horizon single-agent/multi-agent dynamic models with continuous actions. It shows that we can easily reduce the computational costs by slightly changing basic algorithms using value functions, such as the Value Function Iteration (VFI) and the Policy Iteration (PI).
  The PI method with a Krylov iterative method (GMRES), which can be easily implemented using built-in packages, works much better than VFI-based algorithms even when considering continuous state models. Concerning the VFI algorithm, we can largely speed up the convergence by introducing acceleration methods of fixed-point iterations. The current study also proposes the VF-PGI-Spectral (Value Function-Policy Gradient Iteration Spectral) algorithm, which is a slight modification of the VFI. It shows numerical results where the VF-PGI-Spectral performs much better than the VFI- and PI-based algorithms especially in multi-agent dynamic games. Finally, it shows that using relative value functions further reduces the computational cost of these methods.</description>

      <title>Using Covid-19 Response Policy to Estimate Open Water Swim Drafting Effects in Triathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal effects of open-water swim drafting by leveraging a natural experiment induced by staggered race starts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before 2020, athletes started in groups, enabling drafting benefits, while pandemic-related restrictions significantly reduced these opportunities. Using agglomerative hierarchical clustering of swim-out times, I analyze optimal drafting positions and estimate their impact on Swim-Out performance. Our empirical findings reveal that swim drafting benefits were statistically insignificant in 2020 but persisted post-pandemic at slightly reduced levels. I find that drafting becomes advantageous only from the third trailing position onward, with earlier positions primarily serving to minimize fatigue. To mitigate endogeneity, I employ athlete and event fixed effects. The seemingly inverse decaying nature of drafting benefits partially addresses some concerns of simultaneous reverse causality and omitted variable bias. This study provides the first largescale causal estimate of drafting effects in real-world triathlon race settings.</description>

      <title>Potato Potahto in the FAO-GAEZ Productivity Measures? Nonclassical Measurement Error with Multiple Proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FAO-GAEZ crop productivity data are widely used in Economics. However, the existence of measurement error is rarely recognized in the empirical literature. We propose a novel method to partially identify the effect of agricultural productivity, deriving bounds that allow for nonclassical measurement error by leveraging two proxies. These bounds exhaust all the information contained in the first two moments of the data. We reevaluate three influential studies, documenting that measurement error matters and that the impact of agricultural productivity on economic outcomes may be smaller than previously reported. Our methodology has broad applications in empirical research involving mismeasured variables.</description>
