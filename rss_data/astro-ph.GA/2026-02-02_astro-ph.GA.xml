      <title>Little Red Dots on FIRE: The Ability of Bursty Galaxies to Host an Abundant Population of High-Redshift AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled an abundant population of potential active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift ($z\gtrsim4$) known as little red dots (LRDs), which are likely hosted in relatively low-mass galaxies. However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($&lt;100 \rm \ pc$) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 2\times10^5 \ \rm M_\odot$ black holes residing in $M_\star \gtrsim 2\times10^7 \ \rm M_\odot$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Little Blue and Red Dots Rosetta Stones: Non-Gaussian broad lines, hot dust, and X-ray weakness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibits peculiar properties that distinguish it from both local type I AGN and high-redshift quasars. Most of these sources are compact, appearing as 'little dots': among them, the sub-class (10-30% of the total) characterized by significantly red optical colors has been named 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs), while here we analogously introduce the term 'Little Blue Dots' (LBDs) for the remaining, bluer sources (70-90%). We then present a comparative analysis of the prototypical representatives ('Rosetta Stones') of the two classes: GN-28074 at z=2.26, the Red Rosetta Stone, and GS-3073 at z=5.55, the Blue Rosetta Stone. In both Rosetta Stones the broad Balmer lines are better described by exponential profiles rather than single Gaussians, similarly to normal low-redshift type I AGN, indicating that exponential profiles are not unique to LRDs. They are both extremely X-ray weak, show strong auroral [OIII] 4363 emission, weak hot dust mid-IR emission, and no time variability. However, they differ in terms of excitation diagnostics: the HeII 4686 line is undetected in the Red Rosetta but strongly detected in the Blue Rosetta in both narrow and broad components, with the latter much broader than hydrogen Balmer lines. This supports BLR stratification and disfavors the cocoon electron-scattering scenario. An additional difference is the presence of prominent Balmer absorption in the Red Rosetta -- indicative of extremely dense gas along the line of sight -- but absent in the Blue Rosetta. Taken together, these results suggest that LRDs and LBDs share the same central engine as standard type I AGN, while differing in the amount and geometry of dense gas surrounding the accretion disk, and/or in their accretion properties.</description>

      <title>The Perpendicularity of Dust Lanes and Radio Jets in Early-Type Galaxies: Implications for AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orientation of radio jets relative to their host galaxies offers an interesting avenue for probing the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their surroundings. Several studies have also investigated the orientation of nuclear dust features. We follow up on this previous work with newer Hubble Space Telescope imaging of early-type radio galaxies, and a largely automated process for measuring position angles. We classify the dust features as lanes, disks, or rings. Lanes are irregular structures that likely form from gas-rich minor mergers, while disks and rings are more well-defined and may form from settling lanes or internal mechanisms. We find that dust lanes do not have a preferred alignment relative to their host galaxies, but are preferentially perpendicular to the jets. In contrast, dust disks and rings tend to be closely aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies, but have varying orientations relative to the jets. Our results suggest that infalling dusty material from mergers can influence the angle of the radio jet. This would allow the jet orientation to change over time, and may help explain the role of AGN feedback in maintaining quiescence in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Physical Nature of Polar Ring Galaxies from H I Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar ring galaxies (PRGs) host an outer ring of gas and stars oriented nearly perpendicular to the main stellar body. They represent extreme examples of misaligned systems and provide valuable insight into galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and peculiar gas dynamics. We compile a complete sample of kinematically confirmed PRGs and collect their H I measurements. Combining literature data with new observations from FAST, we detect H I emission in 22 sources, identify one potential H I absorption feature, and find four non-detections among 40 confirmed PRGs. Compared to galaxies in the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, PRGs predominantly occupy the green valley or quenched regimes but exhibit higher gas fractions than typical early-type galaxies, suggesting gas accretion. The H I profile asymmetry and shape for PRGs are not consistent with that of the ALFALFA sample with p&lt;0.05. We examine their Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and baryonic TFR (bTFR), linking the systems' rotation velocities to their masses. The extreme outliers in TFRs for the control sample tend to display single-peaked H I profiles. PRGs do not follow a tight TFR or bTFR if the H I resides primarily in the host galaxy. But the scatter decreases significantly if we assume the gas is mainly distributed in the polar ring. Spatially resolved H I observations are essential to disentangle the gas distribution and kinematics in PRGs, which are key to understanding their formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Obscured AGN at z &lt; 1.5: X-ray to Far-Infrared SEDs and Host Galaxy Morphologies in the GOODS Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), galaxy light profiles, and visual morphological classifications for 194 X-ray luminous AGN (intrinsic absorption-corrected log10 LX(0.5 to 7 keV) less than 42.5, with a maximum of 45.2 ergs per second) at redshift z less than 1.5 in the GOODS fields. We generate X-ray to far-infrared SEDs normalized at 1 micron for all AGN and sort them according to their emission slopes in the ultraviolet and infrared. We visually classify their host galaxy morphologies and compute their bulge-to-total light ratios using the software Galaxy Shapes of Light (galight). Most (94 percent) GOODS AGN exhibit obscured SEDs, defined by diminished ultraviolet and/or mid-infrared emission, while only 6 percent show unobscured, quasar-like SEDs. Secular processes appear to play a large role in stimulating AGN emission, as only around one-third of galaxies are undergoing interactions. We also describe the morphological identification of a population of suspected post-merger spheroid galaxies with obscured ultraviolet and infrared SEDs, and distinguish them from the host galaxies of AGN with less obscuration in the ultraviolet or infrared.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project II: MODS Spectra, Physical Conditions, and Oxygen Abundances in Local Metal-Poor Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirically measuring the primordial He mass fraction, $Y_{\rm p}$, requires a significant number of low-metallicity nebulae with direct constraints on He/H and O/H abundances. This technique requires high-fidelity measurements of the gas-phase physical conditions, namely the electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$). To this end, we present deep rest-optical spectroscopy for a sample of 62 low-metallicity ($\lesssim$ 20% solar O/H) galaxies acquired using the Multi-Object Double Spectrographs (MODS) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) as part of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project. We discuss new fitting methods that recover the intensity of up to 61 H and He recombination lines, of which, up to 26 will be used to determine gas-phase He abundances, and we examine the emission line properties of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project sample. We assess different scaling relations in the low-metallicity interstellar medium (ISM), finding that $n_e$[Ar IV] measured in 31 targets is systematically larger than $n_e$[S II] or $n_e$[O II]. The larger densities are insufficient to significantly bias $T_e$[O III] or the O/H abundance. $T_e$[S III] and $T_e$[O III] are strongly correlated over a range of $\sim$10$^4$ K with very low scatter, and we calibrate new $T_e$[S III]-$T_e$[O III] scaling relations for use in other low-metallicity environments. We examine different $T_e$ measured in the low-ionization gas, finding significant scatter compared to $T_e$[O III]. The precision direct O/H derived in this analysis (median uncertainty $\sim$4%) are consistent with prior literature measurements, albeit with relatively large scatter. These data provide a key component necessary to empirically measure $Y_{\rm p}$ and the abundance patterns of other elements in the ISM.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project III: LUCI Spectra of Metal-Poor Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the elemental abundances of a low metallicity nebula strongly depends on measuring the density (n$_e$) and temperature (T$_e$) of the gas. Because these two parameters are inherently degenerate when derived solely from H and He recombination lines, we rely on the density-sensitive HeI $\lambda$10830 line to assist in resolving this issue, especially for accurate He abundances. To facilitate this, we present near-IR (NIR) LUCI spectra of 48 low-metallicity targets from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and homogeneously reduce them using Pypeit as part of the LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project. IR spectra require special care, and we wavelength calibrate by-hand using the bright OH emission lines, carefully apply proper telluric corrections, and co-add the spectra of LUCI1 and LUCI2 on a resampled grid to ensure accurate results. We use a Gaussian profile to fit the emission lines and measure the fluxes relative to Paschen-gamma (P$\gamma$), resulting in HeI $\lambda$10830 to P$\gamma$ ratios consistent with previous studies. As a result, this work significantly expands the available dataset of NIR HeI $\lambda$10830 fluxes in low metallicity galaxies. These high-quality measurements, where we find a median flux ratio uncertainty of $\widetilde{\sigma} = 0.08$, reduce the overall uncertainties in helium abundance estimates for individual targets. The increased size of the high-quality sample enables searching for systematic uncertainties and improves the reliability of the helium abundance determinations used to infer the primordial helium abundance ($Y_{\rm p}$).</description>

      <title>Fast, dust-poor outflows in the local candidate dual AGN MCG-03-34-64 observed with VLT/ERIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VLT/ERIS IFU J-band observations of MCG-03-34-64, a nearby (z = 0.0167) Seyfert galaxy hosting a candidate dual AGN system with a separation of ~100 pc between the nuclei. The observations cover, among others, the HeI1.083um, [FeII]1.257um and Pa$\beta$ emission lines, over a FoV of 3"x3"(~1x1 kpc$^2$). We analyse the ionised gas kinematics and identify two regions with enhanced velocity dispersion (W80~1500 km/s), suggestive of fast outflowing gas, spatially coincident with the position of the two candidate active nuclei. The spectra of the two outflows show a prominent blueshifted wing with velocities vmax ~ -1700 km/s corresponding to the highest 2-5 percentiles of samples of local AGN with similar bolometric luminosities. For the ionised phase of the two outflows, we derive comparable masses of $(4\pm1)\times 10^5$ $M_{\odot}$ and mass outflow rates of $20\pm5$ $M_{\odot}$/yr. The two distinct outflows could be associated with the two nuclei, or be generated by the interaction of the radio jet with the ISM. We also analyse the peculiar profile of the [Fe VII]6087A optical coronal line from an archival VLT/X-shooter spectrum. The comparison with the [NeV]3425A and [FeII]1.257um profiles indicates that [Fe VII] emission likely arises only from the outflow. The absence of the systemic component in [Fe VII] - unlike in [NeV], which has similar ionisation potential and critical density - suggests suppression of [Fe VII] due to iron depletion onto dust grains, while its detection in the outflow implies a lower dust content than in the host ISM. The additional information gained from the ERIS data are consistent with the scenario of a dual AGN, however further observations are required to confirm its nature.</description>

      <title>Older Ages for 23 Pre-Main Sequence Stars in Upper Scorpius Using Dynamical Mass-Constrained Stellar Evolutionary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present revised stellar ages for 23 pre-main sequence K- and M-type stars in the Upper Scorpius star-forming region, derived by using stellar dynamical masses to constrain isochronal ages from five pre-main sequence stellar evolutionary models. We find that mass-constrained stellar ages for all model sets are more consistent with the older, ~8-11 Myr age for Upper Sco derived using earlier-type stars. Additionally, applying the independent mass constraint to isochronal ages tends to 1) increase stellar ages for most model sets, and 2) decrease age scatter for individual sources between model sets. Models that account for global magnetic fields consistently produce the best match to our observations: they change comparatively little when the mass constraint is applied, and produce 9-10 Myr ages under both unconstrained and mass-constrained conditions. Most standard (nonmagnetic) models produce younger ages (3-5 Myr) when unconstrained, but older ages (6-9 Myr) when constrained by dynamical mass. Our results are consistent with literature findings that suggest median disk lifetimes may be &gt;2x longer than previously thought.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS Survey: Extraplanar ionised gas in star-forming galaxies from eDIG to galaxy-scale winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the extraplanar gas, with $\sim$50-200 pc resolution, in nine star-forming galaxies using Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations from the GECKOS VLT Large Program targeting edge-on galaxies with similar stellar mass as the Milky Way. The narrow range in stellar mass ($\pm0.35$ dex) of the GECKOS sample makes it ideal for studying trends with star formation rate (SFR). We find strong extraplanar emission reaching $\sim$2-8 kpc from the disk midplane in all targets with $\rm{SFR}\geq$1 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Targets with SFR$\,\geq\,$5 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ have brighter, more extended H$\alpha$ emission compared to lower SFR targets. In high-SFR systems, the gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$) shows a biconical morphology, consistent with the expectation of outflows. This agrees with previous works suggesting high velocity dispersion in a biconical shape is a good means to identify outflows. We find mixed results using line diagnostics ([OIII]$_{5007}$/H$\beta$ - [NII]/H$\alpha$ and $\sigma_{\rm H\alpha}$ - [SII]/H$\alpha$) to spatially resolve ionisation mechanisms across the extraplanar gas. The highest [NII]/H$\alpha$ are the extraplanar gas of the highest SFR systems, yet main-sequence galaxies have the highest [OIII]/H$\beta$. While the morphology of [NII]/H$\alpha$ may be useful to identify outflows, the absolute value of the line ratio alone may not distinguish strong outflows from extraplanar gas of main-sequence galaxies. The ubiquitous extraplanar emission can be interpreted as the result of feedback, in the form of large-scale winds for starbursts or smaller-scale galactic fountains for main-sequence galaxies. Moreover, shock-heating may ionise gas at the interface of the disk and the circumgalactic medium, independent of the source of the gas.</description>

      <title>Probing Star-Forming Properties via ALMA Observations of Massive Protocluster IRAS 15596-5301</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of star-forming properties, we studied a massive protocluster IRAS 15596-5301 using ALMA 870 um and 3 mm data. High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions. Our results thus indicate that star formation in I15596 is triggered or accelerated by a mild non-head-on collision between two filaments.</description>

      <title>The size-velocity dispersion relationship of Galactic HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size-velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation, while well established for giant HII regions, remains uncertain for their smaller counterparts (physical radii R &lt; 20 pc). Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R &lt; 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (&lt; 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (&gt; 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.</description>

      <title>Statistical study for binary star evolution in dense embedded clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22767v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The dynamical evolution of binary populations in embedded star clusters shapes the statistical properties of binaries observed in the Galactic field. Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.
  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.
  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.
  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.
  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential.</description>

      <title>Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).</description>

      <title>MAGAZ3NE: Dust Deficiency in Ultramassive Quiescent Galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ with ALMA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in identifying massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$ is distinguishing truly passive systems from dust-obscured star-forming galaxies, as both populations exhibit similar red ultraviolet (UV)-to-near-infrared (NIR) colors. In this work, we present ALMA Band 7 dust-continuum observations of five ultramassive galaxies (UMGs; $\log (M_\star / M_\odot) &gt; 11$) spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\rm spec} &gt; 3$ from the MAGAZ3NE survey. Our results reveal that only one galaxy shows a faint 870 \um\ dust continuum detection, while the remaining four UMGs are undetected down to the $3\sigma$ depth . By incorporating ALMA constraints into the spectral energy distribution analysis, we confirm that these UV-NIR-selected systems are truly quiescent UMGs, lying more than one dex below the star-forming main sequence with $\mathrm{\log (sSFR/Gyr^{-1}) &lt; -1}$, thereby ruling out the possibility of obscured star formation. We then estimate dust masses using both spectral energy distribution modeling and modified blackbody fitting, with consistent results between the two methods. We find that three UMGs have evolved into extremely dust-poor quiescent galaxies, with $M_{\mathrm{dust}}/M_\star \lesssim 10^{-4}$, while the ALMA-detected galaxy has a comparatively higher dust reservoir with $M_{\mathrm{dust}}/M_\star \sim 10^{-3}$. Our results present the most massive and extremely dust-poor spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies known at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$, providing valuable observational constraints on rapid dust removal and quenching processes in the early universe. Future molecular line observations will be essential to directly measure the gas content and verify the efficiency of the depletion process.</description>

      <title>Millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy of methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and somewhat larger cyano derivatives were detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 recently. Their formation from smaller hydrocarbons is not well understood, in part because abundances of many species are not known. Methylallene, CH$_3$CHCCH$_2$, may be one of the building blocks, but its rotational spectrum was characterized only to a very limited extent. We recorded rotational transitions in the 36$-$501 GHz region to extend the existing line list of methylallene and thus enable searches for the molecule in space. Quantum-chemical calculations were carried out to evaluate initial spectroscopic parameters. We obtained transition frequencies with $J \le 61$ and $K_a \le 21$ and resolved the internal rotation splitting of the CH$_3$ group at least partially. As a result, a full set of distortion parameters up to sixth order along with two octic ones were determined, as well as parameters describing the internal rotation of the methyl group. The spectroscopic parameters are accurate enough to identify methylallene up to 720 GHz, sufficient for searches even in the warm interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>QSOFEED: Investigating warm molecular, low- and high-ionization atomic gas in six type-2 quasars with GTC/EMIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present long-slit near-infrared spectroscopic observations of six nearby (z$\sim$0.1) radio-quiet type-2 quasars (QSO2s) from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. They have bolometric luminosities of $10^{45-46}~erg~s^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $ 10^{10.6-11.3}~M_{\odot}$. The observations were obtained with the instrument Espectr\'ografo Multiobjeto Infra-Rojo (EMIR) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The nuclear K-band spectra (central $\sim$1-3 kpc of the QSO2s) reveal signatures of high-velocity outflows in either the Pa$\alpha$ or Br$\gamma$ lines, depending on the redshift, and in the [Si VI] lines. The broadest kinematic components have full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim$1200-2500 km $s^{-1}$. From the near-infrared hydrogen recombination lines we derived ionized outflow masses of $M_{Hion} \sim0.08-20\times 10^{6}~M_{\odot}$, mass outflow rates of $\dot{M}_{Hion}\sim0.03-6~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$, and kinetic powers of $\dot{E}_{Hion}\sim 10^{37.8-40.8}~erg~s^{-1}$. These ionized gas outflow masses and mass outflow rates have median values that are 5.9 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than those derived from the [Si VI] line. Our study provides evidence, at least for these six QSO2s, that the near-infrared recombination lines and [Si VI] are tracing the same outflow (i.e., they have similar kinematics and radii), but they carry different amounts of mass. We detected warm molecular lines in the six QSO2s, from which we measured total (nuclear) gas masses from 1.1 (0.7) to 32 (13) $\times~10^3~M_{\odot}$, similar to other QSO2s with warm $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, but we did not find any molecular outflow associated with them. Comparing with other five QSO2s with $H_2$ measurements reported in the literature, we find that the four QSO2s with detected $H_2$ outflows have total (nuclear) $H_2$ masses 2.2 (2.7) times larger, on average.</description>

      <title>G183: An outer galaxy filament feeding a massive protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed multi-tracer observation of a 5-pc long outer Galaxy filament, G183, and the massive young stellar object (YSO) IRAS 05480+2545 associated with it. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope at lambda = 1.4 and 3 mm, we probed the molecular gas distribution at angular resolutions of ~12"-28" (0.1-0.3 pc at d = 2.1 kpc). The velocity-resolved C18O(1-0) observations conclusively show a main filament with a skeleton of ridges. The main filament is a 5 pc long velocity-coherent structure with a continuous and quiescent velocity field along its length up to the star-forming hub that accretes mass from the filament. The internal gas kinematics of most of the G183 filament is dominated by thermal motions (sigma_NT/cs~1) and large-scale velocity gradients arising due to outflows and accretion of matter in the massive YSO. The dispersion-size relation almost up to 1 pc is consistent with Larson's law, suggesting that the origin of the filament is a turbulence cascade. The massive YSO, S1, with no corresponding radio continuum detection is characterized as a high-mass protostellar object with a mass of 156 Msun and an M/L ratio of 0.04. We identify a kinematic signature of the accretion of material from the filament onto the YSO, S1. The rates of molecular gas accretion and entrainment in S1 are estimated to be 8.6 and 2.6 (in units of 10^-4 Msun/yr), respectively. In comparison to the inner Galaxy high-mass star-forming filaments forming massive stars, G183 has a lower column density; however, the accretion and outflow rates in S1 are similar. The detection of hydrocarbons such as CH3CN and HC3N indicates the presence of hot-core chemistry in S1. These results highlight the universality of physical processes involved in massive star formation across a range of Galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning of Extragalactic Stellar Streams: Sculpting a Latent Space of Representations with DES DR2 Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach for characterizing low surface brightness tidal features in wide-field imaging data by applying the nearest-neighbor contrastive learning of visual representations (NNCLR) algorithm to a curated subset of the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2). We construct 38,334 cutouts of well-resolved galaxies in the g, r, i bands, applying a novel "tiered sigmoid scaling function" to dynamically adjust image contrast according to the object's signal-to-noise and background level. A supplemental labeled sample of 366 galaxies enables qualitative assessment of the learned embeddings. We train a convolutional neural network with image augmentations including injection of simulated background stars, and project the resulting 512-dimensional representations into two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and its local density preserving variant (densMAP). We find that the NNCLR latent space recovers global trends corresponding to major merger features, yet does not reliably separate stellar streams without further supervision. To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy. Our study provides a blueprint for leveraging contrastive methods to mine forthcoming survey data for faint tidal substructure, and highlights key preprocessing and interpretability considerations for robust stream detection.</description>

      <title>Too many or too massive? Investigating the high-$z$ demography of active SMBHs from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have unveiled a numerous population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $4&lt; z&lt;10$, with space densities roughly an order of magnitude above pre-JWST estimates, and many of these AGN have masses orders of magnitude above the local black hole mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$) scaling relations. We investigate the consistency of these observations within a data-driven framework that links the galaxy stellar mass function to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function and AGN luminosity functions using different $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations and the observed Eddington-ratio distribution. By comparing our predictions against observed AGN luminosity functions at $z\sim 5.5$ we find that observations can be reproduced either by highly-elevated $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations paired with low duty cycles, or moderate relations with higher duty cycles. Through the Soltan argument, we find that $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations that are modestly above the local relation for AGN produce consistency between multiple tracers of the SMBH demography at $z\sim 5.5$, while more extreme normalisations would require a weakly-evolving luminosity function at $z&gt; 5.5$. Continuity-equation modelling shows that initially high $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations predict a strong two-phase evolutionary scenario and very steep low-mass SMBH mass functions in tension with several current estimates, while more moderate relations generate local SMBH mass functions in better agreement with present determinations and near-constant scaling relations. Our results favour a scenario where SMBHs at $z \sim 5$ on average lie modestly above local AGN scaling relations, with elevated but physically plausible duty cycles. Future wide-field clustering and demographic studies will help break the remaining degeneracies between SMBH scaling relations and AGN duty cycles at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Supermassive Black Hole Pairs on Inclined Orbits in Post-Merger Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of the evolution of supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs in post-merger remnant galaxies are necessary to motivate observational searches for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gravitational wave sources. Studies have explored the dynamical evolution of SMBH pairs under the influence of dynamical friction to calculate pairing times and predict the expected population of dual-AGNs at various redshifts. We formulate a three-dimensional dynamical model of SMBH pairs in the innermost kiloparsec of a post-merger galaxy to investigate the impact of orbital inclination with respect to the galactic disk on pairing times. The SMBH pairs are evolved in 81 different galaxy configurations initialized using a Gauss-Seidel Poisson solver. The dynamics are calculated for 12 distinct initial inclinations ranging from 0 to 75 degrees in each of the galaxies to gauge the impact of inclination on pairing time. Orbits characterized by initial inclinations greater than 20 degrees frequently require longer pairing times when compared to uninclined orbits. Pairing times for orbits with inclinations $\gtrsim 45$ degrees often exceed 14 Gyr. Galaxies with higher mass SMBH pairs and faster rotating disks generally shorten pairing times relative to galaxies with less massive or slower rotating disks when the inclination is $\lesssim 45$ degrees. The model suggests that SMBH pairs that form from mergers at inclinations $\lesssim 20$ degrees are likely progenitors of dual-AGN and gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>MARVELously Dark: the gravothermal evolution of dwarf halos in velocity-dependent SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a sufficiently large cross section has been shown to naturally produce constant dark matter (DM) cores, as well as core-collapse, at the centers of dwarf halos on cosmic timescales, potentially reducing tensions with observation. Here, we present halos from a new dark matter only (DMO) cosmological (SIDM) simulation: Ms.Marvel DMO with a velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section with $\sigma/m_\text{max} = 50$ cm$^2$/g at $v_\text{max} = 35$ km/s. We compare these to the CDM suite of Storm simulations including both DMO and dark matter + hydrodynamics runs, in order to test core-formation (and core-collapse) across different dark matter models. We show that Ms.Marvel DMO can reproduce core slopes consistent with observations of isolated dwarf galaxies and more massive ($\text{M}_{vir} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) CDM dwarf halos that include stellar feedback from the matched CDM run (Storm CDM+baryons). We identify nine Ms.Marvel SIDM DMO halos in the core-collapse phase of gravothermal evolution with halo masses below $2\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. We find that using core slope to measure the core-collapse timescales of Ms.Marvel DMO halos agrees well with predicted collapse times estimated with the parametric model for SIDM halos introduced by \cite{Yang2023}. Additionally, compared to central density, core slope is less sensitive to both the radius of measurement and halo merger history. These results indicate that the slope of the inner DM density profile more cleanly differentiates core-collapsed versus core-forming halos than central density amplitude.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All: XVIII. The evolution of the PAH ionisation and PAH size distribution across the Orion Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the PAH population's charge state and size across key physical zones in the Orion Bar, which include the HII region, the atomic PDR (APDR), and three HI/H2 dissociation fronts (DF1, DF2, and DF3). Utilising the NASA Ames PAH Infrared Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) and the pyPAHdb spectral modelling tool, we analysed the MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the "PDRs4All" ERS Program. pyPAHdb modelling reveals the fractional contribution of the different PAH charge states and sizes to the total PAH emission across the Orion Bar. Cationic PAH emission peaks in the APDR region, where neutral PAHs have minimal contribution. Emission from neutral PAHs peaks in the HII region that consists of emission from a face-on PDR associated to the background OMC-1 molecular cloud, and in the molecular cloud regions past DF2. PAH anions are observed deep within the DF2 and DF3 zones. The average PAH size ranges between ~$60-74$ Nc. The modelling reveals regions of top-down PAH formation at the ionisation front, and bottom-up PAH formation within the molecular cloud region. The PAH ionisation parameter $\gamma$ ranges between ~$2-9 x 10^4$. Intensity ratios tracing PAH ionisation scale well with $\gamma$ in regions encompassing edge-on or face-on PDR emission, but their correlation weakens within the molecular cloud zone. Modelling of the $5-15$ $\mu$m PAH spectrum with pyPAHdb achieves comprehensive characterization of the net contribution of neutral and cationic PAHs across different environments, whereas empirical PAH proxy intensity ratio tracers can be highly variable and unreliable outside regions dominated by PDR emission. The derived average PAH size in the different physical zones is consistent with a view of PAHs being more extensively subjected to ultraviolet processing closer to the ionisation front, and less affected within the molecular cloud.</description>

      <title>Comparison of MOND and Verlinde's emergent gravity in dwarf spheroidals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Verlinde's emergent gravity separately to calculate the radial accelerations in 23 dwarf spheroidals. Then, we compare them with the observed radial accelerations. In our earlier work, we determined that, when the data set is considered in its entirety without isolating individual dwarf spheroidal, Verlinde's emergent gravity is in close agreement with the observed values. In the present work, we additionally confirm that, for 21 of the 23 samples examined, Verlinde's emergent gravity follows the trend of the observed values within each dwarf spheroidal more closely than MOND. Combining the statistical significance of all the 23 samples, ranging from $-0.25\sigma$ to 3.41$\sigma$, we conclude that Verlinde's emergent gravity is favored over MOND at 5.2$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Physically-motivated priors in the local distance ladder significantly reduce the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinations of the Hubble constant based on the local distance ladder remain in significant tension with early-Universe inferences from the cosmic microwave background. While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \, \sigma$ to $2 \, \sigma$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods.</description>

      <title>Drifters on the edge of town: $\lambda$ Bo\"otis stars in clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\lambda$ Bo\"otis stars are a subset of chemically peculiar A-stars that display Solar abundances in lighter elements (C, N, O, S, etc.) but a deficiency in Iron-peak elements. This difference has been attributed to the A-stars accreting pristine (metal deficient) gas from the Interstellar Medium. However, the recent discovery of $\lambda$ Bo\"otis stars in clusters challenges this theory, due to the presence of ionising radiation from intermediate/massive ($&gt;$5 M$_\odot$) stars, which could prevent accretion of pristine ISM gas. We use $N$-body simulations to track the dynamical histories of A-stars during the evolution of a star cluster. We find that some stars leave the confines of the cluster and travel beyond the tidal radius, where they may be able to accrete pristine ISM gas. These A-stars then sometimes move back into the inner regions of the cluster, but the photoionising radiation flux they receive is not high enough to prevent $\lambda$ Bo\"otis abundances from occurring in these A-stars. We find that A-stars can develop $\lambda$ Bo\"otis abundances and subsequently form a wide ($&gt;100$ au) binary system, meaning that observations of binary systems that have different abundances between the component stars would not rule out the ISM accretion scenario. Whilst we have shown that $\lambda$ Bo\"otis stars can reside in and around star clusters, further research is required to assess the validity of the accretion rates required to explain their abundance patterns.</description>

      <title>Observational Implications of Cosmic Ray-Inverse Compton 'Boosted' Cool Cores in Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray luminous cool-core (CC) galaxy clusters contain powerful cosmic ray (CR) sources. High-energy CRs powering GHz synchrotron lose energy rapidly, but long-lived (~Gyr-old) populations of 0.1-1 GeV CRs persist, propagating to ~100 kpc distances and radiating via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons. We explore observable consequences of such CR-IC emission. This produces remarkably thermal X-ray spectra, which could contribute significantly to emission in CC centers. These naturally connect to ultra-steep radio sources and radio mini-halos at younger ages, but become undetectable in most radio, hard-X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray searches (though future imaging may detect them), while reproducing apparent density, temperature, entropy, and mass deposition rates of CCs. This would provide an alternative resolution of the cooling flow problem: clusters may appear as strong CCs because of strong CR-IC, while not actually cooling so rapidly. This predicts many observed correlations between AGN/jet properties, radio galaxy and minihalo properties, cooling radii, cavity radii and apparent X-ray cooling luminosity $L_{\rm X,cool}$. Since $L_{\rm X,cool}$ is actually from CR-IC, the observed radio-X-ray ($L_{\rm radio}-L_{\rm X,cool}$), apparent cavity power ($P_{\rm cav}-L_{\rm X,cool}-L_{\rm radio}$), and strong CC-AGN correlations are predicted without free parameters. Since CR-IC leads to X-ray overestimates of thermal pressure, the ratio of SZ to X-ray pressures should drop in CC centers. CR-IC also suppresses abundances inferred from X-ray relative to optical/UV measurements in CC centers. Both of these appear to be seen in sufficiently-resolved CCs. Effects on cluster cosmology, hydrostatic mass estimation, and non-thermal pressure/turbulence estimators are small. Redshift evolution of CC surface brightness profiles could provide strong constraints or imply CR-IC at high-$z$.</description>

      <title>Mapping dark matter in the Bullet Cluster using JWST imaging and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated gravitational lens model of the Bullet cluster (1E 0657-56) by combining JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Although previous lens models relied on many multiply imaged galaxies, only six systems had spectroscopic redshifts prior to this work. Our lens model is constrained by a catalogue of 135 secure multiple images from 27 background galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, uniformly covering both subclusters and a wide redshift range of 0.9 - 6.7. We also provide a catalogue of 199 multiple image candidates. We model the cluster with Lenstool and incorporate several large-scale haloes, cluster members, the intracluster gas, and group-scale haloes surrounding the cluster core, motivated by spectroscopic studies of cluster member kinematics. We describe the main cluster component with a complex, elongated double-peaked distribution, and the subcluster with a single large-scale halo aligning closely with the brightest cluster galaxy ($4_{-2}^{+4}$ kpc). The uncertainty of the alignment is improved threefold with the addition of JWST systems. The addition of group-scale substructures, roughly following the two axes of cluster assembly, improves the fit to the multiple image positions and provides a physically motivated alternative to constant shear. Our lens model shows the closest agreement with previous studies in aperture mass profiles at $\sim60$ kpc from the BCGs, but exhibits significant differences in the detailed mass distribution as a result of different lens-modelling strategies and adopted constraints. The differences are reflected in small but spatially coherent deviations between the new spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts predicted by earlier lens models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling BLR Structure in AGN with High Resolution X-Ray Spectra: An Analytic Approach to Wind Emission Line Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XRISM has provided an unprecedented view of the emission and absorption lines in the X-ray. Notably, early results showed significant complexity to the Fe-K$\alpha$ line profile in AGN, with clear contributions from at least three emitting structures: an inner disc, intermediary broad line region (BLR) scale material, and an outer torus. This poses a new challenge for the modelling of the emission lines, as while fast sophisticated models exist for disc line-profiles, large scale-height material is typically much more complex. In this paper we aim to address this gap, by building a fully analytic model for the emission line profiles from a wind, aimed towards BLR scale material, motivated on previous reverberation studies suggesting a wind on the inner edge of the BLR. Our approach gives a physically motivated, yet computationally fast, model for the intermediary component to the Fe-K$\alpha$ complex seen in the XRISM data. We demonstrate our model on the XRISM observations of NGC 4151 from the performance verification phase, showing that it gives a good description of the data, with physically reasonable parameters for BLR scale material. We also show that our model naturally gives the smooth line profile seen in the data, due to the large spatial extent of a wind. Finally, we make our model code public to the community, and name it xwind.</description>

      <title>SED and Galactic kinematic diagnostics for dormant BH/NS binary candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third data release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR3) has enabled large-scale searches for dormant black hole and neutron star binaries with stellar companions at wide separations. A recent study has proposed thousands of dormant black hole and neutron star binary candidates using summary statistics from Gaia DR3 by simulating and fitting Gaia observables. In this Letter, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the optical to the infrared for 1,328 candidates, incorporating GALEX ultraviolet photometry to assess the presence of hidden hot companions. We quantify ultraviolet excess by comparing observed near-ultraviolet fluxes with single-star SED predictions and further test whether excesses can be explained by non-degenerate stellar companions for sources exhibiting moderate excess. We additionally examine the Galactic kinematics of the sample to identify systems potentially affected by natal kicks during compact-object formation. By combining the ultraviolet and kinematic diagnostics, we identify 176 sources as the highest-priority candidates for follow-up observations, in which 19 are black hole candidates with previously provided masses $\geq$ 3 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the nature of dark matter by mapping cosmic filaments from Lyman-alpha emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model predicts that cosmic filaments are highly clumpy, whereas warm dark matter -- invoked to address small-scale challenges in $\Lambda$CDM -- produces filaments that are noticeably smoother and less structured. In this work, we investigate the potential of Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission to trace cosmic filaments at redshifts $z=2.5$ and $z=4$, and assess their potential for constraining the nature of dark matter. Our analysis shows that Ly$\alpha$ filaments provide a promising observational probe of dark matter: at $z=4$, differences in filament smoothness and surface brightness serve as distinctive signatures between models. Looking ahead, the upcoming generation of 30-meter class telescopes will be critical for enabling these measurements, offering a compelling opportunity to distinguish the nature of dark matter by mapping the structure of cosmic filaments.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that Eddington-like accretion event in the Galactic center several million years ago and particle acceleration at accompanying shocks and jets could explain the observed cosmic ray spectrum at energies above 1 PeV. Cosmic ray particles are confined in extended (several hundred kiloparsec in size) Galactic halo. It is shown that the halo magnetic field could be as small as $2\times 10^{-7}$ G for the effective confinement.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the C/O ratio in the planet-forming environments around very-low-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The material in planet-forming disks determines the composition of planets; hence, it is crucial to understand the physical and chemical processes that set the abundance and distribution of key volatiles. James Webb Space Telescope observations of disks around very-low-mass ($\sim0.1~M\odot$) stars (VLMS) have revealed their hydrocarbon-rich inner regions (e.g., $\mathrm{C_2H_2}$), with column densities significantly higher than predicted. We employ chemical kinetics models using the physical structure of the inner disk around an M~Dwarf star with an X-ray luminosity of $L_X\sim10^{29}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. We adopt initial abundances that mimic the effects of carbon enhancement and oxygen depletion (C/O from 0.44 to 87.47) and quantify how the abundances and distributions of key volatiles respond. The column density and number of molecules ($\mathcal{N}$) of hydrocarbons and oxygen-bearing species are highly sensitive to the C/O ratio, with the largest increases in hydrocarbons occurring when carbon increases by a factor of 2, and/or oxygen decreases by a factor of 10, relative to solar. In the IR-emitting region ($T_\mathrm{gas}&gt;200$~K), a range of C/O ratios can reproduce the observed $\mathcal{N}$ and ratios relative to $\mathrm{CO_2}$. The disk-integrated molecular ratio with respect to $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is highly sensitive to the underlying C/O ratio. However, our results apply only to a source with a single X-ray luminosity value at the middle of that observed for VLMS; hence, a degeneracy between the stellar $L_X$ and the C/O ratio cannot be discarded. Nonetheless, our findings support that an enhanced C/O is required to drive the hydrocarbon-rich chemistry observed in the inner disks around VLMS.</description>

      <title>Physical origin of very-high-energy gamma rays from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4278 and implications for neutrino observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to accelerate particles to extreme energies, yet the physical origin of very-high-energy (VHE) emission from low-luminosity AGNs (LL AGNs) remains unclear. NGC 4278, a local LLAGN, has recently been identified as a VHE source following detections by LHAASO. In this study, we present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger analysis to investigate the physical origin of this emission. Swift-XRT monitoring reveals a quasi-quiescent state characterized by a low X-ray flux. Modeling the broadband spectral energy distribution with the leptohadronic code AMES, we find that a standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model underpredicts the VHE flux by $\sim$70% due to the insufficient target photon density provided by the weak X-ray emission, unless a high Doppler factor ($\delta \gtrsim 5$) is invoked. Alternatively, an external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario-scattering seed photons from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF)-successfully reproduces the broadband spectral energy distribution with a modest jet power and Doppler factor. We further explore the neutrino production within a leptohadronic framework. The predicted muon neutrino event rate is highest in the EIC quiescent model, reaching $N_{\nu_{\mu}} \sim 0.001$ for a 15-year IceCube observation (assuming 0.1% of the Eddington luminosity is partitioned into high-energy protons). Future multi-messenger observations are essential to unveil the details of the high-energy processes of NGC 4278.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Star Formation and Feedback Recipes on the Stellar Mass and Interstellar Medium of High-Redshift Galaxies</title>

Abstract: We introduce MEGATRON, a new galaxy formation model for cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of high-redshift galaxies. The model accounts for the non-equilibrium chemistry and heating/cooling processes of $\geq 80$ atoms, ions, and molecules, coupled to on-the-fly radiation transfer. We apply the model in a cosmological setting to the formation of a $10^9\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$ halo at $z=6$, and run 25 realizations at pc-scale resolution, varying numerous parameters associated with our state-of-the-art star formation, stellar feedback, and chemical enrichment models. We show that the overall budget of feedback energy is the key parameter that controls star formation regulation at high redshift, with other numerical parameters (e.g. supernova clustering, star formation conditions) having a more limited impact. As a similar feedback model has been shown to produce realistic $z=0$ galaxies, our work demonstrates that calibration at $z=0$ does not guarantee strong regulation of star formation at high-redshift. Interestingly, we find that subgrid model variations that have little impact on the final $z=6$ stellar mass can lead to substantial changes on the observable properties of high-redshift galaxies. For example, different star formation models based on, e.g. density thresholds or turbulence inspired criteria, lead to fundamentally distinct nebular emission line ratios across the interstellar medium (ISM). These results highlight the ISM as an important resource for constraining models of star formation, feedback, and galaxy formation in the JWST era, where emission line measurements for $&gt;1,000$ high-redshift galaxies are now available.</description>

      <title>EIGER VIII: First stars signatures in the connection between OI absorption and Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\sim35\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\gtrsim 2\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\log(N_{\rm CII}/N_{\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis at the outskirts of galaxy overdensities.. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Transformation -- Understanding the SMC's Structural and Kinematic Disequilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SMC is in disequilibrium. Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/\sigma\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R&gt;2$ kpc, and a small ($&lt;10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R&lt;2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>How is Cold Gas Loaded into Galactic Nuclear Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the multiphase gas within the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles is crucial for understanding Galactic Center (GC) feedback. We use HI4PI data to investigate the kinematics and physical properties of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) toward the GC. Our results reveal that the HVCs exhibit a distinct asymmetric distribution, closely associated with the bar-driven tilted dust lanes and the distorted overshooting streams. We propose that powerful nuclear outflows interact with these gas-rich, off-plane structures, striping and entraining cold gas from the outer Galactic regions (R_GC~0.5--1.7 kpc) rather than solely from the region of the central molecular zone (CMZ; R_GC&lt;0.3 kpc). In this scenario, as the Galactic bar drives gas inflows along the dust lanes, nuclear outflows simultaneously break through the CMZ, sweeping up and ablating cold gas from the boundary layer of these pre-existing structures. This process naturally accounts for the observed high turbulence, complex spectral signatures, and anomalous spatial-kinematic gas patterns, as well as multiwavelength asymmetries of the bubbles. The HVCs are accelerated to about 230--340 km/s over a dynamical time of ~3--6 Myr. When the multiphase, inhomogeneous composition of the gas is included, the estimated gas outflow rate reaches ~1 Msun/yr. This value is comparable to the bar-driven inflow rate, indicating a tightly coupled gas cycle in the inner Galaxy. Our research highlights the critical role of bar-driven gas dynamics and nuclear feedback in the secular evolution of the Milky Way, offering a valuable paradigm for investigating gas cycles in external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey: A new three-ringed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUI- JOTE line survey. We detected 22 independent lines corresponding to 88 rotational transitions with quantum numbers ranging from J=19 up to J=24 and Ka &lt;= 5 in the Q-band range. The identification of this new PAH was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The column density derived for 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene is (6.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2, with a rotational temperature of 9 K. Its abundance is high, as is that of the rest of the PAHs, but it is the lowest of all those detected to date in TMC-1, being 2.66 times less abundant than indene and 4.66 times less than phenalene. This result will help us to better understand the growth of five- and six-membered rings in dark clouds. Chemical models explaining their formation through the bottom-up model are still very incomplete and require further experimental and theoretical effort. Even so, the most likely formation reactions would occur between the smallest rings with small hydrocarbons; the most probable reaction for the formation of cyclopentindene is that between indene and C2H, C2H3, and/or their cation.</description>

      <title>Radio-Near Infrared Imaging of Dual Active Galactic Nuclei Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of a pilot study that searched for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in local ($z&lt;$0.25) galaxies hosting double-peaked narrow emission lines in their optical spectra. We present high-resolution $L-$band (1.5 GHz or 18 cm) continuum images from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) as well as WFC3/IR F160W images from the Hubble Space Telescope of two candidate dual AGN systems: J0948+6848 and J1223+5409. In both targets, we detected compact non-thermal radio emission that is approximately co-spatial with the near-infrared AGN. Both systems host two high brightness temperature ($&gt;10^{8}$ K) radio sources that indicate the presence of either a parsec-scale-separation dual AGN ($d_{\text{sep}} \sim 90$ pc and $\sim 56$ pc, respectively) or a radio jet. Matched-resolution multi-band radio observations are necessary to further characterize the AGN activity in these systems.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XX: Component-separated maps of polarized CMB and thermal dust emission using Planck and BICEP/Keck Observations through the 2018 Observing Season</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present component-separated polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic thermal dust emission, derived using data from the BICEP/Keck experiments through the 2018 observing season and Planck. By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>
