      <title>$k$-Approval Veto: A Spectrum of Voting Rules Balancing Metric Distortion and Minority Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of single-winner ranked-choice elections between $m$ candidates, we explore the tradeoff between two competing goals in every democratic system: the majority principle (maximizing the social welfare) and the minority principle (safeguarding minority groups from overly bad outcomes).To measure the social welfare, we use the well-established framework of metric distortion subject to various objectives: utilitarian (i.e., total cost), $\alpha$-percentile (e.g., median cost for $\alpha = 1/2$), and egalitarian (i.e., max cost). To measure the protection of minorities, we introduce the $\ell$-mutual minority criterion, which requires that if a sufficiently large (parametrized by $\ell$) coalition $T$ of voters ranks all candidates in $S$ lower than all other candidates, then none of the candidates in $S$ should win. The highest $\ell$ for which the criterion is satisfied provides a well-defined measure of mutual minority protection (ranging from 1 to $m$).
  Our main contribution is the analysis of a recently proposed class of voting rules called $k$-Approval Veto, offering a comprehensive range of trade-offs between the two principles. This class spans between Plurality Veto (for $k=1$) - a simple voting rule achieving optimal metric distortion - and Vote By Veto (for $k=m$) which picks a candidate from the proportional veto core. We show that $k$-Approval Veto has minority protection at least $k$, and thus, it accommodates any desired level of minority protection. However, this comes at the price of lower social welfare. For the utilitarian objective, the metric distortion increases linearly in $k$. For the $\alpha$-percentile objective, the metric distortion is the optimal value of 5 for $\alpha \ge k/(k+1)$ and unbounded for $\alpha &lt; k/(k+1)$. For the egalitarian objective, the metric distortion is the optimal value of 3 for all values of $k$.</description>

      <title>On Pareto-Optimal and Fair Allocations with Personalized Bi-Valued Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$ agents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent $i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i &gt; b_i &gt; 0$ to each good, indicating that agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For convenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.
  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our characterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given allocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the general case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision problem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this decision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's value for each good belongs to $\{a,b,c\}$ for some prescribed $a&gt;b&gt;c\geq0$), and this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in our model is the same for each agent).
  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in polynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which extends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem of whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be computed in polynomial time).</description>

      <title>Explainable Graph Neural Networks via Structural Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.</description>

      <title>Online Housing Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an online variant of the celebrated housing market problem, where each agent has a single house and seeks to exchange it for another based on her preferences. In this online setting, agents may arrive and depart at any time, meaning that not all agents are present on the housing market simultaneously. I extend the well known serial dictatorship and Gale s top trading cycle mechanisms to this online scenario, aiming to retain their desirable properties such as Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy proofness. These extensions also seek to prevent agents from strategically delaying their arrival or advancing their departure. I demonstrate that achieving all of these properties simultaneously is impossible in the online context, and I present several variants that achieve different subsets of these properties.</description>

      <title>Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.
  We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.
  We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\alpha \in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\alpha$. Our algorithm achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.</description>
