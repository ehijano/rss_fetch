      <title>Perturbing AGN Accretion Disks with Stars and Moderately Massive Black Holes: Implications for Changing-Look AGN and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model that explains some extreme variability phenomena observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this model, an orbiting companion interacts with the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This interaction excites spiral density waves, leading to bursts of mass inflow lasting a few orbital timescales, whose mass content depends sensitively on the sphere of influence of the orbiting companion. To explain changing-look (CL) AGN, we find that lighter SMBH companions are necessary, while we generally exclude stellar companions. The moderately massive black hole perturber must be on a highly eccentric orbit in order to account for the non-repeating nature of most CL AGN. When applied to quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), we find that stars with highly eccentric orbits and close pericenter passages can produce accretion flares with QPE-like characteristics. For many QPEs, low-mass main-sequence stars or stripped-envelope stars are required. Although moderately massive black hole perturbers could also match the observed properties of QPEs, the gravitational-wave merger timescales of such binary systems are prohibitively short.</description>

      <title>A Radio-quiet AGN as a candidate counterpart to neutrino event IceCube-200615A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Follow-up observations of neutrino events have been a promising method for identifying sources of very-high-energy cosmic rays. Neutrinos are unambiguous tracers of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays. On June 15, 2020, IceCube detected a neutrino event with an 82.8% probability of being astrophysical in origin. To identify the astrophysical source of the neutrino, we used X-ray tiling observations to identify potential counterpart sources. We performed additional multiwavelength follow-up with NuSTAR and the VLA in order to construct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the most likely counterpart. From the SED, we calculate an estimate for the neutrinos we expect to detect from the source. While the source does not have a high predicted neutrino flux, it is still a plausible neutrino emitter. It is important to note that the other bright X-ray candidate sources consistent with the neutrino event are also radio-quiet AGN. A statistical analysis shows that 1RXS J093117.6+033146 is the most likely counterpart (87.5%) if the neutrino is cosmic in origin and if it is among X-ray detectable sources. This results adds to previous results suggesting a connection between radio-quiet AGN and IceCube neutrino events.</description>

      <title>Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. II: Lightcurve Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of &gt;3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.</description>

      <title>The unusual spectrum of the X-ray transient source XRISM J174610.8-290021 near the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic center region was observed with the XRISM X-ray observatory during the performance verification phase in 2024 and a point-like X-ray source was detected with the X-ray imager Xtend at a position of (RA, Dec)=(17h46m10.8s, -29{\deg}00'21''), which is thus named XRISM J174610.8-290021. This source was bright in February to March and showed time variations in count rate by more than one order of magnitude in one week. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity was ~$10^{35}$ erg/s for the assumed distance of 8 kpc. However, after six months, it was below the detection limit. We found a hint of periodicity of 1537 s from timing analysis. The XRISM/Xtend spectrum has emission lines from helium-like iron (Fe He$\alpha$) at 6.7 keV and hydrogen-like iron (Fe Ly$\alpha$) at 6.97 keV; their intensity ratio is unusual with the latter being four times stronger than the former. If the emission is of thermal origin, the ionization temperature estimated from the iron-line intensity ratio is ~30 keV, which is inconsistent with the electron temperature estimated from the thermal bremsstrahlung, ~7 keV. Spectral models of magnetic cataclysmic variables, which are often seen in the Galactic center in this luminosity range, are found to fail to reproduce the obtained spectrum. By contrast, we found that the spectrum is well reproduced with the models of low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star plus two narrow Gaussian lines. We consider that the source is intrinsically bright reaching $10^{37}$ erg/s, but is blocked from direct view due to a high inclination and only the scattered emission is visible. The photoionized plasma above the accretion disk with an ionization parameter of ~$10^{5}$ may explain the unusual iron line ratio. We further discuss the potential contribution of point sources of the type of XRISM J174610.8-290021 to the diffuse Galactic center X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Microquasar jet-cocoon systems as PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-band variability and mode switching in the candidate transitional millisecond pulsar 3FGL J1544.6-1125</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most extensive high-time resolution multi-band campaign to date on the candidate transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) 3FGL J1544.6-1125 in the sub-luminous disk state, with coordinated observations from the radio to the X-ray band. While XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray light curves exhibit the characteristic high- and low-mode bimodality, the source faintness prevents firm evidence for similar bimodality in the ultraviolet and near-infrared light curves, presented here for the first time. A re-analysis of archival XMM-Newton/OM data reveals an optical flare without an X-ray counterpart, likely originating from the outer accretion disk or the companion star. During our observations, no radio emission was detected, with a 3$\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 8 $\mu$Jy at 6 GHz. While past works have already reported radio variability in the source, this limit is a factor of 3.5 below the average value measured in 2019 in similar conditions, underscoring significant radio variability despite the relatively stable X-ray flux. Simultaneous optical light curves in five filters with GTC/HiPERCAM revealed flickering and dipping activities that resemble the observed X-ray variability, along with a reddening trend at lower fluxes. The latter is consistent with discrete mass ejections that disrupt the inner flow and reduce both X-ray and optical fluxes, thereby driving the high-to-low-mode switches. This suggests a common origin for most optical and X-ray emission at the boundary region between the pulsar wind and the inner disk, as also supported by our modelling of the spectral energy distribution in the high mode. Overall, our findings reinforce the mini-pulsar nebula picture for tMSPs in the sub-luminous state and demonstrate how coordinated, high-time resolution, multi-wavelength campaigns are essential to probe the processes governing rapid mode switches in these systems.</description>

      <title>The peak flux of long gamma-ray bursts in the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ diagram and in the classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) is regarded as a fundamental correlation for standardizing LGRBs to probe cosmology and constrain LGRB physics. However, this correlation may be affected by potential selection effects which are likely overlooked in the current small LGRB redshift sample. In this work, we simulate a large LGRB sample that reflects the observed situation, aiming to study the impact of peak flux $P$ on the observed LGRB E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation. We find that the overall (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) distribution, which will directly affect the best-fit result of the correlation, is significantly dependent on the value of $P$. This indicates that the impact of peak flux selection should be carefully considered in the studies and applications of the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ correlation. Notably, we show that our simulated data can reproduce the observed $P$ distribution only if some dependence of (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) is included in the simulation. This is an indication that the (E$_{\rm p,i}$, L$_{\rm iso}$) connection is a crucial property of LGRBs. We also find that GRBs with high peak flux in the low-E$_{\rm p,i}$ &amp; L$_{\rm iso}$ region are not the straightforward extrapolation of the GRB population in the higher-E$_{\rm p,i}$ &amp; L$_{\rm iso}$ region. Selecting four bursts with $ L_{\rm iso}\le10^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$, $E_{\rm p, i}\le10^{2.5}$ keV, and $P\ge10^{0.5}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, we find two bursts, GRB 060614 and GRB 191019A, which may not be associated with the theoretical massive-star origin of LGRBs. This suggests that combining $P$ with the position in the E$_{\rm p,i}$--L$_{\rm iso}$ diagram may be used to indicate alternative LGRB origins.</description>

      <title>Relativistic van Allen belts in magnetospheres of pulsars and white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dynamics and multi-frequency emission patterns of relativistic van Allen belts -
  particles trapped in the magnetosphere of neutron stars and white dwarths. We account for synchrotron radiative losses and effects of relativistic beaming of radiation. The system is non-Hamiltonian (non-energy conserving): this results in a wide non-scalable variety of spectral and temporal behaviors. There are three types of trapped particles' trajectories: (i) oscillating (particles experience multiple bounces between magnetic bottles); (ii) precipitating (particles fall onto the star with finite transverse momentum); (iii) freezing (particles lose their transverse motion before falling onto the star). The separation between regimes (i) and (ii) depends both on the ratio of the bounce time to cooling time at magnetic equator $\tau_{ 0} $, $\eta _0 = R_0/( c \tau_0) \leq 1$, as well as the initial pitch angle $\alpha_0$; regimes (i) and (ii) are separated at $ \alpha_{0, crit} \sim \eta_0^{3/10}$. Resulting emission patterns show large variety: single or double peaked, and/or flat hat with sharp walls. Multi-frequency profiles - in optical and X-ray bands - can be used to get information about physical (magnetic field strength, injection point) and geometrical (dipolar angle and the line of sight) properties.</description>

      <title>{\tt RapidGBM}: An Efficient Tool for Fermi-GBM Visibility Checking and Data Analysis with a Case Study of EP240617a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a lightweight tool {\tt RapidGBM}, featured by a web-based interface and capabilities of rapid calculation of Fermi-GBM visibilities and performing basic data analysis. It has two key features: (1) immediately check the visibility of Fermi-GBM for new transients, and (2) check the light curve and perform spectral analysis after the hourly TTE data is released. The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich GRB (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios. Therefore, {\tt RapidGBM} is expected to assist Einstein Probe Transient Advocates (EP-TAs), Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor Burst Advocates (SVOM-BAs), and other members of the community in cross-checking high-energy transients. Based on prompt emission parameter relations (e.g. $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\gamma,\rm iso}$), it can also help identify peculiar GRBs (e.g. long-short burst, magnetar giant flare, etc.) and and provide useful references (e.g. more accurate $T_0$) for scheduling follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>The Jet Origin of the Mid-infrared Excess in the Black Hole V404 Cygni in Quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of some quiescent black hole X-ray binaries have revealed an excess of mid-infrared (MIR) emission above that expected from their donor stars. In one system, V404 Cygni, this excess has been variously suggested to arise from the accretion disk, circumbinary material, or a compact relativistic jet. Here we present simultaneous James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and complementary multi-wavelength observations undertaken to resolve this uncertainty. We observed large-amplitude 21 $\mu$m variability on short timescales with JWST, particularly a dramatic flare which swiftly rose to $\approx 2.4$ mJy, over 10 times the lowest observed MIR flux density. Similar variability was simultaneously observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths with other facilities throughout the campaign. This variability and the flat radio/mm/MIR spectral index ($\alpha = 0.04 \pm 0.01$) suggest that the MIR excess in V404 Cyg does not arise from the accretion disk or circumbinary material but is instead dominated by synchrotron radiation from a jet which persists into quiescence. This result reinforces the ubiquity of the disk-jet connection in accreting black holes across a range of masses and accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Optical Flares in the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2022tsd ("Tasmanian Devil")</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into a highly magnetized hybrid star (HS) ejects ~ 0.01Msun of outer NS layers with kinetic energy ~ 10^50 erg (Keranen et al. 2005); the Quark-Nova (QN) ejecta. If this occurs in isolation (or after the SN ejecta had dissipated), the rotational energy of the HS powers a transient with rise and decay times of a few days, consistent with Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) (Ouyed 2025). Breakup of the QN ejecta creates optically thin fragments that release trapped radiation over tens of minutes timescales, producing optical flares with luminosities comparable to the LFBOT peak value. X-ray emission arises from HS spin-down energy leaking through the gradually transparent ejecta, while radio emission is due to synchrotron radiation from the ejecta's interaction with the ambient medium. Our model reproduces key features of AT2022tsd and other LFBOTs, including AT2020xnd, AT2020mrf, and AT2018cow. Flares are absent or dwarfed when fragmentation occurs before or during the LFBOT peak emission phase, as likely in AT2018cow. Our model provides a novel explanation for aged NSs with long spin periods that exhibit youthful magnetar-like activity, such as ASKAP J1832-0911 (Wang et al. 2024). It also carries implications for heavy-element enrichment in the universe, given the formation rate of LFBOTs and the neutron-rich composition of the QN ejecta (Jaikumar et al. 2007, Ouyed et al. 2009).</description>

      <title>Excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability around sources of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum (UHECRs) and composition suggests a suppression of the flux below $\sim$1 EeV, as observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. A natural explanation for this phenomenon involves magnetic confinement effects. We investigate the possibility that UHECRs self-generate the magnetic turbulence necessary for such confinement via current-driven plasma instabilities. Specifically, we show that the electric current produced by escaping UHECRs can excite a non-resonant streaming instability in the surrounding plasma. This instability reduces the diffusion coefficient in the source environment, effectively trapping particles with energies $E \lesssim 0.6$ EeV $\mathcal{L}_{45}^{1/2} R_{\text{Mpc}}^{-1} \lambda_{10}^{2}$ for times exceeding the age of the Universe. Here, $\mathcal{L}_{45}$ is the source luminosity in units of $10^{45}$ erg/s, $R_{\text{Mpc}}$ is the radial size in Mpc, and $\lambda_{10}$ is the intergalactic magnetic field coherence length in units of 10 Mpc. We discuss in detail the conditions, in terms of source luminosity, initial magnetic field, and the environment in which this phenomenon occurs, that need to be fulfilled in order for self-confinement to take place near a source of UHECRs. By modeling a population of UHECR sources with a luminosity function typical of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, we connect the spectrum of escaping particles to the luminosity distribution. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of these confined particles to cosmogenic neutrino production, finding consistency with current observational constraints. Our results suggest that self-induced turbulence may play an important role in shaping the UHECR spectrum and, in particular, may account for the flux suppression near their sources, offering a promising framework for interpreting current observations.</description>

      <title>Leading bounds on micro- to picometer fifth forces from neutron star cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence principle and the inverse-square law of gravity could be violated at short distances ($10^{-6}$ to $10^{-12}$ meters) by scalars sporting a coupling $g_N$ to nucleons and mass $\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_\phi\lesssim\rm MeV$. We show for the first time that stringent bounds on the existence of these scalars can be derived from the observed cooling of nearby isolated neutron stars (NSs). Although NSs can only be used to set limits comparable to the classic SN 1987A cooling bound in the case of pseudoscalars such as the QCD axion, the shallow temperature dependence of the scalar emissivity results in a huge enhancement in the effect of $\phi$ on the cooling of cold NSs. As we do not find evidence of exotic energy losses, we can exclude couplings down to $g_N\lesssim 5 \times 10^{-14}$. Our new bound supersedes all existing limits on scalars across six orders of magnitude in $m_\phi$. These conclusions also extend to Higgs-portal models, for which the bound on the scalar-Higgs mixing angle is $\sin\theta\lesssim 6\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and turbulence in magnetically-dominated environments have been proposed as important nonthermal particle acceleration mechanisms that generate high energy particles and associated emissions. While the acceleration to high energy that produces the power-law energy distribution has drawn strong interest, recent studies actively discuss pre-acceleration, or injection, to a sufficient energy for a sustained and prolonged Fermi-like acceleration. The injection process is important for determining the fraction of nonthermal particles and energy partition between thermal and nonthermal particles. We review recent advances in understanding the injection mechanisms responsible for populating these nonthermal power-law spectra, and conclude with an outlook for studies and applications of injection models.</description>

      <title>In-flight calibration of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy</title>

Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), as a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, is the first lobster-eye focusing X-ray telescope with a considerably large field-of-view (FoV) ever flown. During the two and half years of operations, a series of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its performance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we present the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on the properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy response and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the Crab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is found that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the pre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The post-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90% C.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model with the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values, indicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the model predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a systematic of $\lesssim10\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of ~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral analysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors are generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is found to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong modulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively consistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well meet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit calibration of the EP-WXT.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuned Supernova or Failed Explosion? Decoding the Origins of the G3425 Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A binary system (G3425) consisting of a massive unseen component and a red giant star on a nearly circular orbit was recently discovered. The formation of such a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due to the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming the unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body problem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was close to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This provides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the progenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN scenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the secondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is highly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced a black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the secondary are needed. We propose that the unseen component of G3425 is a mass-gap black hole with a mass constrained between the theoretical minimum for failed supernova progenitors (4 MSun) and the observed upper limit (4.4 MSun). Our analysis can be applied to any wide binary system containing an unseen component on a nearly circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.</description>

Abstract: Stars are fossils that retain the history of their host galaxies. Carbon and heavier elements are created inside stars and are ejected when they die. From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible to constrain the physical processes during galaxy formation and evolution. This approach, Galactic archaeology, has been popularly used for our Milky Way Galaxy thanks to a vast amount of data from the Gaia satellite and multi-object spectrographs, and now can also be applied to very distant galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) - extra-galactic archaeology. In these studies the most important factor is the input stellar physics, namely nucleosynthesis yields and binary physics, which predominantly determine the model predictions. In this review I give a summary of stellar nucleosynthesis, and how they are tested with the observations in the Milky Way. Then I show how chemical enrichment of galaxies can be calculated, and show some results with the latest nucleosynthesis yields.</description>

      <title>A Sibling of AR Scorpii: SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8 and the Observational Blueprint of White Dwarf Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio pulsating white dwarf (WD) systems, known as WD pulsars, are non-accreting binary systems where the rapidly spinning WD interacts with a low-mass companion producing pulsed non-thermal emission that can be observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Only two such systems are known: AR Sco and eRASSU J191213.9$-$441044. Here we present the discovery of a third WD pulsar, SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8. The optical spectrum is dominated by molecular bands from an M-dwarf companion, with additional narrow emission lines from the Balmer series and He I. The long-term optical light-curve folded on its orbital period ($P_\mathrm{orb} = 3.49$ h) exhibits large scatter (roughly 10 per cent). High-cadence photometry reveals a short period signal, which we interpret to be the spin period of the WD primary ($P_\mathrm{spin} \simeq 92$ s). The WD spin period is slightly shorter than that of AR Sco ($\rm \sim 117$ s), the WD pulsar prototype. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals emission from the irradiated companion and Na I absorption lines approximately tracing its centre of mass, which yields a binary mass function of $f(M) \simeq 0.2 {\rm M_\odot}$. The H$\alpha$ emission includes a low-amplitude broad component, resembling the energetic emission line flashes seen in AR Sco. Using spectral templates, we classify the companion to be most likely a $\rm M4.0\pm 0.5$ star with $T_\mathrm{\rm eff} \approx 3300$ K. Modelling the stellar contribution constrains the secondary mass ($0.19\,{\rm M_\odot}\lesssim M_2\lesssim 0.28\,{\rm M_\odot}$), system distance ($\simeq1.25\,{\rm kpc}$), and inclination ($i \simeq 45-50^\circ$). We discuss the proposed evolutionary scenarios and summarize the observational properties of all three known WD pulsars, establishing a benchmark for identifying and classifying future members of this emerging class.</description>

      <title>A direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$ and implications for the emission size of the magnetar XTE J1810-197</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$, enabled by 550-750~MHz baseband observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized medium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission from a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference between the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as scintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth \nud=$149\pm3$~Hz as well as a scatter-broadening timescale \taud=$1.22\pm0.09$~ms at 650~MHz. These two quantities are related through the uncertainty relation $C_1 = 2\pi$\nud\taud, using which we directly measure $C_1=1.2\pm0.1$. We describe the methods employed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as well as for the magnetar XTE~J1810\textminus197, towards which the measurements have been made. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of $C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index and hence quantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios in the ionized medium. Finally, using the fact $C_1 \sim 1$, we nominally constrain the emission size to less than a few 1000~km for a screen very close to the magnetar, and to within the magnetosphere for all screen distances.</description>

      <title>Prompt and Conventional High-Energy Muon Spectra from a full Monte Carlo Simulation via $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive air showers produce high-energy muons that can be utilized to probe hadronic interaction models in cosmic ray interactions. Most muons originate from pion and kaon decays, called $\textit{conventional}$ muons, while a smaller fraction, referred to as $\textit{prompt}$ muons, arises from the decay of heavier, short-lived hadrons. The $\texttt{EHISTORY}$ option of the air shower simulation tool $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ is used in this work to investigate the prompt and conventional muon flux in the energy range of 100 TeV to 100 PeV, utilizing the newly developed open-source python software $\texttt{PANAMA}$. Identifying the muon parent particles allows for scaling the contribution of prompt particles, which can be leveraged by future experimental analyses to measure the normalization of the prompt muon flux. Obtained prompt muon spectra from $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ are compared to $\texttt{MCEq}$ results. The relevance to large-volume neutrino detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, and the connection to hadronic interaction models is discussed.</description>

      <title>A new independent look at the galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binary distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigations of the Galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs) offer valuable insights into the elusive black hole population in the Milky Way. Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and BH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the Galactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an X-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We perform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present in our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection effects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction factor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely follows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a bias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that clearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close to the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a true paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the simulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low Galactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and find that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with some BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin disc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their birth place.</description>

Abstract: Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now well established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. HESS, located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited in terms of field of view and energy reach.
  SWGO is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.</description>

      <title>Convection Anisotropies of Cosmic Rays in Highly Magnetized Plasma</title>

Abstract: Recently, Zhang &amp; Liu (2024) proposed a turbulent convection model for multiscale anisotropies of cosmic rays (CRs), with an assumption of isotropic diffusion such that the anisotropies are statistically isotropic. However, this assumption may be unrealistic for TeV CRs, whose observations have revealed the significance of the local interstellar background magnetic field. To meet the difficulty, the turbulent convection scenario needs to be extended to cover anisotropic diffusion. In this paper, we focus on the parallel diffusion with isotropic pitch-angle scattering, which may be an approximation to the transport process driven by weak hydromagnetic waves in a magnetic flux tube, where fluctuations of the wave velocities lead to the turbulent convection. The consequence is the breaking of the statistical isotropy, while the overall shape of the angular power spectrum, $ \overline{C_\ell}\propto\ell ^{-\gamma -1} $ ($ \ell\gg 1 $), remains similar to that in the isotropic diffusion model, where $ \ell $ are degrees of spherical harmonics, and $ \gamma $ is the turbulence spectral index of the convection field. It is then expected that the power-law index of the TeV CR small-scale angular power spectrum can be explained with the Kolmogorov law $ \gamma =5/3 $, irrespective of the background magnetic field to some extent.</description>

      <title>A gas-rich cosmic web revealed by the partitioning of the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse ($&lt;$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction $&lt;$10$^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. This diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b\,h_{70} = 0.051_{-0.006}^{+0.006}$. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can deplete galaxy halos and enrich the IGM ($f_{\rm IGM}=0.76_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$), agreeing with the baryon-rich cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. Our results may reduce the ``$S_8$ tension'' in cosmology, as strong feedback leads to suppression of the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Interactions among binary black holes in star clusters: Eccentric gravitational wave captures and triple formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is only a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the theoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically formed - or, commonly referred to as three-body - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent suggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were neglected in the theory. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo models to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate using post-Newtonian equations of motion up to 3.5PN. We explore the nature of the BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the various outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated eccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH triple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the ZLK mechanism. We find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed three-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH interactions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for the finding of a single dynamically active BBH in N-body models. An important implication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are independent of uncertain initial binary properties. With the use of a population synthesis model for BBH-BBH interactions in globular clusters, we obtain a local rate of GW captures of $R=1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ as well as their eccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH interaction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We also confirm that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions can merge via ZLK oscillations, although their merger rate is lower than GW captures. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals from eccentric BBHs</description>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and serves as the cornerstone of modern physics, supporting the constancy of the speed of light. A crucial implication of this principle is that no particle can propagate faster than this universal speed limit. In this study, we present a stringent neutrino-based test of Lorentz invariance, utilizing the highest-energy neutrino ever detected, known as event KM3-230213A. The detection of this neutrino, with measured energy of approximately 220 PeV, allows us to establish a lower bound on the scale of second-order Lorentz invariance violation, quantified as \(\Lambda_2&gt;5.0\times 10^{19}\) GeV at 90 \% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes in dwarf galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>One Membrane to Love them all: Tidal deformations of compact objects from the membrane paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal deformability is a key observable to test the nature of compact objects in a binary coalescence. Within vacuum General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of a four-dimensional black hole are strictly zero, while they are non-zero and model-dependent for material objects, matter distributions around black holes, or in alternative theories of gravity. Here, we develop a model-agnostic framework based on the membrane paradigm, where the tidal properties of a spherically symmetric object are encoded in the response of a fictitious membrane in terms of viscosity coefficients. We show that both neutron stars and exotic compact objects (in particular, we provide an explicit example for thin-shell gravastars) are included in this framework, provided that the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients of the membrane have a nontrivial frequency dependence. We derive a general result for the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers for non-rotating and spherically symmetric compact objects in terms of the viscosity coefficients, discussing their behavior with the compactness of the object, and identifying the conditions for the logarithmic behavior found in previous literature for various ultracompact objects. Finally, we show that the membrane shear viscosity coefficients associated with neutron star models feature novel quasi-universal relations, which depend only mildly on the neutron-star equation of state.</description>
