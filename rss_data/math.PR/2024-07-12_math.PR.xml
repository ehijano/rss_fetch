      <title>The Game of Band or Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report we generalize the game of Book or Band described in Levin (2024) to an arbitrary playing deck with $m$ ranks and $s$ cards in each rank, for a total of $t=ms$ cards. Two events (a band or a bump) are defined in terms of given non-negative integers $0\le l\le u \le s$, not necessarily with $l+u=s$. We derive expressions for the joint stopping time distribution and outcome band or bump in terms of rectangular event probabilities for central multiple hyper-geometric random variables.</description>

      <title>A Markovian characterization of the exponential twist of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the exponential twist, i.e. a path-integral exponential change of measure, of a Markovian reference probability measure $\P$. This type of transformation naturally appears in variational representation formulae originating from the theory of large deviations and can be interpreted in some cases, as the solution of a specific stochastic control problem. Under a very general Markovian assumption on $\P$, we fully characterize the exponential twist probability measure as the solution of a martingale problem and prove that it inherits the Markov property of the reference measure. The ''generator'' of the martingale problem shows  a drift depending on a ''generalized gradient'' of some  suitable ''value function'' $v$.</description>

      <title>Graph Expansions of Deep Neural Networks and their Universal Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</description>

      <title>Killing versus catastrophes in birth-death processes and an application to population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish connections between the absorption probabilities of a class of birth-death processes with killing, and the stationary tail distributions of a related class of birth-death processes with catastrophes. Major ingredients of the proofs are an excursion decomposition of sample paths, a generalised detailed-balance condition, and representations of our processes in terms of superpositions of simpler processes. An overarching role is played by Siegmund duality, which allows us to invert the relationship between the processes.
  We apply our results to a pair of ancestral processes in population genetics, namely the killed ancestral selection graph and the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph, in a finite population setting and its diffusion limit.</description>

      <title>Lower tail large deviations of the stochastic six vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study lower tail probabilities of the height function $\mathfrak{h}(M,N)$ of the stochastic six-vertex model. We introduce a novel combinatorial approach to demonstrate that the tail probabilities $\mathbb{P}(\mathfrak{h}(M,N) \ge r)$ are log-concave in a certain weak sense. We prove further that for each $\alpha&gt;0$ the lower tail of $-\mathfrak{h}(\lfloor \alpha N \rfloor, N)$ satisfies a Large Deviation Principle (LDP) with speed $N^2$ and a rate function $\Phi_\alpha^{(-)}$, which is given by the infimal deconvolution between a certain energy integral and a parabola.
  Our analysis begins with a distributional identity from BO17 [arXiv:1608.01564], which relates the lower tail of the height function, after a random shift, with a multiplicative functional of the Schur measure. Tools from potential theory allow us to extract the LDP for the shifted height function. We then use our weak log-concavity result, along with a deconvolution scheme from our earlier paper [arXiv:2307.01179], to convert the LDP for the shifted height function to the LDP for the stochastic six-vertex model height function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two-sided bounds on the expected values of several geometric functionals of the convex hull of Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their inverse processes. This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017), Jovaleki\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \^{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from the plane to higher dimensions. All of our bounds capture the correct order of asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of Adam and other adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimization methods for non-vanishing learning rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms - typically consisting of a class of deep neural networks trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays the key ingredients in many artificial intelligence (AI) systems and have revolutionized our ways of working and living in modern societies. For example, SGD methods are used to train powerful large language models (LLMs) such as versions of ChatGPT and Gemini, SGD methods are employed to create successful generative AI based text-to-image creation models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion, but SGD methods are also used to train DNNs to approximately solve scientific models such as partial differential equation (PDE) models from physics and biology and optimal control and stopping problems from engineering. It is known that the plain vanilla standard SGD method fails to converge even in the situation of several convex optimization problems if the learning rates are bounded away from zero. However, in many practical relevant training scenarios, often not the plain vanilla standard SGD method but instead adaptive SGD methods such as the RMSprop and the Adam optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, are employed. This naturally rises the question whether such adaptive optimizers, in which the learning rates are modified adaptively during the training process, do converge in the situation of non-vanishing learning rates. In this work we answer this question negatively by proving that adaptive SGD methods such as the popular Adam optimizer fail to converge to any possible random limit point if the learning rates are asymptotically bounded away from zero. In our proof of this non-convergence result we establish suitable pathwise a priori bounds for a class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods, which are also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Conformal field theory of Gaussian free fields in a multiply connected domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a version of conformal field theory (CFT) that gives a connection to SLE in a multiply connected domain. Our approach is based on the Gaussian free field and applies to CFTs with central charge $c \leq 1$. In this framework we introduce the generalized Eguchi-Ooguri equations and use them to derive the explicit form of Ward's equations, which describe the insertion of a stress tensor in terms of Lie derivatives and differential operators depending on the Teicm\"{u}ller modular parameters. Furthermore, by implementing the BPZ equations, we provide a conformal field theoretic realization of an SLE in a multiply connected domain, which in particular suggests its drift function, and construct a class of martingale observables for this SLE process.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorems for expanding maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove local central limit theorems for partial sums of the form \newline $\,S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j\circ T_{j-1}\circ\cdots\circ T_1\circ T_0$ where $f_j$ are uniformly H\"older functions and $T_j$ are expanding maps. Using a symbolic representation a similar result follows for maps $T_j$ in a small $C^1$ neighborhood of an Axiom A map and H\"older continuous functions $f_j$. All of our results are already new when all maps are the same $T_j=T$ but observables $(f_j)$ are different. The current paper compliments [43] where Berry--Esseen theorems are obtained. An important step in the proof is developing an appropriate reduction theory in the sequential case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how one can view certain models in regularity structures as some form of geometric rough paths. This is performed by identifying the deformed Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra with a quotient of the shuffle Hopf algebra which is the structure underlying the definition of a geometric rough path. This provides an extension of the isomorphism between the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and the shuffle Hopf algebra. This new algebraic result relies strongly on the deformation formalism and the post-Lie structures introduced recently in the context of regularity structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a version of the classical Ehrenfest urn model with two urns and two types of balls: regular and heavy. Each ball is selected independently according to a Poisson process having rate $1$ for regular balls and rate $\alpha\in(0,1)$ for heavy balls, and once a ball is selected, is placed in a urn uniformly at random. We study the asymptotic behavior when the total number of balls, $N$, goes to infinity, and the number of heavy ball is set to $m_N\in\{1,\dots, N-1\}$. We focus on the observable given by the total number of balls in the left urn, which converges to a binomial distribution of parameter $1/2$, regardless of the choice of the two parameters, $\alpha$ and $m_N$. We study the speed of convergence and show that this can exhibit three different phenomenologies depending on the choice of the two parameters of the model.</description>

Abstract: We extend the central limit theorem under the Dedecker-Rio condition to adapted stationary and ergodic sequences of random variables taking values in a class of smooth Banach spaces. This result applies to the case of random variables taking values in $L^p(\mu)$, with $2 \leq p &lt; \infty$ and $\mu$ a $\sigma$-finite real measure. As an application we give a sufficient condition for empirical processes indexed by Sobolev balls to satisfy the central limit theorem, and discuss about the optimality of these conditions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{B}(t)=(B_1(t), B_2(t))$, $t\geq 0$ be a two-dimensional Brownian motion with independent components and define the $\mathbf{\gamma}$-reflected process $$\mathbf{X}(t)=(X_1(t),X_2(t))=\left(B_1(t)-c_1t-\gamma_1\inf_{s_1\in[0,t]}(B_1(s_1)-c_1s_1),B_2(t)-c_2t-\gamma_2\inf_{s_2\in[0,t]}(B_2(s_2)-c_2s_2)\right),$$ with given finite constants $c_1,c_2,\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_1,\gamma_2\in[0,1]$. The goal of this paper is to derive the asymptotics of ruin probability $$\mathbb{P}\{\exists_{t\in[0,T]}: X_1(t)&gt;u,X_2(t)&gt;au\}$$ as $u\to\infty$ for $a\leq 1$ and $T&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term. Under a condition on the Besov regularity of the reaction term, it was proven recently that a strong solution exists and is unique in the pathwise sense, in a class of H\"older continuous processes. For a suitable choice of sequence $(b^k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ approximating $b$, we prove that the error between the solution $u$ of the SPDE with reaction term $b$ and its tamed Euler finite-difference scheme with mollified drift $b^k$, converges to $0$ in $L^m(\Omega)$ with a rate that depends on the Besov regularity of $b$. In particular, one can consider two interesting cases: first, even when $b$ is only a (finite) measure, a rate of convergence is obtained. On the other hand, when $b$ is a bounded measurable function, the (almost) optimal rate of convergence $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$-in space and $(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon)$-in time is achieved. Stochastic sewing techniques are used in the proofs, in particular to deduce new regularising properties of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

Abstract: We consider an $M/G/\infty$ queue with infinite expected service time. We then provide the transience/recurrence classification of the states (the system is said to be at state $n$ if there are $n$ customers being served), observing also that here (unlike e.g. irreducible Markov chains) it is possible for recurrent and transient states to coexist. We also prove a lower bound on the growth speed in the transient case.</description>

Abstract: This paper formalizes connections between stability of polynomials and convergence rates of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We prove that if a (multivariate) partition function is nonzero in a region around a real point $\lambda$ then spectral independence holds at $\lambda$. As a consequence, for Holant-type problems (e.g., spin systems) on bounded-degree graphs, we obtain optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing time bounds for the single-site update Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics. Our result significantly improves the running time guarantees obtained via the polynomial interpolation method of Barvinok (2017), refined by Patel and Regts (2017).
  There are a variety of applications of our results. In this paper, we focus on Holant-type (i.e., edge-coloring) problems, including weighted edge covers and weighted even subgraphs. For the weighted edge cover problem (and several natural generalizations) we obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm on bounded-degree graphs. The even subgraphs problem corresponds to the high-temperature expansion of the ferromagnetic Ising model. We obtain an $O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Ising model with a nonzero external field on bounded-degree graphs, which improves upon the classical result of Jerrum and Sinclair (1993) for this class of graphs. We obtain further applications to antiferromagnetic two-spin models on line graphs, weighted graph homomorphisms, tensor networks, and more.</description>

      <title>The Poisson boundary of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products $A\wr B= \bigoplus_{B} A\rtimes B$ of countable groups $A$ and $B$, for probability measures $\mu$ with finite entropy where lamp configurations stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of $\mu$ to $B$ is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of $(A\wr B,\mu)$ is equal to the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and Lyons-Peres, for $B=\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, and measures $\mu$ with a finite first moment.</description>

      <title>Hille's theorem for Bochner integrals of functions with values in locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hille's theorem is a powerful classical result in vector measure theory. It asserts that the application of a closed, unbounded linear operator commutes with strong/Bochner integration of functions taking values in a Banach space. This note shows that Hille's theorem also holds in the setting of complete locally convex spaces.</description>

      <title>Siegmund duality for physicists: a bridge between spatial and first-passage properties of continuous and discrete time stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one-dimensional stochastic process $x(t)$, or a random walk $X_n$, which describes the position of a particle evolving inside an interval $[a,b]$, with absorbing walls located at $a$ and $b$. In continuous time, $x(t)$ is driven by some equilibrium process $\mathbf{\theta}(t)$, while in discrete time, the jumps of $X_n$ follow a stationary process that obeys a time reversal property. An important observable to characterize its behaviour is the exit probability $E_b(x,t)$, which is the probability for the particle to be absorbed first at the wall $b$, before or at time $t$, given its initial position $x$. In this paper we show that the derivation of this quantity can be tackled by studying a dual process $y(t)$ very similar to $x(t)$ but with hard walls at $a$ and $b$. More precisely, we show that the quantity $E_b(x,t)$ for the process $x(t)$ is equal to the probability $\tilde \Phi(x,t|b)$ of finding the dual process inside the interval $[a,x]$ at time $t$, with $y(0) =b$. This is known as Siegmund duality in mathematics. Here we show that this duality applies to various processes which are of interest in physics, including models of active particles, diffusing diffusivity models, a large class of discrete and continuous time random walks, and even processes subjected to stochastic resetting. For all these cases, we provide an explicit construction of the dual process. We also give simple derivations of this identity both in the continuous and in the discrete time setting, as well as numerical tests for a large number of models of interest. Finally, we use simulations to show that the duality is also likely to hold for more complex processes such as fractional Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>A model for slowing particles in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>

      <title>New algorithms for sampling and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing from the theory of stochastic differential equations, we introduce a novel sampling method for known distributions and a new algorithm for diffusion generative models with unknown distributions. Our approach is inspired by the concept of the reverse diffusion process, widely adopted in diffusion generative models. Additionally, we derive the explicit convergence rate based on the smooth ODE flow. For diffusion generative models and sampling, we establish a dimension-free particle approximation convergence result. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, unlike the traditional Langevin method, our sampling method does not require any regularity assumptions about the density function of the target distribution. Furthermore, we also apply our method to optimization problems.</description>
