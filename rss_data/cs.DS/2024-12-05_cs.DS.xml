      <title>Computing the Center of Uncertain Points on Cactus Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the (weighted) one-center problem of uncertain points on a cactus graph. Given are a cactus graph $G$ and a set of $n$ uncertain points. Each uncertain point has $m$ possible locations on $G$ with probabilities and a non-negative weight. The (weighted) one-center problem aims to compute a point (the center) $x^*$ on $G$ to minimize the maximum (weighted) expected distance from $x^*$ to all uncertain points. No previous algorithm is known for this problem. In this paper, we propose an $O(|G| + mn\log mn)$-time algorithm for solving it. Since the input is $O(|G|+mn)$, our algorithm is almost optimal.</description>

      <title>Improved Differentially Private Continual Observation Using Group Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private weighted prefix sum under continual observation is a crucial component in the production-level deployment of private next-word prediction for Gboard, which, according to Google, has over a billion users. More specifically, Google uses a differentially private mechanism to sum weighted gradients in its \emph{private follow-the-regularized leader} algorithm. Apart from efficiency, the additive error of the private mechanism is crucial as multiplied with the square root of the model's dimension $d$ (with $d$ ranging up to $10$ trillion, for example, Switch Transformers or M6-10T), it determines the accuracy of the learning system. So, any improvement in leading constant matters significantly in practice.
  In this paper, we show a novel connection between mechanisms for continual weighted prefix sum and a concept in representation theory known as the group matrix introduced in correspondence between Dedekind and Frobenius (1897) and generalized by Schur (1904). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of group algebra to analyze differentially private algorithms. Using this connection, we analyze a class of matrix norms known as {\em factorization norms} that give upper and lower bounds for the additive error under general $\ell_p$-norms of the matrix mechanism. This allows us to give the first efficient factorization that matches the best-known non-constructive upper bound on the factorization norm by Mathias (1993) for the matrix used in Google's deployment and also improves on the previous best-known constructive bound of Fichtenberger et al. (ICML 2023) and Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023) and the first upper bound on the additive error for a large class of weight functions for weighted prefix sum problems, including the sliding window matrix (Bolot et al. (ICDT 2013).</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds on a tree inference algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tightens the best known analysis of Hein's 1989 algorithm to infer the topology of a weighted tree based on the lengths of paths between its leaves. It shows that the number of length queries required for a degree-$k$ tree of $n$ leaves is $O(n k \log_k n)$, which is the lower bound. It also presents a family of trees for which the performance is asymptotically better, and shows that no such family exists for a competing $O(n k \log_k n)$ algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Consistent $k$-Center Clustering with Optimal Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given points from an arbitrary metric space and a sequence of point updates sent by an adversary, what is the minimum recourse per update (i.e., the minimum number of changes needed to the set of centers after an update), in order to maintain a constant-factor approximation to a $k$-clustering problem? This question has received attention in recent years under the name consistent clustering.
  Previous works by Lattanzi and Vassilvitskii [ICLM '17] and Fichtenberger, Lattanzi, Norouzi-Fard, and Svensson [SODA '21] studied $k$-clustering objectives, including the $k$-center and the $k$-median objectives, under only point insertions. In this paper we study the $k$-center objective in the fully dynamic setting, where the update is either a point insertion or a point deletion. Before our work, {\L}\k{a}cki, Haeupler, Grunau, Rozho\v{n}, and Jayaram [SODA '24] gave a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm for the $k$-center objective with worst-case recourse of $2$ per update.
  In this work, we prove that the $k$-center clustering problem admits optimal recourse bounds by developing a deterministic fully dynamic constant-factor approximation algorithm with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Moreover our algorithm performs simple choices based on light data structures, and thus is arguably more direct and faster than the previous one which uses a sophisticated combinatorial structure. Additionally, we develop a new deterministic decremental algorithm and a new deterministic incremental algorithm, both of which maintain a $6$-approximate $k$-center solution with worst-case recourse of $1$ per update. Our incremental algorithm improves over the $8$-approximation algorithm by Charikar, Chekuri, Feder, and Motwani [STOC '97]. Finally, we remark that since all three of our algorithms are deterministic, they work against an adaptive adversary.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of $\ell_2^2$ Min-Sum Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem is to partition an input set into clusters $C_1,\ldots,C_k$ to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{p,q\in C_i}\|p-q\|_2^2$. Although $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering is NP-hard, it is not known whether it is NP-hard to approximate $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering beyond a certain factor.
  In this paper, we give the first hardness-of-approximation result for the $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering problem. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than $1.056$ and moreover, assuming a balanced variant of the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, it is NP-hard to approximate the objective to a factor better than 1.327.
  We then complement our hardness result by giving the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-coreset construction for $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering. Our coreset uses $\mathcal{O}\left(k^{\varepsilon^{-4}}\right)$ space and can be leveraged to achieve a polynomial-time approximation scheme with runtime $nd\cdot f(k,\varepsilon^{-1})$, where $d$ is the underlying dimension of the input dataset and $f$ is a fixed function.
  Finally, we consider a learning-augmented setting, where the algorithm has access to an oracle that outputs a label $i\in[k]$ for input point, thereby implicitly partitioning the input dataset into $k$ clusters that induce an approximately optimal solution, up to some amount of adversarial error $\alpha\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a $\frac{1+\gamma\alpha}{(1-\alpha)^2}$-approximation to $\ell_2^2$ min-sum $k$-clustering, for a fixed constant $\gamma&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general method to convert a "primal" black-box algorithm for solving regularized convex-concave minimax optimization problems into an algorithm for solving the associated dual maximin optimization problem. Our method adds recursive regularization over a logarithmic number of rounds where each round consists of an approximate regularized primal optimization followed by the computation of a dual best response. We apply this result to obtain new state-of-the-art runtimes for solving matrix games in specific parameter regimes, obtain improved query complexity for solving the dual of the CVaR distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, and recover the optimal query complexity for finding a stationary point of a convex function.</description>

      <title>Theoretical limitations of multi-layer Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, especially the decoder-only variants, are the backbone of most modern large language models; yet we do not have much understanding of their expressive power except for the simple $1$-layer case.
  Due to the difficulty of analyzing multi-layer models, all previous work relies on unproven complexity conjectures to show limitations for multi-layer Transformers. In this work, we prove the first $\textit{unconditional}$ lower bound against multi-layer decoder-only transformers. For any constant $L$, we prove that any $L$-layer decoder-only transformer needs a polynomial model dimension ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) to perform sequential composition of $L$ functions over an input of $n$ tokens.
  As a consequence, our results give: (1) the first depth-width trade-off for multi-layer transformers, exhibiting that the $L$-step composition task is exponentially harder for $L$-layer models compared to $(L+1)$-layer ones; (2) an unconditional separation between encoder and decoder, exhibiting a hard task for decoders that can be solved by an exponentially shallower and smaller encoder; (3) a provable advantage of chain-of-thought, exhibiting a task that becomes exponentially easier with chain-of-thought.
  On the technical side, we propose the multi-party $\textit{autoregressive}$ $\textit{communication}$ $\textit{model}$ that captures the computation of a decoder-only Transformer. We also introduce a new proof technique that finds a certain $\textit{indistinguishable}$ $\textit{decomposition}$ of all possible inputs iteratively for proving lower bounds in this model. We believe our new communication model and proof technique will be helpful to further understand the computational power of transformers.</description>

      <title>Provably Extending PageRank-based Local Clustering Algorithm to Weighted Directed Graphs with Self-Loops and to Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local clustering aims to find a compact cluster near the given starting instances. This work focuses on graph local clustering, which has broad applications beyond graphs because of the internal connectivities within various modalities. While most existing studies on local graph clustering adopt the discrete graph setting (i.e., unweighted graphs without self-loops), real-world graphs can be more complex. In this paper, we extend the non-approximating Andersen-Chung-Lang ("ACL") algorithm beyond discrete graphs and generalize its quadratic optimality to a wider range of graphs, including weighted, directed, and self-looped graphs and hypergraphs. Specifically, leveraging PageRank, we propose two algorithms: GeneralACL for graphs and HyperACL for hypergraphs. We theoretically prove that, under two mild conditions, both algorithms can identify a quadratically optimal local cluster in terms of conductance with at least 1/2 probability. On the property of hypergraphs, we address a fundamental gap in the literature by defining conductance for hypergraphs from the perspective of hypergraph random walks. Additionally, we provide experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Entropy Regularization and Faster Decremental Matching in General Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm that maintains, against an adaptive adversary, a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum matching in $n$-node $m$-edge general (not necessarily bipartite) undirected graph undergoing edge deletions with high probability with (amortized) $O(\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}, \log n))$ time per update. We also obtain the same update time for maintaining a fractional approximate weighted matching (and hence an approximation to the value of the maximum weight matching) and an integral approximate weighted matching in dense graphs. Our unweighted result improves upon the prior state-of-the-art which includes a $\mathrm{poly}(\log{n}) \cdot 2^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ update time [Assadi-Bernstein-Dudeja 2022] and an $O(\sqrt{m} \varepsilon^{-2})$ update time [Gupta-Peng 2013], and our weighted result improves upon the $O(\sqrt{m}\varepsilon^{-O(1/\varepsilon)}\log{n})$ update time due to [Gupta-Peng 2013].
  To obtain our results, we generalize a recent optimization approach to dynamic algorithms from [Jambulapati-Jin-Sidford-Tian 2022]. We show that repeatedly solving entropy-regularized optimization problems yields a lazy updating scheme for fractional decremental problems with a near-optimal number of updates. To apply this framework we develop optimization methods compatible with it and new dynamic rounding algorithms for the matching polytope.</description>

      <title>Tree-Packing Revisited: Faster Fully Dynamic Min-Cut and Arboricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tree-packing is a collection of spanning trees of a graph. It has been a useful tool for computing the minimum cut in static, dynamic, and distributed settings. In particular, [Thorup, Comb. 2007] used them to obtain his dynamic min-cut algorithm with $\tilde O(\lambda^{14.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time. We reexamine this relationship, showing that we need to maintain fewer spanning trees for such a result; we show that we only need to pack $\Theta(\lambda^3 \log m)$ greedy trees to guarantee a 1-respecting cut or a trivial cut in some contracted graph.
  Based on this structural result, we then provide a deterministic algorithm for fully dynamic exact min-cut, that has $\tilde O(\lambda^{5.5}\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time, for min-cut value bounded by $\lambda$. In particular, this also leads to an algorithm for general fully dynamic exact min-cut with $\tilde O(m^{1-1/12})$ amortized update time, improving upon $\tilde O(m^{1-1/31})$ [Goranci et al., SODA 2023].
  We also give the first fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the fractional arboricity -- which is strictly harder than the integral arboricity. Our algorithm is deterministic and has $O(\alpha \log^6m/\varepsilon^4)$ amortized update time, for arboricity at most $\alpha$. We extend these results to a Monte Carlo algorithm with $O(\text{poly}(\log m,\varepsilon^{-1}))$ amortized update time against an adaptive adversary. Our algorithms work on multi-graphs as well.
  Both result are obtained by exploring the connection between the min-cut/arboricity and (greedy) tree-packing. We investigate tree-packing in a broader sense; including a lower bound for greedy tree-packing, which - to the best of our knowledge - is the first progress on this topic since [Thorup, Comb. 2007].</description>

      <title>Improved Spectral Density Estimation via Explicit and Implicit Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithms for approximating the spectral density of a symmetric matrix $A$ that is accessed through matrix-vector product queries. By combining a previously studied Chebyshev polynomial moment matching method with a deflation step that approximately projects off the largest magnitude eigendirections of $A$ before estimating the spectral density, we give an $\epsilon\cdot\sigma_\ell(A)$ error approximation to the spectral density in the Wasserstein-$1$ metric using $O(\ell\log n+ 1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products, where $\sigma_\ell(A)$ is the $\ell^{th}$ largest singular value of $A$. In the common case when $A$ exhibits fast singular value decay, our bound can be much stronger than prior work, which gives an error bound of $\epsilon \cdot ||A||_2$ using $O(1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products. We also show that it is nearly tight: any algorithm giving error $\epsilon \cdot \sigma_\ell(A)$ must use $\Omega(\ell+1/\epsilon)$ matrix-vector products.
  We further show that the popular Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) method matches the above bound, even though SLQ itself is parameter-free and performs no explicit deflation. This bound explains the strong practical performance of SLQ, and motivates a simple variant of SLQ that achieves an even tighter error bound. Our error bound for SLQ leverages an analysis that views it as an implicit polynomial moment matching method, along with recent results on low-rank approximation with single-vector Krylov methods. We use these results to show that the method can perform implicit deflation as part of moment matching.</description>

      <title>Online versus Offline Adversaries in Property Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study property testing with incomplete or noisy inputs. The models we consider allow for adversarial manipulation of the input, but differ in whether the manipulation can be done only offline, i.e., before the execution of the algorithm, or online, i.e., as the algorithm runs. The manipulations by an adversary can come in the form of erasures or corruptions. We compare the query complexity and the randomness complexity of property testing in the offline and online models. Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, and Varma (Theory Comput `23) provide properties that can be tested with a small number of queries with offline erasures, but cannot be tested at all with online erasures. We demonstrate that the two models are incomparable in terms of query complexity: we construct properties that can be tested with a constant number of queries in the online corruption model, but require querying a significant fraction of the input in the offline erasure model. We also construct properties that exhibit a strong separation between the randomness complexity of testing in the presence of offline and online adversaries: testing these properties in the online model requires exponentially more random bits than in the offline model, even when they are tested with nearly the same number of queries in both models. Our randomness separation relies on a novel reduction from randomness-efficient testers in the adversarial online model to query-efficient testers in the standard model.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Pen Testing (or Consumer Surplus of Deferred-Acceptance Auctions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pen testing is the problem of selecting high-capacity resources when the only way to measure the capacity of a resource expends its capacity. We have a set of $n$ pens with unknown amounts of ink and our goal is to select a feasible subset of pens maximizing the total ink in them. We are allowed to learn about the ink levels by writing with them, but this uses up ink that was previously in the pens.
  We identify optimal and near optimal pen testing algorithms by drawing analogues to auction theoretic frameworks of deferred-acceptance auctions and virtual values. Our framework allows the conversion of any near optimal deferred-acceptance mechanism into a near optimal pen testing algorithm. Moreover, these algorithms guarantee an additional overhead of at most $(1+o(1)) \ln n$ in the approximation factor to the omniscient algorithm that has access to the ink levels in the pens. We use this framework to give pen testing algorithms for various combinatorial constraints like matroid, knapsack, and general downward-closed constraints, and also for online environments.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{resolving set} $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic points of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs, \emph{i.e.}, graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the \emph{temporal distance from $u$ to $v$} is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, \emph{i.e.}, the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A \emph{temporal resolving set} of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step~1 or~2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for $k$-NN Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a fast computation method for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$-NN) regression. We show that, under a tie-breaking condition for nearest neighbours, the LOOCV estimate of the mean square error for $k$-NN regression is identical to the mean square error of $(k+1)$-NN regression evaluated on the training data, multiplied by the scaling factor $(k+1)^2/k^2$. Therefore, to compute the LOOCV score, one only needs to fit $(k+1)$-NN regression only once, and does not need to repeat training-validation of $k$-NN regression for the number of training data. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the fast computation method.</description>

      <title>Directed Hypercube Routing, a Generalized Lehman-Ron Theorem, and Monotonicity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to monotonicity testing, Lehman and Ron (JCTA, 2001) proved the existence of a collection of vertex disjoint paths between comparable sub-level sets in the directed hypercube. The main technical contribution of this paper is a new proof method that yields a generalization to their theorem: we prove the existence of two edge-disjoint collections of vertex disjoint paths. Our main conceptual contribution are conjectures on directed hypercube flows with simultaneous vertex and edge capacities of which our generalized Lehman-Ron theorem is a special case. We show that these conjectures imply directed isoperimetric theorems, and in particular, the robust directed Talagrand inequality due to Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SIAM J. on Comp, 2018). These isoperimetric inequalities, that relate the directed surface area (of a set in the hypercube) to its distance to monotonicity, have been crucial in obtaining the best monotonicity testers for Boolean functions. We believe our conjectures pave the way towards combinatorial proofs of these directed isoperimetry theorems.</description>

      <title>Representation of Classical Data on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is currently gaining significant attention, not only from the academic community but also from industry, due to its potential applications across several fields for addressing complex problems. For any practical problem which may be tackled using quantum computing, it is imperative to represent the data used onto a quantum computing system. Depending on the application, many different types of data and data structures occur, including regular numbers, higher-dimensional data structures, e.g., n-dimensional images, up to graphs. This report aims to provide an overview of existing methods for representing these data types on gate-based quantum computers.</description>
