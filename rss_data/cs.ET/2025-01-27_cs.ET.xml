      <title>Dual Dielectric Metasurface for Simultaneous Sensing and Reconfigurable Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dual-functional hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) for simultaneous sensing and reconfigurable reflections. We design a novel hybrid unit cell featuring dual elements, which share the same phase center, to support both intended functionalities, with the antenna being miniaturized via a high dielectric material approach. The hybrid unit cell has a size of one eighth of the wavelength forming the foundation of an innovative metasurface that incorporates a sub-wavelength reflecting array of split-ring unit cells integrated with a load-tuning matrix. In particular, two interleaved sensing arrays of half-wavelength spacing, orthogonal polarization, and quarter-wavelength offset are embedded within the proposed dual-functional RIS, each tasked to sense the channel parameters towards one of the end communication nodes wishing to profit from the surface's reconfigurable reflections. Our full-wave simulations, indicatively centered around the frequency of $5.5$ GHz, showcase the promising performance of both designed hybrid unit cells and reflective split-ring ones.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Ride-Pooling with Public Transit using Reward-Guided Conservative Q-Learning: An Offline Training and Online Fine-Tuning Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, termed Reward-Guided Conservative Q-learning (RG-CQL), to enhance coordination between ride-pooling and public transit within a multimodal transportation network. We model each ride-pooling vehicle as an agent governed by a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose an offline training and online fine-tuning RL framework to learn the optimal operational decisions of the multimodal transportation systems, including rider-vehicle matching, selection of drop-off locations for passengers, and vehicle routing decisions, with improved data efficiency. During the offline training phase, we develop a Conservative Double Deep Q Network (CDDQN) as the action executor and a supervised learning-based reward estimator, termed the Guider Network, to extract valuable insights into action-reward relationships from data batches. In the online fine-tuning phase, the Guider Network serves as an exploration guide, aiding CDDQN in effectively and conservatively exploring unknown state-action pairs. The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated through a realistic case study using real-world data from Manhattan. We show that integrating ride-pooling with public transit outperforms two benchmark cases solo rides coordinated with transit and ride-pooling without transit coordination by 17% and 22% in the achieved system rewards, respectively. Furthermore, our innovative offline training and online fine-tuning framework offers a remarkable 81.3% improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional online RL methods with adequate exploration budgets, with a 4.3% increase in total rewards and a 5.6% reduction in overestimation errors. Experimental results further demonstrate that RG-CQL effectively addresses the challenges of transitioning from offline to online RL in large-scale ride-pooling systems integrated with transit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization by Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth optimization of a quantum circuit consisting of commuting operations is shown to be reducible to the vertex coloring problem in graph theory. The reduction immediately leads to an algorithm for circuit optimization of commuting gates utilizing any coloring solver. To examine its applicability, known quantum circuits from the literature are optimized.</description>

      <title>A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed in the near future. It enables cache-coherent shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with a variety of storage devices using simple loads and stores. Alongside unleashing unique opportunities for a wide range of applications, CXL introduces new challenges of data management and crash consistency. Alas, CXL lacks an adequate programming model, which makes reasoning about the correctness and expected behaviors of algorithms and systems on top of it nearly impossible.
  In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs running on top of CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for CXL memory accesses and formally define operational semantics on top of that abstraction. We perform initial measurements that provide practical insight into CXL0. We provide a set of general transformations that adapt concurrent algorithms to the new disruptive technology. These transformations enhance linearizable algorithms with durability under a general partial-failure model. We provide an additional transformation for algorithms designed for persistent main memory and full-system crashes. We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and modeling on top of CXL, and support the development of future models as software and hardware evolve.</description>
