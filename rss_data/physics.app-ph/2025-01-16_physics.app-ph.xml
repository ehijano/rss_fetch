      <title>Effect of thickness on the maximum potential drop of current collectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic principle for achieving high-power capability on an electrochemical energy storage cell is minimizing the overall resistance. The resistance due to current collecting systems has not received sufficient attention in the past, presumably because it was not considered of significance for low-power batteries and supercapacitors. However, the necessity of high-power cells has reduced other sources of the inner resistance, and the current collector potential drop has become more important. Moreover, the miniaturization of energy storage devices could increase the ohmic loses in current collectors. In this work, we have developed an electrical model to assess the effect of the current collector thickness on the maximum potential drop. We have found that the thickness of current collectors is a critical parameter that can increase the maximum potential drop drastically. Indeed, the maximum potential drop of current collectors remains almost constant for thicknesses greater than 500 lm, but below this value, there is an inverse relationship between the maximum potential drop and the thickness. We have also analyzed the effect of the material and tab position in the maximum potential drop.</description>

      <title>Spatial Sound Modulation through Manual Reconfiguration of Phased Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic phased array technology, while versatile, often requires complex computing resources and numerous amplifier components. We present a Manually Reconfigurable Phased Array that physically controls transducer position and phase, offering a simpler alternative to traditional phased array transducers (PAT). Our system uses a conductor rod-connected transducer array with an underlying plate that modulates the phase state through its shape and electrode arrangement. This approach enables variable phase reconstruction with reduced computational demands and lower cost. Experimental results demonstrate the device's capability to focus ultrasonic waves at different spatial locations. The system's design facilitates the creation of acoustic fields without extensive digital control, potentially broadening applications in areas such as aerial haptics, audio spotlighting, and educational demonstrations of acoustic phenomena. This work contributes to the development of more accessible and computationally efficient acoustic phased array systems.</description>

      <title>General hybrid asymmetric capacitor model: validation with a commercial lithium ion capacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling and numerical simulations play a vital role in the design and optimization of electrochemical energy storage devices. In this study, a general physics-based model is developed to describe Hybrid Asymmetric Capacitors (HACs). A one-dimensional cell is constructed with one faradaic electrode, a separator and a capacitive electrode. The model is validated using a commercial Lithium Ion Capacitor (LIC). Galvanostatic charge and discharge processes are simulated with a maximum mean relative error of 7.8 %. This suggest that this simple Ohmic model captures the key electrochemical phenomena occurring inside the LIC cell.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical analysis of a full-scale timber-concrete-composite beam from simply supported to frame-connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous TCC (timber-concrete composite) systems have been proposed and studied in recent years. Most of the studies have focused on the behaviour of the timber-concrete shear connection and the flexural behaviour of floor elements. This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study comparing the behaviour of a simply support beam and a beam connected in continuity to mixed TCC supports (a frame-connected beam). Full-scale tests were carried out with 370 mm wide beams and 5.9 m span. Experimental results have shown that the deflection in the frame-connected beam was less than 50% of those observed in the simply supported beam. A three-dimensional finite element model has been validated and calibrated from the test results. This model has been used to evaluate the moment redistribution in the frame-connected beam which, in the case studied, allows the maximum stresses in the timber members to be reduced by up to 49%. Based on the numerical and experimental results, a dimensioning criterion is proposed for the frame-connected beams.</description>

      <title>Chirality transfer from chiral perovskite to molecular dopants via charge transfer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral perovskites are emerging semiconducting materials with broken symmetry that can selectively absorb and emit circularly polarized light. However, most of the chiral perovskites are typically low-dimensional structures with limited electrical conductivity and their light absorption occurs in the UV region. In this work, we find doping 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) in the chiral perovskite matrix can improve the electrical conductivity with an addition of visible light absorption through the emerging charge-transfer electronic states. The new absorption feature exhibits strong circular dichroism adapted from the chiral matrix, which is indicative of a chirality transfer from the host to the guest via an electronic coupling. The charge transfer state is validated by transient absorption spectroscopy and theory modeling. Quantum-chemical modeling identifies a strong wave function overlap between an electron and a hole of the guest-host in a closely packed crystal configuration forming the charge-transfer absorption state. We then integrate the doped chiral perovskite film in photodetectors and demonstrate a selective detection of circularly polarized light both in the UV and visible range. Our results suggest a universal approach of introducing visible photo absorption states to the chiral matrix to broaden the optical active range and enhance the conductivity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking analytical electron ptychography methods for the low-dose imaging of beam-sensitive materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This publication presents an investigation of the performance of different analytical electron ptychography methods for low-dose imaging. In particular, benchmarking is performed for two model-objects, monolayer MoS$_2$ and apoferritin, by means of multislice simulations. Specific attention is given to cases where the individual diffraction patterns remain sparse. After a first rigorous introduction to the theoretical foundations of the methods, an implementation based on the scan-frequency partitioning of calculation steps is described, permitting a significant reduction of memory needs and high sampling flexibility. By analyzing the role of contrast transfer and illumination conditions, this work provides insights into the trade-off between resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and probe focus, as is necessary for the optimization of practical experiments. Furthermore, important differences between the different methods are demonstrated. Overall, the results obtained for the two model-objects demonstrate that analytical ptychography is an attractive option for the low-dose imaging of beam-sensitive materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-Length-Scale Dopants Analysis of an Image Sensor via FIB-SIMS and APT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following letter presents a novel, multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with nanoscale resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Propagation in Water-Sorbing Carbon Xerogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption of water vapor in nanoporous carbons is rather complex due to an interplay between the pore structure and surface chemistry of these materials. Deciphering the mechanism of adsorption requires the knowledge of the spatial distribution and the filling fraction of the adsorbed water. Characteristics of ultrasonic wave propagation through a nanoporous sample provides a wealth of information such as properties of fluids confined in the pores and spatial distribution of adsorbate in the pores. Here we studied water vapor adsorption on carbon xerogel, with a bimodal pore size distribution consisting of micropores (1 nm) and mesopores (8 nm) and overall porosity 68%. The relative humidity was increased in steps and the amount of water adsorbed by the sample was measured gravimetrically at each step, producing a type V isotherm, characteristic of water adsorption to weakly interacting carbon nanopores. Concurrently, we recorded the waveforms for longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic waves that passed through the sample at each saturation step. These measurements provided the wave amplitudes and speeds as a function of relative humidity, and these data were used to calculate the elastic moduli and ultrasonic attenuation of the xerogel-water composite. Analysis of the elastic moduli evolution suggested that confined water shows nearly bulk-like properties in mesopores, while in micropores its modulus noticeably differs from that of bulk water, consistent with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the observed increase in ultrasonic attenuation during micropore filling indicated the spatial heterogeneity of the water-filled pore space within the overall sample volume. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful utilization of nondestructive ultrasonic testing to probe the fluid adsorption mechanism in a nanoporous medium and the properties of adsorbed phase.</description>

      <title>Resonant inter-mode second harmonic generation by backward spin waves in YIG nano-waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear generation of the second harmonic by backward volume spin waves propagating in microscopic magnonic waveguides fabricated from a low-loss magnetic insulator with a thickness of several tens of nanometers. We show that highly efficient resonant second harmonic generation is possible in the inter-mode regime at microwave powers of the order of 10^-4 W. In contrast to previously observed second harmonic generation processes, the generation by backward waves is characterized by the nonlinearly generated waves propagating opposite to the initial waves, and can be realized at zero bias magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Integrated Photonic Programmable Random Matrix Generator with Minimal Active Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrices are fundamental in photonic computing because of their ability to model and enhance complex light interactions and signal processing capabilities. In manipulating classical light, random operations are utilized for random projections and dimensionality reduction, which are important for analog signal processing, computing, and imaging. In quantum information processing, random unitary operations are essential to boson sampling algorithms for multiphoton states in linear photonic circuits. In photonic circuits, random operations are realized through disordered structures resulting in fixed unitary operations or through large meshes of interferometers and reconfigurable phase shifters, which require a large number of phase shifters. In this article, we introduce a compact photonic circuit for generating random matrices by utilizing programmable phase modulation layers interlaced with a fixed mixing operator. We show that using only two random phase layers is sufficient for producing output optical signals with a white-noise profile, even for highly sparse input optical signals. We experimentally demonstrate these results using a silicon photonics circuit with tunable thermal phase shifters and utilize waveguide lattices as mixing layers. The proposed circuit offers a practical method for generating random matrices for photonic information processing and for applications in data encryption.</description>
