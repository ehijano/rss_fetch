      <description>arXiv:2411.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent lattice QCD calculations of the neutron and proton electric dipole moments (EDMs) and the CP-violating $\pi {\rm NN}$ coupling constant due to the $\theta$ term are reviewed. Progress towards nucleon EDM calculations, including the Weinberg three-gluon operator, and the quark chromoelectric dipole moment operator and their renormalization, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Formulation of Path Integrals in Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for Galerkin formulations of path integrals in lattice field theory. The framework is based on using the degrees of freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice variables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the partition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of freedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the two-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on the domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this satisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the continuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order formulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite element spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and numerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the order of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of lattice observables. Finally, we sketch an outline of this Galerkin framework in the context of gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume quantization condition from the $N/D$ representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model-independent method for determining hadronic resonances from lattice QCD. The formalism is derived from the general principles of unitarity and analyticity, as encoded in the $N/D$ representation of a partial-wave two-body amplitude. The associated quantization condition relates the finite-volume spectrum to the infinite-volume numerator, $\mathcal{N}$, used to reconstruct the scattering amplitude from dispersive relations. Unlike the original L\"uscher condition, this new formalism is valid for energies coinciding with the left-hand cuts from arbitrary one- and multi-particle exchanges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FASTSUM Collaboration has developed a comprehensive research programme in thermal lattice QCD using 2+1 flavour ensembles. We review our recent hadron spectrum analyses of open charm mesons and charm baryons at non-zero temperature. We also detail our determination of the interquark potential in the bottomonium system using NRQCD quarks. All of our work uses anisotropic lattices where the temporal lattice spacing is considerably finer than the spatial one allowing better resolution of temporal correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Towards an Effective String Theory for the flux tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to develop an effective string theory capable of describing the confining flux tube has been a longstanding objective within the theoretical physics community. Recent lattice results indicate that the low-lying spectrum of the flux tube in both three and four dimensions can be partially described by the Nambu-Goto string with minor deviations. However, several excitation states exhibit significant corrections that have remained unexplained until recently. Recent advancements suggest that a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) analysis, expanded in both $1/R \sqrt{\sigma}$ and the softness of phonons i.e. $p/\sqrt{\sigma}$, can lead to a robust effective string theory for the flux-tube with length $R$. Furthermore, lattice data points to the existence of an axion field on the world-sheet of the flux-tube, implying that an Axionic String Ansatz (ASA) should accompany the Nambu-Goto framework. We will provide compelling evidence in these proceedings that this approach can closely approximate the flux tube data. We will demonstrate this by comparing results obtained for the spectrum of the closed $SU(N_c)$ flux-tube extracted using lattice techniques in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the 3d Ising Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{+ \pm})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Even though the $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{+-})$ and $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{++})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states under examination in this study have an almost identical mass, the results of the magnetic moments show a discrepancy. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <title>Lattice $\phi^{4}$ field theory as a multi-agent system of financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory with frustrated dynamics as a multi-agent system to reproduce stylized facts of financial markets such as fat-tailed distributions of returns and clustered volatility. Each lattice site, represented by a continuous degree of freedom, corresponds to an agent experiencing a set of competing interactions which influence its decision to buy or sell a given stock. These interactions comprise a cooperative term, which signifies that the agent should imitate the behavior of its neighbors, and a fictitious field, which compels the agent instead to conform with the opinion of the majority or the minority. To introduce the competing dynamics we exploit the Markov field structure to pursue a constructive decomposition of the $\phi^{4}$ probability distribution which we recompose with a Ferrenberg-Swendsen acceptance or rejection sampling step. We then verify numerically that the multi-agent $\phi^{4}$ field theory produces behavior observed on empirical data from the FTSE 100 London Stock Exchange index. We conclude by discussing how the presence of continuous degrees of freedom within the $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory enables a representational capacity beyond that possible with multi-agent systems derived from Ising models.</description>

      <title>Critical fluid dynamics in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a numerical method for simulating stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the Ising universality class. This theory is known as model H, and is expected to govern the non-equilibrium dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) near a possible critical endpoint of the phase transition between a hadron liquid and the quark-gluon plasma. The numerical algorithm is based on a Metropolis scheme, and automatically ensures that the distribution function of the hydrodynamic variables in equilibrium is independent of the transport coefficients and only governed by the microscopic free energy. We verify dynamic scaling near the critical point of a two and three-dimensional fluid and extract the associated critical exponent $z$. We find $z\simeq 3$ in three dimensions, and $z\simeq 2$ for a two-dimensional fluid. In a finite system, we observe a crossover between the mean field value $z=4$ and the true critical exponent $z\simeq 3$ ($z \simeq 2$ in $d=2$). This crossover is governed by the values of the correlation length and the renormalized shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>The non-linear dynamics of axion inflation: a detailed lattice study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the fully inhomogeneous non-linear dynamics of axion inflation, identifying three regimes: weak-, mild-, and strong-backreaction, depending on the duration of inflation. We use lattice techniques that explicitly preserve gauge invariance and shift symmetry, and which we validate against other computational methods of the linear dynamics and of the homogeneous backreaction regime. Notably, we demonstrate that the latter fails to accurately describe the truly local dynamics of strong backreaction. We investigate the convergence of simulations of local backreaction, determining the requirements to achieve an accurate description of the dynamics, and providing useful parametrizations of the delay of the end of inflation. Additionally, we identify key features emerging from a proper local treatment of strong backreaction: the dominance of magnetic energy against the electric counterpart, the excitation of the longitudinal mode, and the generation of a scale-dependent chiral (im)balance. Our results underscore the necessity to accurately capture the local nature of the non-linear dynamics of the system, in order to correctly assess phenomenological predictions, such as e.g. the production of gravitational waves and primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moment of a hadron is an important spectroscopic parameter as its mass and encodes valuable information about its internal structure. In this present study, we systematically study magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and its related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses diquark-diquark-antiquark scheme with $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{5}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. Some of the obtained magnetic moments agree well with the available theoretical results. The predicted magnetic moment values together with alongside results existing in the literature, may offer insights into their underlying structures, and consequently their spin-parity quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Separation of Infrared and Bulk in Thermal QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new thermal regime of QCD, featuring decoupled scale-invariant infrared glue, has been proposed to exist both in pure-glue (N$_f$=0) and ``real-world" (N$_f$=2+1 at physical quark masses) QCD. In this {\it IR phase}, elementary degrees of freedom flood the infrared, forming a distinct component independent from the bulk. This behavior necessitates non-analyticities in the theory. In pure-glue QCD, such non-analyticities have been shown to arise via Anderson-like mobility edges in Dirac spectra ($\lambda_{\rm IR} \!=\! 0$, $\pm \lambda_\text{A} \!\neq\! 0$), as manifested in the dimension function $d_{\rm IR} (\lambda)$. Here, we present the first evidence, based on lattice QCD calculation at $a$=0.105 fm, that this mechanism is also at work in real-world QCD, thus supporting the existence of the proposed IR regime in nature. An important aspect of our results is that, while at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV we find a dimensional jump between zero modes and lowest near-zero modes very close to unity ($d_{\rm IR} \!=\!3$ to $d_{\rm IR} \!\simeq\! 2$), similar to the IR phase of pure-glue QCD, at $T\!=\!187\,$MeV we observe a continuous $\lambda$-dependence. This suggests that thermal states just {\it above} the chiral crossover are non-analytically (in $T$) connected to thermal state at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV, supporting the key original proposition that the transition into the IR regime occurs at a temperature strictly above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>$\omega$ meson from lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: Many excited states in the hadron spectrum have large branching ratios to three-hadron final states. Understanding such particles from first principles QCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson interpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume spectra at unphysical pion mass values to the scattering amplitudes at the physical point. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance parameters of the $\omega$ meson from lattice QCD, including an update of the formalism through matching to effective field theories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the $\omega$ meson at $\sqrt{s_\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\,3.0(5) )\,\mathrm{MeV}$, agrees reasonably well with experiment. In addition we provide an estimate of the $\omega-\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>The hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g{-}2$ using staggered fermions at the physical point</title>

Abstract: Hadronic contributions dominate the uncertainty of the Standard Model prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this work, we present results on the hadronic light-by-light contribution obtained from the evaluation of the hadronic four-point function of electromagnetic currents using the position-space formalism developed by the Mainz group. The simulations are performed with staggered fermions directly at the physical point. Several physical volumes are used to estimate finite volume effects. This direct lattice study is supplemented by considering the contribution of the light pseudoscalar pole in both finite and infinite volumes, where we reuse the pseudoscalar transition form factors that have been evaluated in previous simulations on the same ensembles.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ pure-gauge theory from out-of-equilibrium simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \textit{JHEP} \textbf{04} (2024) 126 [arXiv:2402.06561] we recently proposed an out-of-equilibrium setup to reduce the large auto-correlations of the topological charge in two-dimensional $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ models. Our proposal consists of performing open-boundaries simulations at equilibrium, and gradually switching on periodic boundary conditions out-of-equilibrium. Our setup allows to exploit the reduced auto-correlations achieved with open boundaries, avoiding at the same time unphysical boundary effects thanks to a Jarzynski-inspired reweighting-like procedure. We present preliminary results obtained applying this setup to the $4d$ $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ pure-gauge theory and we outline a computational strategy to mitigate topological freezing in this theory.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ evolution of dipole amplitude in momentum space: forward--off-forward correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have shown that the small-$x$ evolution of the off-forward leading-log dipole scattering amplitudes, both pomeron and odderon, in the momentum space can be completely determined by the evolution of the respective forward amplitudes, with rescaled momenta. In position space, if there is translation symmetry (assumption of a large nucleus), the dipole cross section depends on the positions of quarks and anti-quarks only through their separation. The present study is an equivalent proposition in the momentum space -- where translation symmetry in momentum bifurcates the amplitudes into two translationally symmetric functions along the ${\bf k}$ line in the ${\bf k}-{\bf \Delta}$ plane. It also shows that high energy evolutions of dipole GTMDs can be achieved only by studying the evolution of dipole TMDs at small-$x$.</description>
