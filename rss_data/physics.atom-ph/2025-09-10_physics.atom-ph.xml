      <title>Intensity-dependent precision two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy of Xe using narrow-bandwidth long-pulse deep-UV laser radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a precision measurement of the $(5\mathrm{p})^{5}6\mathrm{p} \, [1/2]_{0}\leftarrow (5\mathrm{p})^{6} \, ^{1}\mathrm{S}_{0}$ transition wavenumber of Xe by Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy using near-Fourier-transform-limited long pulses of UV-laser radiation. The measurements led to absolute uncertainties of 750~kHz in the two-photon transition wavenumbers for the five dominant isotopes of Xe, e.g., 80118.982918(27)~cm$^{-1}$ for $^{136}$Xe. These values were combined with other precision measurements in Xe to resolve an $\sim1~\mathrm{GHz}$ discrepancy between the ionization energy of Xe obtained in recent measurements from the $(6{\rm s})[3/2]_2$ metastable state [Herburger {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. A {\bf 109}, 032816 (2024)] and the ionization energy listed in the NIST atomic database. The analysis indicates that the natural-abundance-weighted ionization energy of Xe should be revised by $-0.023$~cm$^{-1}$ to 97833.7641(20)~cm$^{-1}$. Large fluctuations in the UV-laser pulse intensities were exploited to characterize intensity-dependent shifts of the observed two-photon transition frequencies. Shifts of up to $- 20~\mathrm{MHz}$ were observed and attributed to frequency shifts arising from chirps in the amplification and upconversion of the laser radiation rather than to the ac-Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Isotope shift spectroscopy in mercury vapors: a valid alternative to ytterbium for new physics search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision isotope shift metrology in the deep-UV region has been performed for all bosonic isotopes of mercury with a zero nuclear spin, by using the technique of frequency-comb referenced, wavelength-modulated, saturated absorption spectroscopy. The absolute center frequencies of the 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ 6s6p $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line have been measured with precision in the range of 2.5 - 5.9 10$^{-12}$, in temperature-stabilized mercury vapor samples with natural abundances. Frequency shifts in four isotope pairs have been determined with unprecedented accuracy, the global uncertainty being improved by a factor greater than 20 with respect to the best experimental data of the past literature. Our data set, when combined with previous measurements on the 6s6p $^3$P$_2$$\rightarrow$6s7s $^3$S$_1$ transition at 546 nm, allows us to build a King plot that reveals a nonlinearity with a statistical significance of 4.6$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>All-Order Wichmann and Kroll Contribution in Heavy Electronic and Exotic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the Wichmann and Kroll correction to the one-loop vacuum polarization (VP) to all-orders in $\alpha Z$. We consider electronic, muonic, and antiprotonic atoms for a wide range of nuclear charge numbers and explicitly investigate the influence of finite nuclear size effects and different nuclear models. Moreover, we place special emphasis on circular Rydberg states in the exotic atoms as they have recently attracted interest as a tool to perform isolated tests of strong-field QED. We find that the higher-order vacuum polarization is strongly enhanced in exotic atoms and remains large enough in highly excited Rydberg states that an accurate treatment is crucial for the analysis of upcoming spectroscopy experiments like PAX. Moreover, our calculations show that the VP contribution to the Lamb shift in these exotic Rydberg states has almost no dependence on the structure of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Haldane Model in Thermal Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological materials hold great promise for developing next-generation devices with transport properties that remain resilient in the presence of local imperfections. However, their susceptibility to thermal noise has posed a major challenge. In particular, the Haldane model, a cornerstone in topological physics, generally requires cryogenic temperatures for experimental realization, limiting both the investigation of topologically robust quantum phenomena and their practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a room-temperature realization of the Haldane model using atomic ensembles in momentum-space superradiance lattices, a platform intrinsically resistant to thermal noise. The topological phase transition is revealed through the superradiant emission contrast between two timed Dicke states in the lattice. Crucially, the thermal resilience of this platform allows us to access a deep modulation regime, where topological transitions to high Chern number phases emerge -- going beyond the traditional Haldane model. Our results not only deepen the understanding of exotic topological phases, but also offer a robust, reconfigurable, and room-temperature-compatible platform that connects quantum simulation to real-world quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Testing strong-field QED to second-order in the highly correlated atomic system berylliumlike Pb78+ by electron-ion recombination spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-energy storage ring with an ultracold electron cooler has been coupled with a heavy-ion accelerator facilitating high-resolution electron-ion collision spectroscopy of the heaviest few-electron ions. In the present work resonant electron-ion recombination of berylliumlike Pb$^{78+}$ ions was measured in the collision-energy range 9.3-16.5eV and a value of 244.937(30) eV is derived for the Pb$^{78+}$($2s^2\;^1S_0 - 2s\,2p\;^3P_1$) excitation energy. This result agrees with the most recent (less accurate) theoretical value of 244.942(52) eV [Malyshev et al., Physical Review A 110, 062824 (2024)], which has been calculated by applying strong-field QED rigorously up to the second order. The present investigation suggests that further technical improvements can potentially increase the experimental accuracy by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Plane-Wave Born and Distorted Waves approximations for electron-impact collision strength computations: the sample case of Sr II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger in 2017 (GW170817) and the associated kilonova (AT2017gfo) confirmed these events as key sites for heavy element production through the r-process. Subsequent observations, including late-time spectra with JWST, have highlighted the need for accurate modeling of kilonova ejecta. In the photospheric phase, atomic level populations can be estimated under LTE using Boltzmann and Saha relations, but about a week after the merger the ejecta enters the nebular phase where non-LTE effects dominate. Modeling nebular spectra therefore requires a detailed treatment of radiative and collisional processes that affect the population of atomic levels. This work focuses on electron-impact excitation in Sr II, a heavy ion relevant for kilonova spectra. Two computational approaches are employed: the Plane Wave Born approximation within the pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, and a Distorted Waves method using AUTOSTRUCTURE. The resulting collision strengths are compared against reference R-matrix data to evaluate the accuracy of these approximations and their suitability for large-scale applications to all heavy elements. In addition, radiative parameters for forbidden transitions are computed. These results provide an essential benchmark of approximations that could be used to compute atomic data for nebular-phase kilonova modeling.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Pulse Efficiency Constraints in Atom Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational waves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are designed around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i) Resonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer techniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii) very-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two interferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer techniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse fidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time, increasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller atomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between interferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer pulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be carefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for multi-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a single interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline dimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical analytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be applied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers that demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum transfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of expectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse - highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse fidelities.</description>
