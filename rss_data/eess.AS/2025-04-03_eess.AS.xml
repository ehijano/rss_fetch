      <title>Spatial-Filter-Bank-Based Neural Method for Multichannel Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of deep learning-based multi-channel speech enhancement methods often deteriorates when the geometric parameters of the microphone array change. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue typically involve training on multiple microphone arrays, which can be costly. To address this challenge, we focus on uniform circular arrays and propose the use of a spatial filter bank to extract features that are approximately invariant to geometric parameters. These features are then processed by a two-stage conformer-based model (TSCBM) to enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can be trained on a fixed microphone array while maintaining effective performance across uniform circular arrays with unseen geometric configurations during applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Embedding Techniques in Multimodal Machine Learning for Mental Illness Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing global prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and PTSD, requires objective and scalable diagnostic tools. Traditional clinical assessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and consistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine learning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information available in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and utterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of state-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature extraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion techniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM) predictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron classifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity prediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification (considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that utterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for text and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM predictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8% for depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM architectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of external LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and assessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of MMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental healthcare tools.</description>

      <title>AIM: Acoustic Inertial Measurement for Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>Chain of Correction for Full-text Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-text error correction with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has gained increased attention due to its potential to correct errors across long contexts and address a broader spectrum of error types, including punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization. Nevertheless, many challenges persist, including issues related to stability, controllability, completeness, and fluency. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction with LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text as guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses pre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global semantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content. Utilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in full-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark systems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance under-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely long ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be employed to guide the error correction process.</description>

      <title>Medical Spoken Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract named entities from speech and categorise them into types like person, location, organization, etc. In this work, we present VietMed-NER - the first spoken NER dataset in the medical domain. To our knowledge, our Vietnamese real-world dataset is the largest spoken NER dataset in the world regarding the number of entity types, featuring 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we present baseline results using various state-of-the-art pre-trained models: encoder-only and sequence-to-sequence; and conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis. We found that pre-trained multilingual models generally outperform monolingual models on reference text and ASR output and encoders outperform sequence-to-sequence models in NER tasks. By translating the transcripts, the dataset can also be utilised for text NER in the medical domain in other languages than Vietnamese. All code, data and models are publicly available: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/VietMed-NER.</description>

      <title>How Cyclic Acoustic Patterns Influence ASMR Perception: A Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been remarkably popular in the recent decade. While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses.</description>

      <title>ICSD: An Open-source Dataset for Infant Cry and Snoring Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection and analysis of infant cry and snoring events are crucial tasks within the field of audio signal processing. While existing datasets for general sound event detection are plentiful, they often fall short in providing sufficient, strongly labeled data specific to infant cries and snoring. To provide a benchmark dataset and thus foster the research of infant cry and snoring detection, this paper introduces the Infant Cry and Snoring Detection (ICSD) dataset, a novel, publicly available dataset specially designed for ICSD tasks. The ICSD comprises three types of subsets: a real strongly labeled subset with event-based labels annotated manually, a weakly labeled subset with only clip-level event annotations, and a synthetic subset generated and labeled with strong annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the ICSD creation process, including the challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. We offer a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, discussing its limitations and key factors for ICSD usage. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on the ICSD dataset to establish baseline systems and offer insights into the main factors when using this dataset for ICSD research. Our goal is to develop a dataset that will be widely adopted by the community as a new open benchmark for future ICSD research.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios with Versatile Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings. The code, model, and samples are available at https://github.com/cuhealthybrains/MT-LLM.</description>

      <title>SAV-SE: Scene-aware Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement with Selective State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement plays an essential role in various applications, and the integration of visual information has been demonstrated to bring substantial advantages. However, the majority of current research concentrates on the examination of facial and lip movements, which can be compromised or entirely inaccessible in scenarios where occlusions occur or when the camera view is distant. Whereas contextual visual cues from the surrounding environment have been overlooked: for example, when we see a dog bark, our brain has the innate ability to discern and filter out the barking noise. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, i.e. SAV-SE. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to use rich contextual information from synchronized video as auxiliary cues to indicate the type of noise, which eventually improves the speech enhancement performance. Specifically, we propose the VC-S$^2$E method, which incorporates the Conformer and Mamba modules for their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments are conducted on public MUSIC, AVSpeech and AudioSet datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of VC-S$^2$E over other competitive methods. We will make the source code publicly available. Project demo page: https://AVSEPage.github.io/</description>

      <title>DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at https://dgsna.github.io.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Spike Encoding Methods for Environmental Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach to reduce energy consumption and computational demands, making them particularly beneficial for embedded machine learning in edge applications. However, data from conventional digital sensors must first be converted into spike trains to be processed using neuromorphic computing technologies. The classification of environmental sounds presents unique challenges due to the high variability of frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events. Despite these challenges, most studies on spike-based audio encoding focus on speech processing, leaving non-speech environmental sounds underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of widely used spike encoding techniques, evaluating their effectiveness on the ESC-10 dataset. By understanding the impact of encoding choices on environmental sound processing, researchers and practitioners can select the most suitable approach for real-world applications such as smart surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial acoustic analysis. This study serves as a benchmark for spike encoding in environmental sound classification, providing a foundational reference for future research in neuromorphic audio processing.</description>
