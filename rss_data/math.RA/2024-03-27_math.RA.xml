      <title>X-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evidence a family $\mathcal{X}$ of square matrices over a field $\mathbb{K}$, whose elements will be called X-matrices. We show that this family is shape invariant under multiplication as well as transposition. We show that $\mathcal{X}$ is a (in general non-commutative) subring of $GL(n,\mathbb{K})$. Moreover, we analyse the condition for a matrix $A \in \mathcal{X}$ to be invertible in $\mathcal{X}$. We also show that, if one adds a symmetry condition called here bi-symmetry, then the set $\mathcal{X}^b$ of bi-symmetric X-matrices is a commutative subring of $\mathcal{X}$. We propose results for eigenvalue inclusion, showing that for X-matrices eigenvalues lie exactly on the boundary of Cassini ovals. It is shown that any monic polynomial on $ \mathbb{R} $ can be associated with a companion matrix in $ \mathcal{X} $.</description>

      <title>Exploring Functional Identities: From Division Rings to Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle unresolved inquiries by Ferreira et al. \cite{bruno} in their recent publication, ``Functional Identity on Division Algebras". We delve into the intricate behavior of additive functions on matrix algebras over division rings through rigorous analysis and theorem-proving. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of these functions and their implications for algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Quillen (co)homology of divided power algebras over an operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barr--Beck cohomology, put into the framework of model categories by Quillen, provides a cohomology theory for any algebraic structure, for example Andr\'e--Quillen cohomology of commutative rings. Quillen cohomology has been studied notably for divided power algebras and restricted Lie algebras, both of which are instances of divided power algebras over an operad $\mathcal P$: the commutative and Lie operad respectively. In this paper, we investigate the Quillen cohomology of divided power algebras over an operad $\mathcal P$, identifying Beck modules, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials in that setup. We also compare the cohomology of divided power algebras over $\mathcal P$ with that of $\mathcal P$-algebras, and work out some examples.</description>

      <title>Formal deformations, cohomology theory and $L_\infty[1]$-structures for differential Lie algebras of arbitrary weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalising a previous work of Jiang and Sheng, a cohomology theory for differential Lie algebras of arbitrary weight is introduced. The underlying $L_\infty[1]$-structure on the cochain complex is also determined via a generalised version of higher derived brackets. The equivalence between $L_\infty[1]$-structures for absolute and relative differential Lie algebras are established. Formal deformations and abelian extensions are interpreted by using lower degree cohomology groups. Also we introduce the homotopy differential Lie algebras. In a forthcoming paper, we will show that the operad of homotopy (relative) differential Lie algebras is the minimal model of the operad of (relative) differential Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis deformations of Poisson algebras and $F$-manifold algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of pre-Poisson algebras was introduced by Aguiar in his study of zinbiel algebras and pre-Lie algebras. In this paper, we first introduce NS-Poisson algebras as a generalization of both Poisson algebras and pre-Poisson algebras. An NS-Poisson algebra has an associated sub-adjacent Poisson algebra. We show that a Nijenhuis operator on a Poisson algebra deforms the structure into an NS-Poisson algebra. The semi-classical limit of an NS-algebra deformation and a suitable filtration of an NS-algebra produce NS-Poisson algebras. On the other hand, $F$-manifold algebras were introduced by Dotsenko as the underlying algebraic structure of $F$-manifolds. We also introduce NS-$F$-manifold algebras as a simultaneous generalization of NS-Poisson algebras, $F$-manifold algebras and pre-$F$-manifold algebras. In the end, we show that Nijenhuis deformations of $F$-manifold algebras and the semi-classical limits of NS-pre-Lie algebra deformations have NS-$F$-manifold algebra structures.</description>

      <title>Global Representation Ring and Knutson Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow on from the pioneering paper by the second author where he introduced the Knutson index for the character ring of a finite group. We introduce the Knutson index for general commutative rings. Then we study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks.</description>

      <title>Some remarks regarding special elements in algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process over Zp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide some properties of k-potent elements in algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process over Zp. Moreover, we find a structure of nonunitary ring over Fibonacci quaternions over Z3 and we present a method to encrypt plain texts, by using invertible elements in such algebras.</description>

      <title>The socle of subshift algebras, with applications to subshift conjugacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "irrational paths" for a given subshift and use it to characterize all minimal left ideals in the associated unital subshift algebra. Consequently, we characterize the socle as the sum of the ideals generated by irrational paths. Proceeding, we construct a graph such that the Leavitt path algebra of this graph is graded isomorphic to the socle. This realization allows us to show that the graded structure of the socle serves as an invariant for the conjugacy of Ott-Tomforde-Willis subshifts and for the isometric conjugacy of subshifts constructed with the product topology. Additionally, we establish that the socle of the unital subshift algebra is contained in the socle of the corresponding unital subshift C*-algebra.</description>

      <title>Solid lines in axial algebras of Jordan type half and Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primitive axial algebras of Jordan type $\eta$ were introduced in 2015 by Hall,
  Rehren and Shpectorov. These algebras are not characterized by polynomial identities. Rather, they are required to be generated by primitive idempotents whose multiplication is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $0,1,\eta$, and its eigenvectors multiply following specific fusion rules.
  Based on the concept of solid subalgebras, introduced very recently by Gorshkov, Shpectorov and Staroletov, we provide a criterion for when a primitive axial algebra of Jordan type with parameter $\eta = \frac{1}{2}$ is a Jordan algebra. We also prove that this is equivalent to associators being derivations of the algebra.</description>

      <title>Loop homology of moment-angle complexes in the flag case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Posets of finite GK-dimensional graded pre-Nichols algebras of diagonal type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify graded pre-Nichols algebras of diagonal type with finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. The characterization is made through an isomorphism of posets with the family of appropriate subsets of the set of positive roots coming from central extensions of Nichols algebras of diagonal type, generalizing the corresponding extensions for small quantum groups in de Concini-Kac-Procesi forms of quantum groups.
  On the way to achieving this result, we also classify graded quotients of algebras of functions of unipotent algebraic groups attached to semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable set-theoretical solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation of size $p^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on complex vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. A combinatorial approach is the investigation of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation and their associated algebraic structures. In this article, we focus on indecomposable set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation. More specifically, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and Deformations of left-symmetric Rinehart Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.00335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of left-symmetric Rinehart algebras, which is a generalization of a left-symmetric algebras. The left multiplication gives rise to a representation of the corresponding sub-adjacent Lie-Rinehart algebra. We construct left-symmetric Rinehart algebra from $\mathcal O$-operators on Lie-Rinehart algebra. We extensively investigate representations of a left-symmetric Rinehart algebras. Moreover, we study deformations of left-symmetric Rinehart algebras, which is controlled by the second cohomology class in the deformation cohomology. We also give the relationships between $\mathcal O$-operators and Nijenhuis operators on left-symmetric Rinehart algebras.</description>
