      <title>Fast Comparative Analysis of Merge Trees Using Locality Sensitive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar field comparison is a fundamental task in scientific visualization. In topological data analysis, we compare topological descriptors of scalar fields -- such as persistence diagrams and merge trees -- because they provide succinct and robust abstract representations. Several similarity measures for topological descriptors seem to be both asymptotically and practically efficient with polynomial time algorithms, but they do not scale well when handling large-scale, time-varying scientific data and ensembles. In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our LSH framework in applications such as shape matching, clustering, key event detection, and ensemble summarization.</description>

      <title>Computing shortest paths amid non-overlapping weighted disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an approximation algorithm for solving the Weighted Region Problem amidst a set of $ n $ non-overlapping weighted disks in the plane. For a given parameter $ \varepsilon \in (0,1]$, the length of the approximate path is at most $ (1 +\varepsilon) $ times larger than the length of the actual shortest path. The algorithm is based on the discretization of the space by placing points on the boundary of the disks. Using such a discretization we can use Dijkstra's algorithm for computing a shortest path in the geometric graph obtained in (pseudo-)polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Simplicial maps between spheres and Davis' manifolds with positive simplicial volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the simplicial volume of manifolds obtained from Davis' reflection group trick, the goal being characterizing those having positive simplicial volume. In particular, we focus on checking whether manifolds in this class with nonzero Euler characteristic have positive simplicial volume (Gromov asked whether this holds in general for aspherical manifolds). This leads to a combinatorial problem about triangulations of spheres: we define a partial order on the set of triangulations -- the relation being the existence of a nonzero-degree simplicial map between two triangulations -- and the problem is to find the minimal elements of a specific subposet. We solve explicitly the case of triangulations of the two-dimensional sphere, and then perform an extensive analysis, with the help of computer searches, of the three-dimensional case. Moreover, we present a connection of this problem with the theory of graph minors.</description>
