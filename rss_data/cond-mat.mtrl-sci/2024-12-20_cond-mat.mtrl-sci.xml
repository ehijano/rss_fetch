      <title>Artificial Neural Network based Modelling for Variational Effect on Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.</description>

      <title>New models of clean and hydrogenated amorphous silicon surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new atomistic models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) surfaces. The a-Si model included 4096 atoms and was obtained using local orbital density functional theory. By analyzing a slab model (periodic in two dimensions with a slab about 44 \AA{} thick), we observed a strong correlation between surface structure and surface charge density, which might be compared to STM experiments. Hydrogen atoms added near the under-coordinated surface atoms passivate dangling bonds and induce structural rearrangements. We analyze the electronic structure, including the localization of the states, and note resonant mixing between bulk and surface defect structures. We also compute the classical normal modes of the hydrogenated a-Si and compare them to experiments where possible. Our work is a step toward understanding the meaning of ``surface reconstruction" for a noncrystalline material.</description>

      <title>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</description>

      <title>Influence of Magnetic Anisotropy on the Ground State of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$: Insights into the Improper Modulated Magnetic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid perovskites [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{x-1}$(HCOO)$_3$ with $x$ = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 possess multiple phase transitions including incommensurate structures. [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Ni(HCOO)$_3$ has also been found to have a proper magnetic incommensurate structure in its ground state. We have carried out a detailed structural characterization of the isomorphous [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$ (1) to investigate whether it also has incommensurate structural and magnetic modulations. We confirm that 1 crystallizes in the $Pnma$ space group at room temperature (RT) with a perovskite structure. Upon cooling, at about 170 K, the occurrence of new satellite reflections in the diffraction pattern show a phase transition to a modulated structure, which could be refined in the $Pnma(00\gamma)0s0$ super space group with $q_1~=~0.1662(2)c^\ast$. On further cooling to 75 K the satellite reflections become closer to the main reflections, indicating a new phase transition that keeps the super space group invariant but changes the modulation wave vector, $q_2~=~0.1425(2)c^\ast$. The structure then does not change structural phase down to base temperature (2 K). Magnetic susceptibility measurements collected under field-cooled and zero-field-cooled reveal a 3D antiferromagnetic order below 17 K. The overlapping in temperature between structural modulation and long-range magnetic order presents a unique opportunity to study magneto-structural coupling. Our results point to an improper modulated structure where interestingly the spins oriented strictly antiferromagnetic are perpendicular to those of previously reported compounds. In the present work, a combination of magnetometry measurements, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations have been used to accurately determine and understand the sequence of nuclear and magnetic phases present in compound 1.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for the Most Probable Distribution of Meta-structures in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the principle of equal probability proposed by Boltzmann in the 1870s, we establish a theoretical framework for the most probable distribution of meta-structures in materials. Furthermore, we validate the reliability of this theoretical framework based on statistical results of these meta-structures within randomly generated binary alloys. Finally, combining this theoretical framework, the high-throughput first-principles computations and machine learning, we determine the atomic chemical potentials in the binary FeCr alloy, thereby providing a demonstrative application. This theoretical framework will open a new research area and lay a foundation for the atomic-scale design of targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of cross terms of Onsager formalism (vacancy wind effect) considering the molar volume of diffusing elements in ternary and multicomponent solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes the correlation between intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients, considering actual molar volumes of the diffusing elements established in guidance to earlier analysis proposed by Manning. Manning established this correlation by assuming constant molar volume variation and mentioning the need for correction when molar volume is not constant. On the other hand, molar volume variation is never exactly constant, which may vary ideally or non-ideally in solid solutions. A recent study in the binary systems indicates that consideration of molar volumes of the elements following the ideal variation, when actual non-ideal molar volume variation is not available, estimated more accurate data instead of consideration of constant molar volume variation. The same is expected for ternary and multicomponent systems. This could not have been practised earlier because of the non-availability of this correlation between intrinsic and tracer diffusion coefficients, but it is possible now with the analysis proposed in this article. This correlation for constrained diffusion couples, such as binary and pseudo-ternary diffusion, is also established. Therefore, the outcome of this study is expected to bring a major change in diffusion analysis in ternary and multicomponent systems in future.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization dynamics of photoinjected carriers at the band edge in room-temperature silicon studied by terahertz polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixfold-degenerate valleys in Si have attracted considerable attention for valleytronics application. Using optical pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy, we study the dynamics of valley polarization in bulk Si(001) at room temperature. Linearly polarized pump pulses excite electrons and holes with asymmetric distributions in momentum space, leading to in-plane anisotropic conductivity. By varying the polarization directions of the pump light relative to the in-plane crystalline axes, the valley polarization of electrons and the momentum asymmetry of holes are separately probed through observing the polarization rotation of THz pulses. We demonstrate that the valley relaxation time of electrons near the conduction band minimum exceeds 1.5 ps at room temperature, in good agreement with theoretically calculated intervalley phonon scattering with f-process. This work paves the way for Si-based room-temperature valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Optical Properties of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ Monolayer: A First-principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal structure, stability, electronic and optical properties of the Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ monolayer have been investigated using first-principles calculations in combination with the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The results show that it is feasible to directly exfoliate a Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ monolayer from the low-temperature monoclinic phase. The monolayer is stable and behaves as a normal narrow-gap semiconductor with neither spontaneous excitons nor non-trivial topology. Despite the quasi-particle and optical gaps of only 266 and 200 meV, respectively, its optically-active exciton has a binding energy up to 66 meV and can exist at room temperature. This makes it valuable for applications in infrared photodetection, especially its inherent in-plane anisotropy adds to its value in polarization sensing. It is also found that the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling is theoretically necessary to properly elucidate the optical and excitonic properties of monolayer.</description>

      <title>An ab initio description of the family of Cr selenides: structure, magnetism and electronic structure from bulk to the single-layer limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compounds based on Cr have been found to be among the first single-layer magnets. In addition, transition metal dichalcogenides are promising candidates to show long-range ferromagnetic order down to the two-dimensional limit. We use ab initio calculations to provide a description of the various Cr$_x$Se$_{x+1}$ stoichiometries that may occur by analyzing from the bulk materials to the monolayer limit. We study the different structural distortions, including charge density waves that each system can present by analyzing their phonon spectra and dynamic stability. We provide a description of their basic electronic structure and study their magnetic properties, including the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. The evolution of all these properties with the dimensionality of the systems is discussed. This intends to be a comprehensive view of the broad family of Cr selenides.</description>

      <title>Sticking coefficient for atoms impinging on a metallic surfaces, and the x-ray photoemission by metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium electron-gas systems exhibit rich physics, which we explore through three problems. First, we study photoemission from metals, traditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission rate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation amplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical results reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation processes: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other following the faster Nozi\`eres-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting this feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we examine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential ramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the parameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum Adiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show that the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates non-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen atom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an image-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless model, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the sticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface. The coefficient peaks near 300 meV, balancing non-adiabatic contributions, which increase with energy, and the traversal time through the interaction region. Numerical results align semi-quantitatively with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the dimensionless figure of merit zT is central to developing better thermoelectric materials and advancing thermoelectric generation technology. However, the intrinsic interdependence between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity presents a significant challenge. Over time, various strategies have emerged, but the literature remains difficult to navigate due to its widespread distribution across numerous sources. This short review highlights the key approaches to improving zT, offering a clear and concise guide to help researchers understand the major ideas and breakthroughs in the field.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities can strongly influence dislocation behavior and thus impact plasticity. Quantifying dislocation-impurity interactions in $\alpha$-Fe from ab initio across a wide temperature range is challenging due to paramagnetism at elevated temperatures. In this work, we investigate the energy profiles and segregation behavior of various 3d elements - V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co - in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic state with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach using ab initio methods. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to elastic size effects, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Charge Carrier Cooling on the Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ shows promise for solution-processable optoelectronics, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis and X-ray detection. However, various spectroscopic studies report rapid charge carrier mobility loss in the first picosecond after photoexcitation, limiting carrier collection efficiencies. The origin of this rapid mobility loss is still unclear. Here, we directly compare hot excitation with excitation over the indirect fundamental bandgap, using transient absorption and THz spectroscopy on the same Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ thin film sample. From transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that hot carriers cool towards the band-edges with a cooling rate of 0.58 ps$^{-1}$, which coincides with the observed mobility loss rate from THz spectroscopy. Hence, our study establishes a direct link between the hot carrier cooling and ultrafast mobility loss on the picosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Graph-neural-network predictions of solid-state NMR parameters from spherical tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.</description>

      <title>Creating currents of electric bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental demonstration of electric skyrmion bubbles and the recent prediction of their Brownian motion have brought topological ferroelectrics close to their magnetic counterparts. Electric bubbles (e-bubbles) could potentially be leveraged in applications for which magnetic skyrmions have been proposed (e.g., neuromorphic computing). Yet, we still lack a strategy to create currents of e-bubbles. Here, using predictive atomistic simulations, we illustrate two approaches to induce e-bubble currents by application of suitable electric fields, static or dynamic. We focus on regimes where e-bubbles display spontaneous diffusion, which allows us to generate a current by simply biasing their Brownian motion. Our calculations indicate that e-bubble velocities over 25 m/s can be achieved at room temperature, suggesting that these electric quasiparticles could rival the speeds of magnetic skyrmions upon further optimization.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Enhancement of Superfluid Density in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with and without Charge Density Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly within the (4H/2H)-NbX$_{2}$ (X=Se,S) family, remains an open and intriguing challenge. A systematic microscopic study across various compounds in this family is therefore required to unravel this complex interplay. Here, we report on muon spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments investigating the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$), the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_\mathrm{eff}$), and the charge density wave order (CDW) in two layered chalcogenide superconductors: 4H-NbSe$_{2}$, which exhibits CDW order, and 2H-NbS$_{2}$, which lacks such order. Our observations reveal a substantial 75$\%$ enhancement of the superfluid density ($n_{s}/m^{*}$) in 4H-NbSe$_{2}$ upon maximum applied pressure of 2 GPa, surpassing that of 2H-NbSe$_{2}$. Despite the absence of CDW order, a sizeable 20$\%$ growth in superfluid density is also observed for 2H-NbS$_{2}$ under an applied pressure of 1.8 GPa. Notably, the evaluated superconducting gaps in all these TMDs remain largely unaffected by changes in applied pressure, irrespective of pressure-induced partial suppression of CDW order in (4H/2H)-NbSe$_{2}$ or its general absence in 2H-NbS$_{2}$. These results underscore the complex nature of pressure-induced behaviors in these TMDs, challenging a simplistic view of competition solely between CDW order and superconductivity. Remarkably, the relationship between $n_{s}/m^{*}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits an unconventional correlation, indicating a noteworthy similarity with the behavior observed in cuprate, kagome, and iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Aspect ratio controls hot-carrier generation in gold nanobricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic or "hot" electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles have great potential for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensing. Here, we study the generation of hot carriers in brick-shaped gold nanoparticles using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution to Maxwell's equation with large-scale tight-binding simulations to evaluate Fermi's Golden Rule. We find that hot-carrier generation depends sensitively on the aspect ratio of the nanobricks with flatter bricks producing a large number of energetic electrons irrespective of the light polarization. In contrast, the hot-carrier generation rates of elongated nanobricks exhibits a strong dependence on the light polarization. The insights resulting from our calculations can be harnessed to design nanobricks that produce hot carriers with properties tailored to specific device applications.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry solutions in one-dimensional lattice models via many-body perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic inversion method based on the sum-over-pole representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\"uter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity in the Kohn-Sham potential, which gives a measure of how the Kohn-Sham gap approximates the many-body fundamental gap of these systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</description>

      <title>Dielectric response in twisted MoS2 bilayer facilitated by spin-orbit coupling effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals bilayers offer ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms for exploring the intricate interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons. By investigating twisted MoS2 bilayer, featuring two distinct stackings but with identical commensurate supercell sizes, we reveal an unusual dielectric response behavior inherent to this system. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the application of an out-of-plane electric field gives different responses in electronic polarization. Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that this dielectric response comes from the planar charge redistribution associated with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The underlying mechanism lies in the fact that the external electric field tends to modify the internal pseudo-spin texture \sigma, subsequently generating an out-of-plane (pseudo-) spin current j_s \propto \sigma \times B_R as response to an in-plane pseudomagnetic field B_R through Rashba SOC. It is found that the generated j_s is opposite for the two distinct stackings, resulting in opposite in-plane electric susceptibility. As a consequence, through magnetoelectric coupling within such nonmagnetic system, there give rise to opposite tendency to redistribute charge, ultimately leading to an amplified or suppressed dielectric response.</description>

      <title>Vertically Graded Fe-Ni Alloys with Low Damping and a Sizeable Spin-Orbit Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-efficient spintronic devices require a large spin-orbit torque (SOT) and low damping to excite magnetic precession. In conventional devices with heavy-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, reducing the ferromagnet thickness to $\sim$1 nm enhances the SOT but dramatically increases damping. Here, we investigate an alternative approach based on a 10 nm thick single-layer ferromagnet to attain both low damping and a sizable SOT. Instead of relying on a single interface, we continuously break the bulk inversion symmetry with a vertical compositional gradient of two ferromagnetic elements: Fe with low intrinsic damping and Ni with sizable spin-orbit coupling. We find low effective damping parameters of $\alpha_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 5\times10^{-3}$ in the FeNi alloy films, despite the steep compositional gradients. Moreover, we reveal a sizable anti-damping SOT efficiency of $|\theta_\mathrm{DL}| \approx 0.05$, even without an intentional compositional gradient. Through depth-resolved x-ray diffraction, we identify a lattice strain gradient as crucial symmetry breaking that underpins the SOT. Our findings provide fresh insights into damping and SOTs in single-layer ferromagnets for power-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic excitation spectrum of a material characterises the response to external electromagnetic perturbations through its energy loss function (ELF), which is obtained from several experimental sources that usually do not completely agree among them. In this work, we assess the available ELF of three metals, namely chromium, palladium, and samarium, by using the dielectric formalism to calculate relevant stopping quantities, such as the stopping cross sections for protons and alpha particles, as well as the corresponding electron inelastic mean free paths. The comparison of these quantities (as calculated from different sets of ELF) with the available experimental data for each of the analyzed metals highlights the promising capability of the recently proposed reverse Monte Carlo method for the determination of the ELF. This work also analyzes the contribution of different electronic shells to the electronic excitation spectra of these materials, and reveals the important role that the excitation of "semi-core" bands plays on the energy loss mechanism for these metals.</description>

Abstract: X-ray-induced carrier dynamics in silicon and gallium arsenide were investigated through intensity variations of transmitted terahertz (THz) pulses in the pico to microsecond time scale with X-ray free-electron laser and synchrotron radiation. We observed a steep reduction in THz transmission with a picosecond scale due to the X-ray-induced carrier generation, followed by a recovery on a nano to microsecond scale caused by the recombination of carriers. The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and X-ray pulses for THz pump-X-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</description>

      <title>Understanding High Coercivity in ThMn12-Type Sm-Zr-Fe-Co-Ti Permanent Magnet Powders through Nanoscale Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ThMn12-type (Sm,Zr)1(Fe,Co,Ti)12 compounds show great potential for permanent magnets. Magnetically hard anisotropic powders prepared via reduction-diffusion exhibit a significant increase in coercivity from 0.45 T to 1.26 T as the processing temperature is raised from 990{\deg}C to 1220{\deg}C. Structural and microchemical analyses at high-resolution reveal that high-temperature processing annihilates grain boundaries (GBs) and reduces the density of twin boundaries (TBs), which are defects acting as weak links limiting the coercivity in the 1:12 system. Ostwald ripening is proposed as the mechanism behind the reduction of GB and TB densities at higher temperature, driven by the reduction in interfacial energy and enhancing atomic structural uniformity.</description>

Abstract: 2:17 SmCo magnets with a quinary composition of Sm(Co,Cu,Fe,Zr)$_{7+{\delta}}$ are industrially relevant hard magnets used in high temperature and corrosive environments. Their complex cellular/lamellar nanostructure, consisting of ordered 2:17 phase cells, 1:5 phase cell boundaries and Z-phase (Zr-rich) lamellae, is essential for their high coercivity. However, the system's complexity makes it challenging to determine the contribution of each element or microstructural feature to coercivity. To disentangle the microstructure-property relationships, we simplified the system to binary and ternary SmCo$_{7.7-x}$Zr$_x$ (with $x = 0$ and 0.1) magnets and conducted detailed micro- to atomic-scale analyses. Only Zr-containing magnets formed a cellular/lamellar nanostructure akin to industrial magnets, in Zr-rich regions with at least 1 at.% Zr, but without achieving high coercivity due to low elemental gradients in absence of Cu across cell boundaries. Data from Zr-poor areas of SmCo$_{7.6}$Zr$_{0.1}$ suggests that 2:17 phase twin boundaries facilitate cellular nanostructure formation by providing inhomogeneities for heterogeneous nucleation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>

      <title>Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Based Deep Learning for Predicting Structural and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning approach to predicting structural and electronic properties of materials using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Leveraging data from the Materials Project database, we construct graph representations of crystal structures and employ GNNs to predict multiple properties simultaneously. All crystal structures are from the Materials Project database, with a total of 158,874 structures used. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across various properties, as indicated by \( R^2 \) values: 0.96 for density, 0.97 for formation energy, 0.54 for energy above hull, 0.47 for structural stability (is\_S), 0.76 for band gap, 0.86 for valence band maximum, 0.78 for conduction band minimum, and 0.82 for Fermi energy. These results demonstrate the potential of GNNs in materials science, offering a powerful tool for rapid screening and discovery of materials with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Topological columnar nano-SQUID based on a 3D topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding an ideal platform to generate non-Abelian Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) is a crucial first step for topological quantum computing. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform that gives rise to a robust topological phase and can realize a well-defined fermion parity necessary for quantum computing. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We demonstrate that a TI device of this structure indeed presents SQUID-type oscillations of the critical current $I_c$ as a function of $\Phi$ with period $\Phi_{0}^s=\frac{h}{2e}$. It can be tuned by a back gate to attain a full $I_c$ suppression and then a nearly-full recovery as a function of $\Phi$, an indication that the superconductivity is completely surface-dominated. Our theory shows that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase hosting MZMs occurs periodically for $(n-\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s &lt; \Phi &lt; (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_{0}^s$ with odd-integer $n$.</description>
