      <title>An Update on the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the beam pattern response are needed to predict the response of a radio telescope. Mapping the beam of a low frequency radio array presents a unique challenge and science cases such as the observation of the 21\,cm line at high redshift have demanding requirements. Drone-based systems offer the unique potential for a measurement which is entirely under experimenter control, but progress has been paced by practical implementation challenges. Previously, a prototype drone system, called the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories (ECHO), demonstrated good performance in making a complete hemispherical beam measurement. This paper reports updates to the system focusing on performance of a new drone platform, minimizing interference from the drone, and a new transmitter.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results of the Single Event Effect testing for the ULTRASAT sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ULTRASAT (ULtra-violet TRansient Astronomy SATellite) is a wide-angle space telescope that will perform a deep time-resolved all-sky survey in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectrum. The science objectives are the detection of counterparts to short-lived transient astronomical events such as gravitational wave sources and supernovae. The mission is led by the Weizmann Institute of Science and is planned for launch in 2026 in collaboration with the Israeli Space Agency and NASA. DESY will provide the UV camera, composed by the detector assembly located in the telescope focal plane and the remote electronics unit. The camera is composed out of four back-metallized CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) manufactured in the 4T, dual gain Tower process. As part of the radiation qualification of the camera, Single Event Effect (SEE) testing has been performed by irradiating the sensor with heavy ions at the RADEF, Jyvaskyla facility. Preliminary results of both Single Event Upset (SEU) and Single Event Latch-up (SEL) occurrence rate in the sensor are presented. Additionally, an in-orbit SEE rate simulation has been performed in order to gain preliminary knowledge about the expected effect of SEE on the mission.</description>

      <title>Astrophotonic Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, photonics have been developed as technological solutions for astronomical instrumentation for, e.g., near-infrared spectroscopy and long baseline interferometry. With increasing instrument capabilities, large quantities of high precision optical components are required to guide, manipulate, and analyze the light from astronomical sources. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and fiber-based devices offer enormous potential for astronomical instrumentation, as they can reduce the amount of bulky free-space optics and pave the way for innovative solutions. Astrophotonic devices are particularly interesting for interferometry due to their compact design on the centimeter scale, even for a large number of telescope inputs. Already, astrophotonic components are integrated in high-end instruments at the VLTI and at the CHARA Array. Photonic beam combiners at wavelengths from visible to mid-infrared have been fabricated using lithographic techniques or ultrafast-laser inscription, with several components tested on-sky. This paper will provide a glimpse into the growing field of astrophotonics, its current status and potential for new technologies.</description>

      <title>Centroiding Undersampled PSFs with a Lookup Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method of centroiding undersampled point spread functions (PSFs) that may be useful, especially when dithering is not an option. If the profile of the expected PSF is known fairly well through characterization of the telescope and detector used for observing, one can simulate the undersampled PSF at many positions on a simulated pixel grid. The true centroid positions are known since the PSFs are simulated, and so one can match up each undersampled PSF images to its true centroid location, thus forming a lookup table. One then assigns the centroid position of an observed PSF to the position associated with the PSF in the lookup table that has the smallest squared residual with respect to the observed PSF. We examine a few PSF sizes and demonstrate that the lookup table provides better centroid positions compared to a fitting algorithm when the PSFs are undersampled, even in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>The evaluation of the CUSP scientific performance by a GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It is approved for a Phase B study. In this work, we report on the accurate simulation of the detector's response to evaluate the scientific performance. A GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the physical interactions of the source photons with the detector and the passive materials. Using this approach, we implemented a detailed CUSP Mass Model. In this work, we report on the evaluation of the detector's effective area as a function of the beam energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project aims to develop a constellation of two CubeSats orbiting the Earth to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter on board of each satellite. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures. CUSP is a project approved for a Phase B study by the Italian Space Agency in the framework of the Alcor program aimed to develop CubeSat technologies and missions. In this paper we describe the a method for a multi-physical simulation analysis while analyzing some possible design optimization of the payload design solutions adopted. In particular, we report the mechanical design for each structural component, the results of static and dynamic finite element analysis, the preliminary thermo-mechanical analysis for two specific thermal cases (hot and cold orbit) and a topological optimization of the interface between the platform and the payload.</description>

Moreover, the APDs were also characterized as being coupled to a GAGG scintillator.</description>

Abstract: The BlueWalker 3 satellite is now fainter than during the first months after deployment. The greatest improvement is that the average maximum luminosity near zenith has been reduced from magnitude 1.0 to 2.2. However, the spacecraft is still usually bright enough to interfere with astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Heimdallr and Solarstein: alignment, calibration, and correction in the Asgard suite at the VLTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Asgard instrument suite proposed for the ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) brings with it a new generation of instruments for spectroscopy and nulling. Asgard will enable investigations such as measurement of direct stellar masses for Galactic archaeology and direct detection of giant exoplanets to probe formation models using the first nulling interferometer in the southern hemisphere. We present the design and implementation of the Astralis-built Heimdallr, the beam combiner for fringe tracking and stellar interferometry in K band, as well as Solarstein, a novel implementation of a 4-beam telescope simulator for alignment and calibration. In this update, we verify that the Heimdallr design is sufficient to perform diffraction-limited beam combination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Solarstein presents an interface comparable to the VLTI with co-phased, equal intensity beams, enabling alignment and calibration for all Asgard instruments. In doing so, we share techniques for aligning and implementing large instruments in bulk optics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-induced force noise in LISA Pathfinder free-falling test masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LISA Pathfinder was a mission designed to test key technologies required for gravitational wave detection in space. Magnetically driven forces play a key role in the instrument sensitivity in the low-frequency regime, which corresponds to the measurement band of interest for future space-borne gravitational wave observatories. Magnetic-induced forces couple to the test mass motion, introducing a contribution to the relative acceleration noise between the free falling test masses. In this Letter we present the first complete estimate of this term of the instrument performance model. Our results set the magnetic-induced acceleration noise during the February 2017 noise run of $\rm 0.25_{-0.08}^{+0.15}\,fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1 mHz and $\rm 1.01_{-0.24}^{+0.73}\, fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss how the non-stationarities of the interplanetary magnetic field can affect these values during extreme space weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements of the magnetic parameters of LISA Pathfinder test masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise characterization of the magnetic properties of LISA Pathfinder free falling test-masses is of special interest for future gravitational wave observatory in space. Magnetic forces have an important impact on the instrument sensitivity in the low frequency regime below the millihertz. In this paper we report on the magnetic injection experiments performed throughout LISA Pathfinder operations. We show how these experiments allowed a high precision estimate of the instrument magnetic parameters. The remanent magnetic moment was found to have a modulus of $(0.245\pm0.081)\,\rm{nAm}^2$, the x-component of the background magnetic field within the test masses position was measured to be $(414 \pm 74)$ nT and its gradient had a value of $(-7.4\pm 2.1)\,\mu$T/m. Finally, we also measured the test mass magnetic susceptibility to be $(-3.35\pm0.15)\times$10$^{-5}$ in the low frequency regime. All results are in agreement with on-ground estimates.</description>

      <title>Thermal and mechanical study of a parametrised cryostat model for optical characterisation of upcoming CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future experiments observing the cosmic microwave background require a detailed understanding of optical performance at cryogenic temperatures. Pre-deployment analysis of optics can be performed in custom-engineered cryogenic test beds, such as Mod-Cam, a first light camera for the CCAT project. This work presents studies of the mechanical and thermal performance of CryoSim, a model of a generic cylindrical 4-K cryostat cooled with a commercial pulse tube cryocooler that can be used to characterise optical components and full reimaging optical systems. CryoSim is extensively parametrised, allowing the joint analysis and optimisation of mechanical and thermal performance via finite element methods. Results from this model are validated against measured cooldown data of the Mod-Cam cryostat. Due to the extensive parametrisation of the model, significant modifications of the cryostat geometry may be implemented to be representative of any system the scientific community may desire, and validation of thermal and mechanical performance can be carried out rapidly.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and Performance of LBTI/NOMIC Spectroscopy: Prospects for 10- and 30-meter class Mid-IR Exoplanet Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long wavelength infrared (8-13 $\mu$m) spectroscopy is invaluable for detecting molecular features in the atmospheres of gas giant and terrestrial exoplanets. The nulling-optimized mid-infrared camera (NOMIC) on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) has a low resolution (R$\sim$200) germanium grism that was previously installed but has not been characterized and commissioned for scientific observations. Using a 1.27 mm slit and broadband filter in combination with the grism, the infrared window between 8-13 $\mu$m can be captured. We describe initial on sky testing of the LBTI/NOMIC grism mode with adaptive optics to study standard stars and binaries. We discuss the impact of observational strategy and telluric calibration on the spectral reduction process. We infer the impact of existing mid-infrared detectors on NOMIC's spectroscopic mode and discuss requirements to enable higher resolution 8-13 $\mu$m spectroscopy on current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Measuring stellar surface rotation and activity with the PLATO mission -- I. Strategy and application to simulated light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars mission (PLATO) will allow us to measure surface rotation and monitor photometric activity of tens of thousands of main sequence solar-type and subgiant stars. This paper is the first of a series dedicated to the preparation of the analysis of stellar surface rotation and photospheric activity with the near-future PLATO data. We describe in this work the strategy that will be implemented in the PLATO pipeline to measure stellar surface rotation, photometric activity, and long-term modulations. The algorithms are applied on both noise-free and noisy simulations of solar-type stars, which include activity cycles, latitudinal differential rotation, and spot evolution. PLATO simulated systematics are included in the noisy light curves. We show that surface rotation periods can be recovered with confidence for most of the stars with only six months of observations and that the {recovery rate} of the analysis significantly improves as additional observations are collected. This means that the first PLATO data release will already provide a substantial set of measurements for this quantity, with a significant refinement on their quality as the instrument obtains longer light curves. Measuring the Schwabe-like magnetic activity cycle during the mission will require that the same field be observed over a significant timescale (more than four years). Nevertheless, PLATO will provide a vast and robust sample of solar-type stars with constraints on the activity-cycle length. Such a sample is lacking from previous missions dedicated to space photometry.</description>

      <title>Projections of the uncertainty on the compact binary population background using popstock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has announced the detection of almost 100 binary black holes so far, which have been used in several studies to infer the features of the underlying binary black hole population. From these, it is possible to predict the overall gravitational-wave (GW) fractional energy density contributed by black holes throughout the Universe, and thus estimate the gravitational-wave background (GWB) spectrum emitted in the current GW detector band. These predictions are fundamental in our forecasts for background detection and characterization, with both present and future instruments. The uncertainties in the inferred population strongly impact the predicted energy spectrum, and in this paper we present a new, flexible method to quickly calculate the energy spectrum for varying black hole population features such as the mass spectrum and redshift distribution. We implement this method in an open-access package, popstock, and extensively test its capabilities. Using popstock, we investigate how uncertainties in these distributions impact our detection capabilities and present several caveats for background estimation. In particular, we find that the standard assumption that the background signal follows a 2/3 power-law at low frequencies is both waveform and mass-model dependent, and that the signal power-law is likely shallower than previously modelled, given the current waveform and population knowledge.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR as an Axion Helioscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter in the Universe is still an open question in astrophysics and cosmology. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) offer a compelling solution, and traditionally ground-based experiments have eagerly, but to date unsuccessfully, searched for these hypothetical low-mass particles that are expected to be produced in large quantities in the strong electromagnetic fields in the interior of stars. This work offers a fresh look at axions and ALPs by leveraging their conversion into X-rays in the magnetic field of the Sun's atmosphere rather than a laboratory magnetic field. Unique data acquired with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) during the solar minimum in 2020 allows us to set stringent limits on the coupling of axions to photons using state-of-the-art magnetic field models of the solar atmosphere. We report pioneering limits on the axion-photon coupling strength of $6.9\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 2\times 10^{-7}$ eV, surpassing current ground-based searches and further probing unexplored regions of the axion-photon coupling parameter space up to axion masses of $m_a \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Silkscreen: Direct Measurements of Galaxy Distances from Survey Image Cutouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Traditional techniques such as tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce Silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network to extract summary statistics from the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 &lt; D ({\rm Mpc)} &lt; 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of amortized inference. For surveys like LSST, Silkscreen, once amortized, will facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. While we focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XII. A new grid of northern standards for the spectral classification of B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>NICER timing of the X-ray thermal isolated neutron star RX J0806.4--4123</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for precise monitoring of the loop gain of transition edge sensors (TES) under electrothermal feedback. The measurement is implemented on the ICE DfMux electronics and operates simultaneously with Digital Active Nulling (DAN). It uses one additional bias sinusoid per TES and does not require any additional readout channels. The loop gain monitor is being implemented on the Simons Array and is an integral part of the baseline calibration strategy for the upcoming LiteBIRD satellite.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Neural Ratio Estimation for Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation is usually cast as either a binary (NRE-A) or a multiclass (NRE-B) classification task. In contrast to the binary classification framework, the current formulation of the multiclass version has an intrinsic and unknown bias term, making otherwise informative diagnostics unreliable. We propose a multiclass framework free from the bias inherent to NRE-B at optimum, leaving us in the position to run diagnostics that practitioners depend on. It also recovers NRE-A in one corner case and NRE-B in the limiting case. For fair comparison, we benchmark the behavior of all algorithms in both familiar and novel training regimes: when jointly drawn data is unlimited, when data is fixed but prior draws are unlimited, and in the commonplace fixed data and parameters setting. Our investigations reveal that the highest performing models are distant from the competitors (NRE-A, NRE-B) in hyperparameter space. We make a recommendation for hyperparameters distinct from the previous models. We suggest two bounds on the mutual information as performance metrics for simulation-based inference methods, without the need for posterior samples, and provide experimental results. This version corrects a minor implementation error in $\gamma$, improving results.</description>

      <title>The Obsidian model: Three regimes of black hole feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theoretical models of galaxy evolution, black hole feedback is a necessary ingredient in order to explain the observed exponential decline in number density of massive galaxies. Most contemporary black hole feedback models in cosmological simulations rely on a constant radiative efficiency (usually $\eta \sim 0.1$) at all black hole accretion rates. We present the Obsidian sub-grid model, a synthesis model for the spin-dependent radiative efficiencies of three physical accretion rate regimes, i.e. $\eta = \eta(j, \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc})$, for use in large-volume cosmological simulations. The three regimes include: an advection dominated accretion flow ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &lt; 0.03\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$), a quasar-like mode ($0.03 &lt; \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 0.3$), and a slim disc mode ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &gt; 0.3\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$). Additionally, we include a large-scale powerful jet at low accretion rates. The black hole feedback model we present is a kinetic model that prescribes mass loadings but could be used in thermal models directly using the radiative efficiency. We implement the Obsidian model into the Simba galaxy evolution model to determine if it is possible to reproduce galaxy populations successfully, and provide a first calibration for further study. Using a $2\times1024^3$ particle cosmological simulation in a $(150\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume, we found that the model is successful in reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function, black hole mass-stellar mass relationship, and stellar mass-halo mass relationship. Moving forward, this model opens new avenues for exploration of the impact of black hole feedback on galactic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The future Japanese project for the detection of gravitational waves in space is planned as DECIGO. To achieve various scientific missions, including the verification of cosmic inflation through the detection of primordial gravitational waves as the main objective, DECIGO is designed to have high sensitivity in the frequency band from $0.1$ to $1$ Hz, with arms of length 1000 km. Furthermore, the use of the Fabry-Perot cavity in these arms has been established for the DECIGO project. In this paper, we scrutinize the significance of the Fabry-Perot cavity for promoting this project, with a focus on the possibility of observing gravitational waves from cosmic inflation and binary compact star systems as indicators. The results show that using the Fabry-Perot cavity is extremely beneficial for detecting them, and it is anticipated to enable the opening of a new window in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Pluto fly-by of the New Horizons spacecraft, the mission provided a unique opportunity to explore the Kuiper Belt in-situ. The possibility existed to fly-by a Kuiper Belt object (KBO) as well as to observe additional objects at distances closer than are feasible from earth-orbit facilities. However, at the time of launch no KBOs were known about that were accessible by the spacecraft. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of observations and three uniquely dedicated efforts -- two ground-based using the Subaru Suprime Camera, the Magellan MegaCam and IMACS Cameras, and one with the Hubble Space Telescope -- to find such KBOs for study. In this paper we overview the search criteria and strategies employed in our work and detail the analysis efforts to locate and track faint objects in the galactic plane. We also present a summary of all of the KBOs that were discovered as part of our efforts and how spacecraft targetability was assessed, including a detailed description of our astrometric analysis which included development of an extensive secondary calibration network. Overall, these efforts resulted in the discovery of 89 KBOs including 11 which became objects for distant observation by New Horizons and (486958) Arrokoth which became the first post-Pluto fly-by destination.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 Iberian superbolide from a sunskirting orbit: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>

Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 1 m, entering the atmosphere at 40.4 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ with an average slope of 8.5$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 133 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit had an inclination of 16.4$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.952, a semi-major axis of 2.4 au, and a short perihelion distance of 0.12 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN) and the European Space Agency (ESA), as well as by the U.S. Government (USG) sensors from space. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 0.56$^\circ$ and 0.1 km$\,$s$^{-1}$, respectively. The presence of detached fragments in the lower part of the luminous trajectory suggests that the meteoroid was a polymict carbonaceous chondrite, containing higher-strength macroscopic particles in its interior due to collisional gardening, or a thermally processed C-type asteroid. The orbital elements indicate that the most likely source is the Jupiter-Family Comet (JFC) region, aligning with the SOHO comet family, as its sunskirting orbit is decoupled from Jupiter. This event provides important information to characterize the disruption mechanism of near-Sun objects.</description>
