      <title>"Benchmark" Performance Analysis and Covariance Matrix-Free Calibration of Uniform Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of uniform linear array (with uniform mutual coupling) calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation are re-examined for application in the receive arrays of modern High Frequency Over-the-Horizon Radars (HF OTHR). Specifics of these arrays, operating predominantly in the "over-sampled" (d/$\lambda$ &lt; 0.5) regime, are exploited along with the recent findings in the Toeplitz Inverse Eigenvalue problem (ToIEP), Random Matrix Theory, and the "Expected Likelihood" methodology developed earlier to advance the problem solution. In this paper we re-evaluate the benchmark efficiency of the "blind" calibration and analyze several techniques that are based on certain properties of the Toeplitz covariance matrix and "over-sampled" uniform antenna arrays, but do not require matrix estimation. In Part II we analyze the case of the unknown symmetric and Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and introduce techniques for joint antenna calibration and Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation.</description>

      <title>Optimized Tone Reservation for Opportunistic OFDM Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems via optimized sparsification of tone reservation (TR). In particular, we propose a novel TR optimization method in which the minimum number of effectively used peak-reserved tones (PRTs) required to satisfy a prescribed PAPR level is found, leaving the remaining PRTs free to be opportunistically utilized by other functionalities, such as joint communication and sensing (JCAS), index modulation (IM), cognitive radio (CR) and others. The proposed method relies on an l0 norm regularization approach to penalize the number of PRTs, leading to a problem convexized via fractional programming (FP), whose solution is shown to ensure that the prescribed PAPR is achieved with high probability with a smaller number of PRTs than state of the art (SotA) methods. The contribution can be seen as a mechanism to enable the opportunistic integration of adjacent functionalities into existing OFDM-based systems.</description>

      <title>SwinFi: a CSI Compression Method based on Swin Transformer for Wi-Fi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is a transformative approach that enables a large of applications through CSI analysis. The challenge lies in the high computational and communication costs with the increasing granularity of CSI data. In this letter, we propose SwinFi, a pioneering solution that compresses CSI at the edge into a succinct feature image and reconstructs at the cloud for further processing. SwinFi employs a Swin Transformer-based autoencoder-decoder architecture that ensures SOTA performance in both CSI reconstruction and sensing tasks. We utilize a dataset for PIR task and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate SwinFi. The results show that SwinFi achieves the reconstruction quality with the NMSE of -37.74dB and the classification accuracy of 95.3% at the same time.</description>

      <title>Joint Visibility Region Detection and Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems via Alternating MAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a joint visibility region (VR) detection and channel estimation problem in extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, where near-field propagation and spatial non-stationary effects exist. In this case, each scatterer can only see a subset of antennas, i.e., it has a certain VR over the antennas. Because of the spatial correlation among adjacent sub-arrays, VR of scatterers exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) clustered sparsity. We design a 2D Markov prior model to capture such a structured sparsity. Based on this, a novel alternating maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework is developed for high-accuracy VR detection and channel estimation. The alternating MAP framework consists of three basic modules: a channel estimation module, a VR detection module, and a grid update module. Specifically, the first module is a low-complexity inverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) algorithm that avoids the matrix inverse via minimizing a relaxed Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The second module is a structured expectation propagation (EP) algorithm which has the ability to deal with complicated prior information. And the third module refines polar-domain grid parameters via gradient ascent. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in both VR detection and channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Graph Normalized Sign Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and robust prediction of graph signals is challenging when the signals are under impulsive noise and have missing data. Exploiting graph signal processing (GSP) and leveraging the simplicity of the classical adaptive sign algorithm, we propose an adaptive algorithm on graphs named the Graph Normalized Sign (GNS). GNS approximated a normalization term into the update, therefore achieving faster convergence and lower error compared to previous adaptive GSP algorithms. In the task of the online prediction of multivariate temperature data under impulsive noise, GNS outputs fast and robust predictions.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-User RF Charging with Non-linear Energy Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology for sustainable support of massive Internet of Things (IoT). However, RF-WPT systems are characterized by low efficiency due to channel attenuation, which can be mitigated by precoders that adjust the transmission directivity. This work considers a multi-antenna RF-WPT system with multiple non-linear energy harvesting (EH) nodes with energy demands changing over discrete time slots. This leads to the charging scheduling problem, which involves choosing the precoders at each slot to minimize the total energy consumption and meet the EH requirements. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a solution relying on a low-complexity beamforming and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). The results show that the proposed beamforming achieves near-optimal performance with low computational complexity, and the DDPG-based approach converges with the number of episodes and reduces the system's power consumption, while the outage probability and the power consumption increase with the number of devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in AI usage demands innovative power reduction strategies. Novel Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures, leveraging advanced memory technologies, hold the potential for significantly lowering energy consumption by integrating storage with parallel Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs). This study addresses the 1T1R RRAM crossbar, a core component in numerous CIM architectures. We introduce an abstract model and a calibration methodology for estimating operational energy. Our tool condenses circuit-level behaviour into a few parameters, facilitating energy assessments for DNN workloads. Validation against low-level SPICE simulations demonstrates speedups of up to 1000x and energy estimations with errors below 1%.</description>

      <title>Realistic Channel and Delay Coefficient Generation for Dual Mobile Space-Ground Links - A Tutorial-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel and delay coefficient are two essential parameters for the characterization of a multipath propagation environment. It is crucial to generate realistic channel and delay coefficient in order to study the channel characteristics that involves signals propagating through environments with severe multipath effects. While many deterministic channel models, such as ray-tracing (RT), face challenges like high computational complexity, data requirements for geometrical information, and inapplicability for space-ground links, and nongeometry-based stochastic channel models (NGSCMs) might lack spatial consistency and offer lower accuracy, we present a scalable tutorial for the channel modeling of dual mobile space-ground links in urban areas, utilizing the Quasi Deterministic Radio Channel Generator (QuaDRiGa), which adopts a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM), in conjunction with an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) provided state duration model. This tutorial allows for the generation of realistic channel and delay coefficients in a multipath environment for dual mobile space-ground links. We validate the accuracy of the work by analyzing the generated channel and delay coefficient from several aspects, such as received signal power and amplitude, multipath delay distribution, delay spread and Doppler spectrum.</description>

      <title>FedSC: Provable Federated Self-supervised Learning with Spectral Contrastive Objective over Non-i.i.d. Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts have been made to integrate self-supervised learning (SSL) with the framework of federated learning (FL). One unique challenge of federated self-supervised learning (FedSSL) is that the global objective of FedSSL usually does not equal the weighted sum of local SSL objectives. Consequently, conventional approaches, such as federated averaging (FedAvg), fail to precisely minimize the FedSSL global objective, often resulting in suboptimal performance, especially when data is non-i.i.d.. To fill this gap, we propose a provable FedSSL algorithm, named FedSC, based on the spectral contrastive objective. In FedSC, clients share correlation matrices of data representations in addition to model weights periodically, which enables inter-client contrast of data samples in addition to intra-client contrast and contraction, resulting in improved quality of data representations. Differential privacy (DP) protection is deployed to control the additional privacy leakage on local datasets when correlation matrices are shared. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence and extra privacy leakage. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have a limitation of solely processing features on graph nodes, neglecting data on high-dimensional structures such as edges and triangles. Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect. Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.</description>

      <title>Effect of realistic oscillator phase noise on the performance of cell-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To keep supporting 6G requirements, the radio access infrastructure will increasingly densify. Cell-free (CF) networks offer extreme flexibility by coherently serving users with multiple Access points (APs). This paradigm requires precise and stable phase synchronization. In this article, we adapt the standardized 5G NR setup (subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol duration and allocation) to investigate the effect of Phase Noise (PN) on the simulated performance of scalable CF networks. In contrast to the prior literature relying on the simplified model of a free-running oscillator with the Wiener process, we deploy a realistic hardware-inspired phase noise model reproducing the Local Oscillator (LO) phase drift. Our results demonstrate that even affordable LOs offer sufficient stability to ensure negligible loss of uplink Spectral Efficiency (SE) on the time scale of the standardized 5G Transmission Time Interval of 1 ms. This study substantiates the feasibility of CF networks based on 5G standards.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Least Mean pth Power Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of impulsive noise, and missing observations, accurate online prediction of time-varying graph signals poses a crucial challenge in numerous application domains. We propose the Adaptive Least Mean $p^{th}$ Power Graph Neural Networks (LMP-GNN), a universal framework combining adaptive filter and graph neural network for online graph signal estimation. LMP-GNN retains the advantage of adaptive filtering in handling noise and missing observations as well as the online update capability. The incorporated graph neural network within the LMP-GNN can train and update filter parameters online instead of predefined filter parameters in previous methods, outputting more accurate prediction results. The adaptive update scheme of the LMP-GNN follows the solution of a $l_p$-norm optimization, rooting to the minimum dispersion criterion, and yields robust estimation results for time-varying graph signals under impulsive noise. A special case of LMP-GNN named the Sign-GNN is also provided and analyzed, Experiment results on two real-world datasets of temperature graph and traffic graph under four different noise distributions prove the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed LMP-GNN.</description>

      <title>Long-term usage of the off-grid photovoltaic system with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage system on high mountains: A case study in Payiun Lodge on Mt. Jade in Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy supply on high mountains remains an open issue since grid connection is unavailable. In the past, diesel generators with lead-acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) are applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESS is an appropriate method for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with Li-ion battery ESS has been installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operation for more than 7 years, the aging problem of the whole electric power system becomes a critical issue for long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows) and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system, such as daily operation patterns as well as C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions. The accomplished electric power improvement project dealing with the power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model between lead-acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, explaining that the expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with the cheap lead-acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study provides engineers and researchers a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models have enormous potential in advancing Earth and climate sciences, however, current approaches may not be optimal as they focus on a few basic features of a desirable Earth and climate foundation model. Crafting the ideal Earth foundation model, we define eleven features which would allow such a foundation model to be beneficial for any geoscientific downstream application in an environmental- and human-centric manner.We further shed light on the way forward to achieve the ideal model and to evaluate Earth foundation models. What comes after foundation models? Energy efficient adaptation, adversarial defenses, and interpretability are among the emerging directions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Simultaneous Localization and Multi-Lane Tracking Using Onboard Sensors and a SD Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-definition map with accurate lane-level information is crucial for autonomous driving, but the creation of these maps is a resource-intensive process. To this end, we present a cost-effective solution to create lane-level roadmaps using only the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and a camera on customer vehicles. Our proposed solution utilizes a prior standard-definition (SD) map, GNSS measurements, visual odometry, and lane marking edge detection points, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle's 6D pose, its position within a SD map, and also the 3D geometry of traffic lines. This is achieved using a Bayesian simultaneous localization and multi-object tracking filter, where the estimation of traffic lines is formulated as a multiple extended object tracking problem, solved using a trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (TPMBM) filter. In TPMBM filtering, traffic lines are modeled using B-spline trajectories, and each trajectory is parameterized by a sequence of control points. The proposed solution has been evaluated using experimental data collected by a test vehicle driving on highway. Preliminary results show that the traffic line estimates, overlaid on the satellite image, generally align with the lane markings up to some lateral offsets.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Algorithms for Out-of-System Interference Suppression in Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-system (OoS) interference is a potential limitation for distributed networks that operate in unlicensed spectrum or in a spectrum sharing scenario. The OoS interference differs from the in-system interference in that OoS signals and their associated channels (or even their statistics) are completely unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm that can mitigate OoS interference in the uplink and suppress the signal transmission in the OoS direction in the downlink. To estimate the OoS interference, each access point (AP), upon receiving an estimate of OoS interference from a previous AP, computes a better estimate of OoS interference by rotate-and-average using Procrustes method and forwards the estimates to the next AP. This process continues until the central processing unit (CPU) receives the final estimate. Our method has comparable performance to that of a fully centralized interference rejection combining algorithm and has much lower fronthaul load requirements.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Simultaneous Localization and Bias Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02814v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a factor graph formulation and particle-based sum-product algorithm for robust localization and tracking in multipath-prone environments. The proposed sequential algorithm jointly estimates the mobile agent's position together with a time-varying number of multipath components (MPCs). The MPCs are represented by "delay biases" corresponding to the offset between line-of-sight (LOS) component delay and the respective delays of all detectable MPCs. The delay biases of the MPCs capture the geometric features of the propagation environment with respect to the mobile agent. Therefore, they can provide position-related information contained in the MPCs without explicitly building a map of the environment. We demonstrate that the position-related information enables the algorithm to provide high-accuracy position estimates even in fully obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) situations. Using simulated and real measurements in different scenarios we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multipath-aided tracking algorithms and show that the performance of our algorithm constantly attains the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (P-CRLB). Furthermore, we demonstrate the implicit capability of the proposed method to identify unreliable measurements and, thus, to mitigate lost tracks.</description>

      <title>Propagation measurements and channel models in Indoor Environment at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper-mid band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New spectrum allocations in the 4--8 GHz FR1(C) and 7--24 GHz FR3 mid-band frequency spectrum are being considered for 5G/6G cellular deployments. This paper presents results from the world's first comprehensive indoor hotspot (InH) propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz in the NYU WIRELESS Research Center using a 1 GHz wideband channel sounder system over distances from 11 to 97 m in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS). Analysis of directional and omnidirectional path loss (PL) using the close-in free space 1 m reference distance model shows a familiar waveguiding effect in LOS with an omnidirectional path loss exponent (PLE) of 1.40 at 6.75 GHz and 1.32 at 16.95 GHz. Compared to mmWave frequencies, the directional NLOS PLEs are lower at FR3 and FR1(C), while omnidirectional NLOS PLEs are similar, suggesting better propagation distances at lower frequencies for links with omnidirectional antennas at both ends of the links, but also, importantly, showing that higher gain antennas will offer better coverage at higher frequencies when antenna apertures are kept same over all frequencies. Comparison of the omnidirectional and directional RMS delay spread (DS) at FR1(C) and FR3 with mmWave frequencies indicates a clear decrease with increasing frequency. The mean spatial lobe and omnidirectional RMS angular spread (AS) is found to be wider at 6.75 GHz compared to 16.95 GHz indicating more multipath components are found in the azimuthal spatial domain at lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Precision Enhancement in Sustained Visual Attention Training Platforms: Offline EEG Signal Analysis for Classifier Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a novel open-source brain-computer interface (BCI) platform was developed to decode scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with sustained attention. The EEG signal collection was conducted using a wireless headset during a sustained visual attention task, where participants were instructed to discriminate between composite images superimposed with scenes and faces, responding only to the relevant subcategory while ignoring the irrelevant ones. Seven volunteers participated in this experiment. The data collected were subjected to analyses through event-related potential (ERP), Hilbert Transform, and Wavelet Transform to extract temporal and spectral features. For each participant, utilizing its extracted features, personalized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models with tuned hyperparameters were developed. The models aimed to decode the participant's attentional state towards the face and scene stimuli. The SVM models achieved a higher average accuracy of 80\% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.86, while the RF models showed an average accuracy of 78\% and AUC of 0.8. This work suggests potential applications for the evaluation of visual attention and the development of closed-loop brainwave regulation systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Improving the Ranging Performance of Random ISAC Signals Through Pulse Shaping Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel pulse shaping design for single-carrier integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmission. Due to the communication information embedded in the ISAC signal, the resulting auto-correlation function (ACF) is determined by both the information-conveying random symbol sequence and the signaling pulse, where the former leads to random fluctuations in the sidelobes of the ACF, impairing the range estimation performance. To overcome this challenge, we first analyze the statistical characteristics of the random ACF under the symbol-wise pulse shaping (SWPS) regime. As a step further, we formulate an optimization problem to design ISAC pulse shaping filters, which minimizes the average integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) while meeting the Nyquist criterion, subject to power and bandwidth constraints. We then show that the problem can be recast as a convex quadratic program by expressing it in the frequency domain, which can be readily solved through standard tools. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pulse shaping design achieves substantial ranging sidelobe reduction compared to the celebrated root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping, given that the communication throughput is unchanged.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge algorithms specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</description>

      <title>Ternary Stochastic Geometry Theory for Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted UDN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, network topology becomes increasingly complex with the increased number of various network nodes, bringing in the challenge of network design and analysis. Most of the current studies are deduced based on the binary system stochastic geometry, overlooking the coupling and collaboration among nodes. This limitation makes it difficult to accurately analyze network systems, such as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted ultra-dense network (UDN). To address this issue, we propose a dual coordinate system analysis method, by using dual observation points and their established coordinates. The concept of a typical triangle that consists of a base station (BS), a RIS, and a user equipment (UE) is defined as the fundamental unit of analysis for ternary stochastic geometry. This triangle comprises the base station, the RIS, and the user equipment (UE). Furthermore, we extend Campbell's theorem and propose an approximate probability generating function for ternary stochastic geometry. Utilizing the theoretical framework of ternary stochastic geometry, we derive and analyze performance metrics of a RIS-assisted UDN system, such as coverage probability, area spectral efficiency, area energy efficiency, and energy coverage efficiency. Simulation results show that RIS can significantly enhance system performance, particularly for UEs with high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, exhibiting a phenomenon similar to the Matthew effect.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beam Training: Joint Angle and Range Estimation with DFT Codebook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11872v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works on near-field beam training have mostly assumed dedicated polar-domain codebook and on-grid range estimation, which, however, may suffer long training overhead and degraded estimation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper new and efficient beam training schemes with off-grid range estimation by using conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook. Specifically, we first analyze the received beam pattern at the user when far-field beamforming vectors are used for beam scanning, and show an interesting result that this beam pattern contains useful user angle and range information. Then, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly estimate the user angle and range with the DFT codebook. The first scheme estimates the user angle based on a defined angular support and resolves the user range by leveraging an approximated angular support width, while the second scheme estimates the user range by minimizing a power ratio mean square error (MSE) to improve the range estimation accuracy. Finally, numerical simulations show that our proposed schemes greatly reduce the near-field beam training overhead and improve the range estimation accuracy as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>RoboFiSense: Attention-Based Robotic Arm Activity Recognition with WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the current surge of interest in autonomous robotic systems, robot activity recognition within restricted indoor environments remains a formidable challenge. Conventional methods for detecting and recognizing robotic arms' activities often rely on vision-based or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, which require line-of-sight (LoS) access and may raise privacy concerns, for example, in nursing facilities. This research pioneers an innovative approach harnessing channel state information (CSI) measured from WiFi signals, subtly influenced by the activity of robotic arms. We developed an attention-based network to classify eight distinct activities performed by a Franka Emika robotic arm in different situations. Our proposed bidirectional vision transformer-concatenated (BiVTC) methodology aspires to predict robotic arm activities accurately, even when trained on activities with different velocities, all without dependency on external or internal sensors or visual aids. Considering the high dependency of CSI data on the environment motivated us to study the problem of sniffer location selection, by systematically changing the sniffer's location and collecting different sets of data. Finally, this paper also marks the first publication of the CSI data of eight distinct robotic arm activities, collectively referred to as RoboFiSense. This initiative aims to provide a benchmark dataset and baselines to the research community, fostering advancements in the field of robotics sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problems arising from the presence of Byzantine servers in a quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) setting. This is the first work to precisely define what the capabilities of Byzantine servers could be in a QPIR context. We show that quantum Byzantine servers have more capabilities than their classical counterparts due to the possibilities created by quantum encoding procedures. We focus on quantum Byzantine servers that can apply any reversible operation on their individual qudits. In this case, Byzantine servers can generate any error, i.e., this covers \emph{all} possible single qudit operations that can be applied by Byzantine servers on their qudits. We design a scheme based on cross-subspace alignment (CSA) and we show that this scheme achieves superdense coding gain in some cases.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Compression with Learned Heegard-Berger Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider lossy compression of an information source when decoder-only side information may be absent. This setup, also referred to as the Heegard-Berger or Kaspi problem, is a special case of robust distributed source coding. Building upon previous works on neural network-based distributed compressors developed for the decoder-only side information (Wyner-Ziv) case, we propose learning-based schemes that are amenable to the availability of side information. We find that our learned compressors mimic the achievability part of the Heegard-Berger theorem and yield interpretable results operating close to information-theoretic bounds. Depending on the availability of the side information, our neural compressors recover characteristics of the point-to-point (i.e., with no side information) and the Wyner-Ziv coding strategies that include binning in the source space, although no structure exploiting knowledge of the source and side information was imposed into the design.</description>

      <title>Static Grouping Strategy Design for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) extends conventional RIS through novel architectures, such as group-connected RIS, with scattering matrix not restricted to being diagonal. However, it remains unexplored how to optimally group the elements in group-connected RISs to maximize the performance while maintaining a low-complexity circuit. In this study, we propose and model BD-RIS with a static grouping strategy optimized based on the channel statistics. After formulating the corresponding problems, we design the grouping in single- and multi-user systems. Numerical results reveal the benefits of grouping optimization, i.e., up to 60% sum rate improvement, especially in highly correlated channels.</description>
