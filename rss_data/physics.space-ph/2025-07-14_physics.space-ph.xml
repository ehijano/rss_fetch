      <title>Magnetic properties of orphan penumbrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orphan penumbrae (OPU) are features resembling sunspot penumbrae, but are not connected to an umbra. Here we compare OPUs and sunspot penumbrae, including their filaments. We also identify and describe the main mechanisms for the formation of OPUs and we characterise their decay process. Our study is based on spectropolarimetric inversions of active regions observed with the Hinode spectropolarimeter. We manually identified 80 individual OPUs, allowing us to study them statistically. In addition, we analysed the time-evolution of selected OPUs using data provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Orphan penumbrae display a broad range of shapes, associated with typically $\Omega$-shaped magnetic field configurations, where opposite polarity fields predominate at the two ends of the OPU. In addition, the properties of the OPU filaments are remarkably uniform between different OPUs, resembling the ones in sunspot penumbrae. Most OPUs form by either a patch of a penumbra separating from a sunspot, or by new magnetic flux emerging close to the polarity inversion line of an active region. We observe chromospheric fibrils above almost all OPUs in Hinode H$\alpha$ images, indicating that a part of the magnetic field of the OPUs extends to the chromosphere. Our results show that OPU filaments can form given a broad range of boundary conditions for the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Universal energy limits of radiation belts in planetary and brown dwarf magnetospheric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.</description>

      <title>Plasma instability in the front of ejected energetic electrons and Type III solar radiobursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type III radio bursts are a signature of the flux of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It is traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the "time-of-flight" effect as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous, and gently varying solar-wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity-time profile of observed Type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.</description>

      <title>Granular jamming and rheology in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials behave in low gravity is crucial for planetary science and space exploration. It can also help us understand granular phenomena usually hidden by gravity. On Earth, gravity dominates granular behavior, but disentangling its role from intrinsic particle interactions is challenging. We present a series of compression and shear experiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our in-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing density and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that the jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on Earth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements further reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and predominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for granular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in enhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored granular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>
