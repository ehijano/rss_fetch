      <title>Quantum chromatic numbers of products of quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Cartesian, Categorical, and Lexicographic, and Strong products of quantum graphs. We provide bounds on the quantum chromatic number of these products in terms of the quantum chromatic number of the factors. To adequately describe bounds on the lexicographic product of quantum graphs, we provide a notion of a quantum $b$-fold chromatic number for quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>A tensor product for representations of the Cuntz algebra and of the R. Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors continue a series of articles studying certain unitary representations of the Richard Thompson groups $F,T,V$ called Pythagorean. They all extend to the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}$ and conversely all representations of $\mathcal{O}$ are of this form. Via this approach we introduce a tensor product for a large class of representations of $F,T,V,\mathcal{O}$. We prove that a sub-category forms a tensor category and perform a number of explicit computations of fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Minimal covers with continuity-preserving transfer operators for topological dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a non-invertible dynamical system with a transfer operator, we show there is a minimal cover with a transfer operator that preserves continuous functions. We also introduce an essential cover with even stronger continuity properties. For one-sided sofic subshifts, this generalizes the Krieger and Fischer covers, respectively. Our construction is functorial in the sense that certain equivariant maps between dynamical systems lift to equivariant maps between their covers, and these maps also satisfy better regularity properties. As applications, we identify finiteness conditions which ensure that the thermodynamic formalism is valid for the covers. This establishes the thermodynamic formalism for a large class of non-invertible dynamical systems, e.g. certain piecewise invertible maps. When applied to semi-\'etale groupoids, our minimal covers produce \'etale groupoids which are models for $C^*$-algebras constructed by Thomsen. The dynamical covers and groupoid covers are unified under the common framework of topological graphs.</description>

      <title>Remark on height functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field and $V(k)$ an $n$-dimensional projective variety over $k$. We use the $K$-theory of a $C^*$-algebra $A_V$ associated to $V(k)$ to define a height of points of $V(k)$. The corresponding counting function is calculated and we show that it coincides with the known formulas for $n=1$. As an application, it is proved that the set $V(k)$ is finite, whenever the sum of the odd Betti numbers of $V(k)$ exceeds $n+1$. Our construction depends on the $n$-dimensional Minkowski question-mark function studied by Panti and others.</description>

      <title>Strong almost finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14554v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable, bounded degree graph is almost finite if it has a tiling with isomorphic copies of finitely many F\o lner sets, and we call it strongly almost finite, if the tiling can be randomized so that the probability that a vertex is on the boundary of a tile is uniformly small. We give various equivalents for strong almost finiteness. In particular, we prove that Property A together with the F\o lner property is equivalent to strong almost finiteness. Using these characterizations, we show that graphs of subexponential growth and Schreier graphs of amenable groups are always strongly almost finite, generalizing the celebrated result of Downarowicz, Huczek and Zhang about amenable Cayley graphs, based on graph theoretic rather than group theoretic principles. We give various equivalents to Property A for graphs, and show that if a sequence of graphs of Property A (in a uniform sense) converges to a graph $G$ in the neighborhood distance (a purely combinatorial analogue of the classical Benjamini-Schramm distance), then their Laplacian spectra converge to the Laplacian spectrum of $G$ in the Hausdorff distance. We apply the previous theory to construct a new and rich class of classifiable $C^{\star}$-algebras. Namely, we show that for any minimal strong almost finite graph $G$ there are naturally associated simple, nuclear, stably finite $C^{\star}$-algebras that are classifiable by their Elliott invariants.</description>

      <title>Property (T) for Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study the notion of property $(\rm T)$ for Banach algebras, generalizing the one from $C^*$-algebras. For a second countable locally compact group $G$ and a given family of Banach spaces $\mathcal E$, we prove that our Banach algebraic property $(\rm{T}_{\mathcal E})$ of the symmetrized pseudofunction algebras $F^*_{\mathcal E}(G)$ characterizes the Banach property $(\rm{T}_{\mathcal E})$ of Bader, Furman, Gelander and Monod for groups. In case $G$ is a discrete group and $\mathcal E$ is the class of $L^p$-spaces for $1\leq p &lt; \infty$, we also achieve the analogue characterization using the symmetrized $p$-pseudofunction algebras $F^*_{\lambda_ p}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Topics in Algebra of Synchronous Games, Algebraic Graph Identities and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>
