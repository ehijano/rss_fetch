      <title>Cluster-based machine learning potentials to describe disordered metal-organic frameworks up to the mesoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly interesting and tunable materials. By incorporating spatial defects into their atomic structure, MOFs can be finetuned to exhibit precise chemical functionalities, extending their applicability in various technological fields. Defect engineering requires a fundamental understanding of the nature of spatial disorder and consequent changes in material properties, which is currently lacking. We introduce the cluster-based learning methodology, enabling the development of state-of-the-art machine learning potentials (MLPs) from defective systems at any length scale. Our method identifies atomic interactions in bulk structures and extracts local environments as finite molecular fragments to augment the model's training data where needed. We show that cluster-based learning delivers MLPs capable of accurately describing spatial defects in mesoscopic systems with over twenty thousand atoms. Afterwards, we select our best model to investigate some major mechanical properties of spatially disordered UiO-66-derived structures, elucidating the influence of defect concentration and composition on material behaviour. Our analysis includes large supercell structures, demonstrating that (near-) ab initio accuracy is within reach at the mesoscale.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Field Suppression of Morin Transition Temperature in Epitaxially Grown Hematite Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have demonstrated the existence of the Morin transition in epitaxially grown hematite thin films exceeding a critical thickness. The Morin transition temperature can be suppressed by magnetic fields applied both parallel and perpendicular to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) vector, exhibiting a distinct anisotropic behavior that is consistent with bulk hematite crystals. Detailed analysis explains the anisotropic behavior and provides a method for determining the DM strength, which remains nearly constant across the sample thickness over four orders of magnitude. Our findings obtained with transport measurements offer a valuable approach for studying antiferromagnetic spin configurations in thin films and nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Reactivity in Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots: Charge-Density Asymmetry and Hydrodesulfurization Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale materials that exhibit unique electronic and optical properties due to quantum confinement effects, making them highly relevant for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and energy conversion. While transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) QDs have been extensively studied in their pristine forms, Janus-type TMD QDs -- featuring compositional asymmetry across their atomic layers -- offer an additional degree of tunability through charge-density gradients and curvature effects, yet remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the electronic and structural properties of Janus TMD QDs composed of molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W) in combination with chalcogen elements (S, Se, Te) and oxygen, exploring three distinct structural classes: pristine, non-oxidized Janus, and oxidized Janus phases. Using first-principles calculations, including static DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we analyze curvature evolution, electrostatic potential isosurfaces, charge-density asymmetry, and surface formation energies to assess size- and composition-dependent stability. Our findings reveal that oxidation induces significant curvature and charge localization, particularly in W-based systems, enhancing their potential as catalysts for hydrodesulfurization reactions. Additionally, we identify size- and geometry-dependent stability trends, with larger and beta-type QDs exhibiting superior thermodynamic and thermal robustness. These results provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the design and synthesis of structurally tunable Janus QDs with tailored properties for catalytic and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient protocols for high-throughput first-principles materials simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in theoretical and algorithmic approaches, workflow engines, and an ever-increasing computational power have enabled a novel paradigm for materials discovery through first-principles high-throughput simulations. A major challenge in these efforts is to automate the selection of parameters used by simulation codes to deliver numerical precision and computational efficiency. Here, we propose a rigorous methodology to assess the quality of self-consistent DFT calculations with respect to smearing and $k$-point sampling across a wide range of crystalline materials. For this goal, we develop criteria to reliably estimate average errors on total energies, forces, and other properties as a function of the desired computational efficiency, while consistently controlling $k$-point sampling errors. The present results provide automated protocols (named standard solid-state protocols or SSSP) for selecting optimized parameters based on different choices of precision and efficiency tradeoffs. These are available through open-source tools that range from interactive input generators for DFT codes to high-throughput workflows.</description>

      <title>SymPlex Plots for Visualizing Properties in High-Dimensional Alloy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most conventional alloys have one or two principal elements with additional elements at lower concentrations. In contrast, multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs) offer a new paradigm for alloy design. Optimizing these alloys with many components and phases requires exploring high-dimensional spaces. Traditional visualization tools, such as phase diagrams and convex hulls require plotting dimensions that scale with the number of components, making them unsuitable for MPEAs with four or more elements. Here, we introduce SymPlex plots to enable the visualization of various properties along special paths in high-dimensional compositional spaces. These are radial heatmaps that plot the variation in properties along high-symmetry paths radiating from the parent equimolar MPEA to a set of chosen compositions such as the constituent elements and lower order alloys. SymPlex plots of thermodynamic potentials capture the changes in the energy landscape along the special paths and help visualize the effect of addition or substitution of components on the alloy stability. SymPlex plots of alloy properties, such as density or elastic modulus, help select compositions for targeted applications. By showing connections between compositions and properties in the high-dimensional space with more information concentrated near the equimolar region-as opposed to the corners and edges of the composition space that are more relevant for traditional alloys-SymPlex plots can help guide MPEA design.</description>

      <title>Electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional flat band triphosphides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use first-principles density-functional theory (DFT)
  calculations combined with the maximally localized Wannier function
  tight binding Hamiltonian (MLWF-TB) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)
  formalism to investigate quasi-particle effects in 2D electronic and
  optical properties of triphosphide based two-dimensional materials
  XP$_3$ (X = Ga, Ge, As; In, Sn, Sb; Tl, Pb and Bi). We find that with
  exception of InP$_3$, all structures have indirect band gap. A
  noticeable feature is the appearance of flat valence bands associated
  to phosphorous atoms, mainly in InP$_3$ and GaP$_3$ structures. Furthermore,
  AIMD calculations show that 2D-XP$_3$ is stable at room temperature,
  with exception of TlP$_3$ monolayer, which shows a strong distortion
  yielding to a phase separation of the P and Tl layers. Finally, we show that
  monolayered XP$_3$ exhibits optical absorption with strong excitonic
  effects, thus revealing exciting features of these monolayered
  materials.</description>

      <title>Automated Polarization Rotation for Multi-Axis Rotational-Anisotropy Second Harmonic Generation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation (RA-SHG) is a nonlinear optical technique used to probe the symmetry of condensed matter systems. Measuring the dependence of the SHG susceptibility on one or more external parameters, notably strain, field, temperature, or time delay, is an extremely powerful way to probe complex phases of quantum materials. Experimentally, extracting maximal information about the SHG susceptibility tensor requires measurements of S and P polarized input and output combinations, which naturally involves the rotation of the polarizers during data collection. For multi-axis experiments, this has proved challenging since polarization rotation is typically done manually. Automating this process eliminates labor constraints, reduces uncertainty due to low-frequency noise, and expands the type of multi-axis datasets that can be collected; however, it is difficult due to geometrical constraints within the setup. In this work, we design and implement low-cost, high-fidelity automated polarization rotators for use in multi-axis RA-SHG. These polarization rotators utilize an electrical slip ring to transfer power to the rotating RA-SHG optical setup as well as a miniature stepper motor to perform the polarization rotation. We demonstrate this automated system in time-resolved RA-SHG measurements in the non-centrosymmetric semiconductor GaAs. For the multi-axis measurements described above, this automated system permits data averaging over longer periods, vastly expedites data collection, and expands the setup measurement capability. This ultimately opens new frontiers in probing quantum materials using multiple tunable external parameters.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Reviews Composition Dependent Thermal Stability in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit unpredictable properties in response to environmental stressors, due to several composition-dependent degradation mechanisms. In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (&gt;85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (&gt;75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Slide and Twist: Manipulating Polarization in Multilayer Hexagonal Boron-Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the world of across-layer sliding ferroelectricity in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and gallium nitride (hGaN), aiming to control out-of-plane polarization. By investigating the effects of sliding single or dual layers in various hBN stacking configurations, we uncover methods for reversing polarization with energy barriers between 5 and 30 meV/f.u., making these methods experimentally viable. Our results show that single-interface sliding is more energetically favorable, with lower barriers compared to multiple interfaces. Certain pathways reveal stable polarization plateaus, where polarization remains constant during specific sliding phases, promising robust polarization control. Moreover, rotated multilayer structures maintain consistent net out-of-plane polarization across different rotation angles. In trilayer ABT structures, rotating the top layer and sliding the bottom layer can reverse polarization, expanding device design possibilities. While the primary focus is on hBN, similar phenomena in hGaN suggest broader applicability for this class of polar materials. The identified energy barriers support the feasibility of fabricating devices based on these multilayer structures.</description>

      <title>Electronic Energy Scales of Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully first-principles approach for spin dynamics based on density functional perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the magnon wavefunction can be expressed by a set of electronic wavefunctions obtained from the decomposition of magnon density profile, enabling the direct calculation of magnonic quantities including Berry curvature and Chern number. As a concrete example, we show that monolayer CrI$_3$ can host topological magnons driven by spin-orbit coupling. Our model-free approach paves the way for the comprehensive studies of magnons in real materials.</description>

      <title>Impact of dislocation densities on the microscale strength of single-crystal strontium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in ceramics at room temperature are attracting increasing research interest. Dislocations may bring a new perspective for tuning physical and mechanical properties in advanced ceramics. Here, we investigate the dislocation density dependent micromechanical properties of single-crystal SrTiO3 by tuning the dislocation densities (from ~10 to the power of 10 per square meter up to ~10 to the power of 14 per square meter). Using micropillar compression tests, we find the samples exhibit a transition from brittle fracture (if no dislocation is present in the pillars) to plastic yield (with pre-engineered dislocations in the pillars). While within the regime of plastic deformation, the yield strength and plastic flow behavior exhibit a strong dependence on the dislocation density. The yield strength first decreases and then increases with the increase of dislocation densities. Detailed examination via post-mortem transmission electron microscopy reveals a complex evolution of dislocation structure, highlighting the critical role played by dislocations in regulating the brittle/ductile behavior in SrTiO3 at room temperature. Our findings shed new light on dislocation-mediated mechanical properties in ceramics and may provide designing guidelines for the prospective dislocation-based devices.</description>

      <title>Positive unidirectional anisotropy in Y3Fe5O12/Ir20Mn80 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the unidirectional anisotropy in bilayers made of the important ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and the room temperature antiferromagnet Ir20Mn80 (IrMn). Measurements of the magnetization hysteresis loop in a wide temperature range and ferromagnetic resonance at room temperature revealed an unconventional positive exchange bias (EB). For comparison, we also made FMR measurements in a Py/IrMn bilayer that led to a negative EB with amplitude nearly two orders of magnitude larger than in YIG/IrMn. The presence of the positive EB, in which the hysteresis loop shift occurs in the direction of the field applied during deposition of the films, is attributed to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the spins of the two layers at the interface. The small value of the EB field in YIG/IrMn can be attributed to a competition of the interactions between the spins of the two sublattices of antiferromagnetic IrMn and ferrimagnetic YIG produced by the interface roughness.</description>

Abstract: We show that moving dislocations generate giant effective local magnetic fields in a crystal lattice that can flip spins. Since massive creation of fast-moving dislocations is associated with a powerful elastic stress, this suggests a new mechanism of the magnetization reversal generated by laser or microwave beams or by electrically induced shear deformation.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectricity with metastable ferroelectric state from Kittel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have revisited the Kittel model that describes antiferroelectricity (AFE) in terms of two sublattices of spontaneous polarization and antiparallel couplings. By constructing the comprehensive phase diagram including the antiferroelectric, ferroelectric, and paraelectric phases in the parameter space, we identified a phase with antiferroelectric stable states and ferroelectric metastable states (ASFM) due to the weak coupling between sublattices. We found that the metastability of the ferroelectric phase leads to apparent remanent polarization, depending on the measurement timescale. This explains the observed ferroelectric behavior of orthorhombic hafnia, which is predicted to be an antiferroelctric materials.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N sputtered thin films on n-type Si bottom electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N thin films are grown on highly doped and plasma treated (100) n-type Si. We demonstrate ferroelectricity for x = &lt;0.01, 0.02, 0.06, 0.08, 0.13, and 0.17 where the n-type Si is both the substrate and bottom electrode. Polarization hysteresis reveals remanent polarization values between 130-140 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and coercive field values as low as 4 MV/cm at 1 Hz with low leakage. The highest re-sistivity and most saturating hysteresis occurs with B contents between x = 0.06 and 0.13. We also demonstrate the impact of substrate plasma treatment time on Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N crystallinity and switching. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectra reveal an amorphous 3.5 nm SiNx layer at the Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N interface post-plasma treatment and deposition. The first $\sim 5$ nm of Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N is crystallographically defective. Using the n-type Si substrate we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N thick-ness scaling to 25 nm via low frequency hysteresis and CV. Serving as the bottom electrode and sub-strate, the n-type Si enables a streamlined growth process for Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N for a wide range of Al$_{1-x}$B$_x$N compositions and layer thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Manipulating magnetization by orbital current from a light metal Ti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect, which does not rely on the spin-orbit coupling, has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for electrically manipulating magnetization in thin-film ferromagnets. Despite its potential, direct experimental observation of magnetization switching driven by orbital currents has been challenging, primarily because there is no direct exchange coupling between orbital angular momentum and local spin based magnetic moments. In this study, we present a compensated design to directly probe the contribution of orbital currents in the most promising light metal titanium (Ti), where symmetric layer structures allow zeroing out of the net spin current. By varying the thickness of the Ti layer in Ti(t)/Pt/Co/Pt/Co/Pt multilayers, we demonstrate the ability to control the magnetization switching polarity. We deduce the orbital charge conversion efficiency of the Ti layer to be approximately 0.17. These findings not only confirm the presence of the orbital Hall effect in Ti but also suggest that orbital currents may be promising candidates for developing energy-efficient magnetic devices with enhanced performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>TensorSymmetry: a package to get symmetry-adapted tensors disentangling spin-orbit coupling effect and establishing analytical relationship with magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry-constrained response tensors on transport, optical, and electromagnetic effects are of central importance in condensed matter physics because they can guide experimental detections and verify theoretical calculations. These tensors encompass various forms, including polar, axial, i-type (time-reversal even), and c-type (time-reversal odd) matrixes. The commonly used magnetic groups, however, fail to describe the phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect and cannot build the analytical relationship between magnetic orders with response tensors in magnetic materials. Developing approaches on these two aspects is quite demanding for theory and experiment. In this paper, we use the magnetic group, spin group, and extrinsic parameter method comprehensively to investigate the symmetry-constrained response tensors, then implement the above method in a platform called "TensorSymmetry". With the package, we can get the response tensors disentangling the effect free of SOC and establish the analytical relationship with magnetic order, which provides useful guidance for theoretical and experimental investigation for magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Coupled femto-excitons, free carriers and light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum matter generated by ultrafast laser light opens new pathways in fundamental condensed matter physics, as well as offering rich control possibilities in "tailoring matter by light". Here we explore the coupling between free carriers and excitons mediated by femtosecond scale laser pulses. Employing monolayer WSe$_2$ and an {\it ab-initio} treatment of pump-probe spectroscopy we find that, counter-intuitively, laser light resonant with the exciton can generate massive enhancement of the early time free carrier population. This exhibits complex dynamical correlation to the excitons, with an oscillatory coupling between free carrier population and exciton peak height that persists. Our results both unveil "femto-excitons" as possessing a rich femtosecond dynamics as well as, we argue, allowing tailoring of early time light-matter interaction via laser pulse design to control simultaneously excitonic and free carrier physics at ultrafast times.</description>

      <title>Topological Fermi-arc-like surface states in Kramers nodal line metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Kramers nodal line metals (KNLMs) and Kramers Weyl semimetals (KWSs) has significantly expanded the range of metallic topological materials to all noncentrosymmetric crystals. However, a key characteristic of this topology - the presence of topologically protected surface states in KNLMs - is not well understood. In this work, we use a model of a $C_{1v}$ KNLM with curved Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) to demonstrate that Fermi-arc-like surface states (FALSSs), which have a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological origin, appear on surfaces parallel to the mirror plane. These states connect two surface momenta, corresponding to the projections of two touching points on the Fermi surfaces. Notably, as achiral symmetries (mirrors and roto-inversions) are gradually broken, the KNLM transitions into a KWS, allowing the FALSSs to evolve continuously into the Fermi arc states of the KWS. We also explore the conditions under which FALSSs emerge in KNLMs with straight KNLs. Through bulk-boundary correspondence, we clarify the topological nature of KNLMs.</description>

      <title>PTST: A polar topological structure toolkit and database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric oxide superlattices with complex topological structures such as vortices, skyrmions, and flux closure domains have garnered significant attention due to their fascinating properties and potential applications. However, progress in this field is often impeded by challenges such as limited data-sharing mechanisms, redundant data generation efforts, high barriers between simulations and experiments, and the underutilization of existing datasets. To address these challenges, we have created the Polar Topological Structure Toolbox and Database(PTST). This community driven repository compiles both standard datasets from high throughput phase field simulations and user submitted nonstandard datasets. The PTST utilizes a Global Local Transformer (GL Transformer) to classify polarization states by dividing each sample into spatial sub blocks and extracting hierarchical features, resulting in ten distinct topological categories. Through the PTST web interface, users can easily retrieve polarization data based on specific parameters or by matching experimental images. Additionally, a Binary Phase Diagram Generator allows users to create strain and electric field phase diagrams within seconds. By providing ready-to-use configurations and integrated machine-learning workflows, PTST significantly reduces computational load, streamlines reproducible research, and promotes deeper insights into ferroelectric topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Strain-Enhanced Altermagnetism in Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite compounds exhibit enhanced octahedral distortions coupled with strong electronic correlations, providing a promising platform to explore and tune altermagnetic (AM) order. In this work, we investigate AM phases in Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$, a well-known perovskite that hosts antiferromagnetism coupled to structural degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is a Kramers antiferromagnet in its ground state. However, a N\'eel-type magnetic configuration reveals a P-2 d-wave AM, hosting orbital-selective altermagnetism analogous to Ca$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. We further explore the effects of biaxial strain on the stability between the antiferromagnetic ground state and the AM phase. Our results suggest that the AM phase becomes more stable than the AFM phase below -2\% compressive strain. Additionally, strain can either enhance or suppress AM bands, with enhancements reaching up to 9\% under tensile strain. To quantify the AM band splitting, we introduce the "Altermagnetic Merit Figure" and analyze the role of electronic localization, delocalization, and octahedral distortions in AM behavior and magnetic stability changes under strain.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Photonics with 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature dislocation plasticity in ceramics: Methods, Materials, and Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation-mediated plastic deformation in ceramic materials has sparked renewed research interest due to the technological potential of dislocations. Despite the long research history of dislocations as one-dimensional lattice defects in crystalline solids, the understanding of plastically deformable ceramics at room temperature seems lacking. The conventional view holds that ceramics are brittle, difficult to deform at room temperature and exhibit no dislocation plasticity except in small-scale testing such as nanoindentation and nano-micropillar compression. In this review, we attempt to gather the evidence and reports of room-temperature dislocation plasticity in ceramics beyond the nano-/microscale, with a focus on meso-macroscale plasticity. First, we present a mechanical deformation toolbox covering various experimental approaches for assessing the dislocation plasticity, with a focus on bulk plasticity. Second, we provide a materials toolbox listing 44 ceramic compounds that have been reported to exhibit dislocation plasticity at meso-/macroscale under ambient conditions. Finally, we discuss the mechanics of dislocations in ceramics, aiming to establish a foundation for predicting and discovering additional ceramics capable of room-temperature plastic deformation, thereby advancing the development of prospective dislocation-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switchable polar and magnetic orders by nonlinear light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An outstanding challenge in materials science and physics is the harnessing of light for switching charge order in e.g., ferroelectrics. Here we propose a mechanism through which electrons in ferroelectric bilayers excited with light cause ionic structural transitions. Using perturbation theory within a many-body formalism, we show that the ionic coupling is mediated by a resonant change in electronic occupation functions, ultimately governed by the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of the ground state. Furthermore, we show that such transitions are generally accompanied by multiferroic order switching. We demonstrate two examples of light-induced structural and polarization switching under this mechanism using first-principle calculations on bilayer CrI$_{3}$ and MoTe$_{2}$. We show that the two materials can switch between atomic stackings with a light intensity threshold of only 10-100 GW/cm$^2$, a value 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that required by direct light-ion coupling thanks to the superior efficiency of resonant light-electron coupling. Since such switching is fast, highly controllable, contactless, and reversible, it is promising for use in optically controlled nonvolatile memory, nanophotonics and polar electronics.</description>

      <title>Achieving Altermagnetism in Monolayer Holey Graphyne via Atomic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving altermagnetism (AM) in two-dimensional materials is crucial for advancing the development of novel spintronic devices. This study introduces an innovative strategy to realize AM in monolayer materials by adsorbing non-magnetic $sp$ impurity atoms to construct planar bridges. Using holey graphyne (HGY) as the research object, first-principles calculations reveal that B and S impurity atoms can modulate the local electronic structure and trigger a superexchange mechanism, inducing a collinear compensated antiferromagnetic ground state with pronounced altermagnetic properties. Among these, the B adsorption system exhibits the best magnetic performance, with a N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature reaching approximately 210 K. This work offers a flexible and effective strategy to achieve AM in single-atomic-layer materials and $p$-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Drastic softening of Pd nanoparticles induced by hydrogen cycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystalline faceted Pd nanoparticles attached to a sapphire substrate were fabricated employing the solid state dewetting method. The as-dewetted nanoparticles tested in compression exhibited all features of dislocation nucleation-controlled plasticity, including the size effect on strength and ultrahigh compressive strength reaching up to 11 GPa. Hydrogen cycling of as-dewetted Pd nanoparticles resulted in their drastic softening and in change of the deformation mode. This softening effect was correlated with the high density of glissile dislocations observed in the cycled particles. This work demonstrates that the nanomechanical behavior of hydride-forming metals can be manipulated by hydrogen cycling.</description>

Abstract: Owing high conductivity in microcrystalline thin-films, CsSnI3 perovskite is a promising semiconductor for thermoelectrics and optoelectronics. Rapid oxidation of thin-film and intrinsic lattice strain hinders stabilization of the device performance. Cation engineering of perovskite molecule was considered as an effective strategy to tailor the structural properties and suppress the degradation processes. However, molecular engineering demands a thorough analysis of defect behavior, as it can influence ionic motion, recombination dynamics, and capacitive effects. The effective implementation of CsSnI3 in energy conversion devices requires careful consideration of the specific properties of thin films electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, as well as electronic transients, and charge transport in the device structures. In this work, we performed a complex investigation for modified CsSnI3 through cation substitution with methyl ammonium (MA) and formamidinium (FA). Our findings highlight a complex interplay between electrical parameters of the bare thin films and stability of the devices (p-i-n diodes) after thermal stress. FA-CsSnI3 showed beneficial results for stabilization under elevated temperatures with improved non-ideality factor in diode structures, enhanced shunt properties and reduced trapping. The photo-induced voltage relaxation spectroscopy performed for MA-CsSnI3 showed relevant traps concentration of 1016 cm-3 with activation energy of 0.52 eV(210K) likely attributed to Sn atom defect. The obtained results are deeply analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Pyroelectric doping reversal of MoS2 p-n junctions on ferroelectric domain walls probed by photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring the optical properties and electronic doping in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a central strategy for developing innovative systems with tunable characteristics. In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Design of Interstitial Oxygen Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly efficient oxygen active materials that react with, absorb, and transport oxygen is essential for fuel cells, electrolyzers and related applications. While vacancy mediated oxygen ion conductors have long been the focus of research, they are limited by high migration barriers at intermediate temperatures, which hinder their practical applications. In contrast, interstitial oxygen conductors exhibit significantly lower migration barriers enabling faster ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. This review systematically examines both well established and recently identified families of interstitial oxygen ion conductors, focusing on how their unique structural motifs such as corner sharing polyhedral frameworks, isolated polyhedral, and cage like architectures, facilitate low migration barriers through interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion mechanisms. A central discussion of this review focuses on the evolution of design strategies, from targeted donor doping, element screening, and physical intuition descriptor material discovery, which leverage computational tools to explore vast chemical spaces in search of new interstitial conductors. The success of these strategies demonstrates that a significant, largely unexplored space remains for discovering high performing interstitial oxygen conductors. Crucial features enabling high performance interstitial oxygen diffusion include the availability of electrons for oxygen reduction and sufficient structural flexibility with accessible volume for interstitial accommodation. This review concludes with a forward looking perspective, proposing a knowledge driven methodology that integrates current understanding with data centric approaches to identify promising interstitial oxygen conductors outside traditional search paradigms.</description>

      <title>SLIDE: Automated Identification and Quantification of Grain Boundary Sliding and Opening in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain Boundary (GB) deformation mechanisms such as Sliding (GBS) and Opening (GBO) are prevalent in alloys at high homologous temperatures but are hard to capture quantitatively. We propose an automated procedure to quantify 3D GB deformations at the nanoscale, using a combination of precisely aligned Digital Image Correlation (DIC), electron backscatter diffraction, optical profilometry, and in-beam secondary electron maps. The framework, named Sliding identification by Local Integration of Displacements across Edges (SLIDE), (i) distinguishes GBS from GBO, (ii) computes the datapoint-wise measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor (from DIC), (iii) projects this data onto the theoretical GBS tensor to reject near-GB plasticity/elasticity/noise, and (iv) adds the out-of-plane step from optical profilometry to yield the local 3D GBS/GBO vector; automatically repeated for each $\sim$50nm-long GB segment. SLIDE is validated on a virtual experiment of discrete 3D sliding, and successfully applied to Zn-coated steel experiments, yielding quantitative GBS/GBO activity maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zintl-Klemm concept has long been used to explain and predict the bonding, and thereby the structures, of crystalline solid-state materials. We apply this concept to the amorphous state, examining as an example the diverse disordered Na-P phases that can form in sodium-ion battery anodes. Using first-principles simulations combined with state-of-the-art machine-learning methods, we provide atomic-scale insight into the structural and energetic behaviour of amorphous Na-P phases. We evaluate the applicability of the Zintl-Klemm rules in the amorphous state and discuss implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Fine tuning generative adversarial networks with universal force fields: application to two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid growth in use cases for generative artificial intelligence, its ability to design purpose built crystalline materials remains in a nascent phase. At the moment inverse design is generally accomplished by either constraining the training data set or producing a vast number of samples from a generator network and constraining the output via post-processing. We show that a general adversarial network trained to produce crystal structures from a latent space can be fine tuned through the introduction of advanced graph neural networks as discriminators, including a universal force field, to intrinsically bias the network towards generation of target materials. This is exemplified utilizing two-dimensional topological insulators as a sample target space. While a number of two-dimensional topological insulators have been predicted, the size of the band-gap, a measure of topological protection, remains a concern in most candidate compounds. The resulting generative network is shown to yield novel topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced scaling and criticality in martensites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales. However, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self organization towards criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of the fluctuations spectrum can be interpreted as an effect of inertia. The general insight is that inertial dynamics can become a crucial player when the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced criticality using an elementary example of mass points connected by bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in the fully realistic two and three dimensional continuum models of specific elastic phase transitions in crystals.</description>

      <title>Phonon properties and unconventional heat transfer in quasi-2D $Bi_2O_2Se$ crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se belongs to a group of quasi-2D semiconductors that can replace silicon in future high-speed/low-power electronics. However, the correlation between crystal/band structure and other physical properties still eludes understanding: carrier mobility increases non-intuitively with carrier concentration; the observed $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity lacks explanation. Moreover, a very high relative out-of-plane permittivity of about 150 has been reported in the literature. A proper explanation for such a high permittivity is still lacking. We have performed infrared (IR) reflectivity and Raman scattering experiments on a large perfect single crystal with defined mosaicity, carrier concentration and mobility. Five of the eight phonons allowed by factor group theory have been observed and their symmetries determined. The IR spectra show that the permittivity measured in the tetragonal plane is as high as ${\epsilon}_r{\approx}500$, and this high value is due to a strong polar phonon with a low frequency of ~34 $cm^{-1}$ (~1 THz). Such an unusually high permittivity allows the screening of charge defects, leading to the observation of high electron mobility at low temperatures. It also allows effective modulation doping providing a platform for high performance 2D electronics. DFT calculations suggest the existence of a very low frequency acoustic phonon ~14 $cm^{-1}$ (~0.4 THz). Both the low frequency phonons cause anomalous phonon DOS, which is reflected in the unconventional temperature dependence of the heat capacity, $c_M{\approx}T^{3.5}$. The temperature-dependent, two-component group velocity is proposed to explains the unusual temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity, ${\kappa}{\approx}T^{1.5}$</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potential can infer electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the response of material and chemical systems to electric fields remains a longstanding challenge. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer an efficient and scalable alternative to quantum mechanical methods but do not by themselves incorporate electrical response. Here, we show that polarization and Born effective charge (BEC) tensors can be directly extracted from long-range MLIPs within the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, solely by learning from energy and force data. Using this approach, we predict the infrared spectra of bulk water under zero or finite external electric fields, ionic conductivities of high-pressure superionic ice, and the phase transition and hysteresis in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ perovskite. This work thus extends the capability of MLIPs to predict electrical response--without training on charges or polarization or BECs--and enables accurate modeling of electric-field-driven processes in diverse systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Influence of pore-confined water on the thermal expansion of a zinc-based metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the reversible intercalation of guest molecules into metal-organic frameworks is crucial for advancing their design for practical applications. In this work, we explore the impact of H$_{\mathrm{2}}\!$O as a guest molecule on the thermal expansion of the zinc-based metal-organic framework GUT-2. Dehydration is achieved by thermal treatment of hydrated GUT-2. Rietveld refinement performed on temperature-dependent X-ray powder diffraction data confirms the reversible structural transformation. Additionally, it allows the determination of anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients for both phases. The hydrated form exhibits near-zero thermal expansion along the polymer chain direction, moderate expansion In the direction of predominantly hydrogen bonds, and the highest expansion in the direction with only Van der Waals bonding. Upon activation, the removal of H$_{\mathrm{2}}\!$O molecules triggers a doubling of the thermal expansion coefficient in the direction, where the hydrogen bonds have been removed. Regarding the dynamics of the process, thermal activation in air occurs within 6 hours at a temperature of 50{\deg}C and takes only 30 minutes when heating to 90{\deg}C. In contrast, full rehydration under standard lab conditions (30 % relative humidity) requires two days. During the activation/dehydration processes no change of the widths of the X-ray diffraction peaks is observed, which shows that the underlying crystal structures remains fully intact during the transition processes. Fitting the transformations by the Avrami equation reveals a quasi one-dimensional evolution of the dehydrated areas for the activation process and a more intricate, predominantly two-dimensional mechanism for the rehydration.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn$_5$Ge$_3$ originating in competing dipolar interaction and magnetocrystalline anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the anomalous and topological Hall effect of the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn$_5$Ge$_3$. We observe a significant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to nonzero Berry curvature in the momentum space, such that the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is 965 S/cm for the $xy$-plane and 233 S/cm for the $zx$-plane of the single crystal. The band structure calculations predict several Weyl and nodal points span across the momentum space, gapped out under the spin-orbit coupling effect, leading to significant $k$-space Berry curvature and large AHC. Experimentally, we also demonstrate a sizeable topological Hall effect that is originated by the non-coplanar chiral spin structure due to the competition between the out-of-plane uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the dipole-dipole interaction between two Mn sublattices. This study hints at the importance of dipole-dipole interactions in producing the skyrmion lattice in Mn$_5$Ge$_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>A greener process for poly-L-lactic acid production and chemical upcycling under mild conditions using highly active alkali-metal based catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-toxic potassium and sodium metal compounds have been prepared with a bulky aryloxide ligand MOR 1 y 2 as well, their counterparts containing a crown ether bonded to the alkali metal 3 y 4 and fully characterized. The activity of compounds 1 to 4 as catalysts for the ring-opening polymerization process of LLA have been studied, showing that they are extremely active and able to polymerize LLA within a few minutes under mild conditions, achieving PLLA with high molecular weight, similar to the commercial ones. For derivatives 3 and 4, the crown ether coordination to the alkali metal affects the nuclearity of the compounds and consequently its activity, giving a more controlled polymerization. As well the use of BnOH as co-initiator allowed a better control over the polymerization. Detailed studies of the polymerization mechanism have been performed, which confirmed an anionic mechanism in absence of a co-initiator. Furthermore, the nature of the mechanisms provokes the epimerization of the lactide and the existence of D-isomers in the PLLA. Since the percentage of d-isomer content in the polymeric chain as well as its distribution can strongly change the properties of PLLA a detailed analysis has been performed. As expected, the different isotacticity leads to a strong variation on the thermal properties. We have also compared the mechanical properties of the different synthetized PLLA, and we clearly observed that the epimerization reactions lead to an increase of the PLLA flexibility compared with commercial PLAs. Furthermore, the alkali metal compounds prepared not only polymerize, as well in the presence of an alcohol they can depolymerized PLLA within 15 min to give alkyl lactates, allowing the easy upcycling of commercial PLLAs.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging of graphene nanoribbons on graphene after polymer-free substrate transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-surface synthesis enables the fabrication of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with properties defined by their shape and edge topology. While this bottom-up approach provides unmatched control over electronic and structural characteristics, integrating GNRs into functional electronic devices requires their transfer from noble metal growth surfaces to technologically relevant substrates. However, such transfers often induce structural modifications, potentially degrading or eliminating GNRs' desired functionality - a process that remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to characterize 9-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) following polymer-free wet-transfer onto epitaxial graphene (EG) and quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene (QFEG) substrates. Our results reveal that armchair GNRs maintain their structural integrity post-transfer, while GNRs with extended or modified edge topologies exhibit significant structural changes, including partial disintegration. Additionally, STS measurements reveal differences in the Fermi level alignment between GNRs and the graphene substrates, a key factor in optimizing carrier injection efficiency in electronic transport devices. This study establishes a framework for detecting post-processing structural modifications in GNRs, which are often hidden in optical ensemble measurements.

      <title>Plasma-Treated Polymeric Biomaterials for Improved Surface and Cell Adhesion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface modification of polymeric biomaterials using plasma has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize the cell-material interface without compromising the structural properties of the material. This work presents a critical review of the impact of low-temperature plasma treatment on enhancing cell adhesion, with emphasis on the physicochemical changes induced on the surface of polymers commonly used in biomedical applications. The mechanisms of interaction between reactive plasma species and the polymer surface are analyzed, along with techniques used to introduce hydrophilic functional groups that improve wettability and biocompatibility. Scientific evidence demonstrates that this type of surface modification promotes greater cell spreading, anchorage, and proliferation, making it particularly useful in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and vascular prostheses. Finally, current and future trends in the development of smart plasma-functionalized biomaterials are discussed, highlighting their role in regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Batch Bayesian Optimization for High-Dimensional Experimental Design: Simulation and Visualization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks. To elucidate BO behavior in noisy and high-dimensional settings typical for materials science applications, we perform batch BO of two six-dimensional test functions: an Ackley function representing a needle-in-a-haystack problem and a Hartmann function representing a problem with a false maximum with a value close to the global maximum. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the evolution of optimization in high dimensions and evaluate how they are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function,and its exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape; therefore, prior knowledge of the domain structure and noise level is needed when designing BO. The Ackley function optimization is significantly degraded by noise with a complete loss of ground truth resemblance when noise equals 10 % of the maximum objective value. For the Hartmann function, even in the absence of noise, a significant fraction of the initial samplings identify the false maximum instead of the ground truth maximum as the optimum of the function; with increasing noise, BO remains effective, albeit with increasing probability of landing on the false maximum. This study systematically highlights the critical issues when setting up BO and choosing synthetic data to test experimental design. The results and methodology will facilitate wider utilization of BO in guiding experiments, specifically in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Structured Extraction of Process Structure Properties Relationships in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), the vast unstructured text within millions of academic papers is increasingly accessible for materials discovery, although significant challenges remain. While LLMs offer promising few- and zero-shot learning capabilities, particularly valuable in the materials domain where expert annotations are scarce, general-purpose LLMs often fail to address key materials-specific queries without further adaptation. To bridge this gap, fine-tuning LLMs on human-labeled data is essential for effective structured knowledge extraction. In this study, we introduce a novel annotation schema designed to extract generic process-structure-properties relationships from scientific literature. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a dataset of 128 abstracts, with annotations drawn from two distinct domains: high-temperature materials (Domain I) and uncertainty quantification in simulating materials microstructure (Domain II). Initially, we developed a conditional random field (CRF) model based on MatBERT, a domain-specific BERT variant, and evaluated its performance on Domain I. Subsequently, we compared this model with a fine-tuned LLM (GPT-4o from OpenAI) under identical conditions. Our results indicate that fine-tuning LLMs can significantly improve entity extraction performance over the BERT-CRF baseline on Domain I. However, when additional examples from Domain II were incorporated, the performance of the BERT-CRF model became comparable to that of the GPT-4o model. These findings underscore the potential of our schema for structured knowledge extraction and highlight the complementary strengths of both modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective band modifications in a charge-ordered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the charge order in kagome lattice materials has attracted great interest due to the unique electronic structure features connected to kagome networks and the interplay between electron and lattice degrees of freedom. Recently, compounds with composition $Ln$Nb$_6$Sn$_6$ ($Ln$ = Ce-Nd, Sm, Gd-Tm, Lu, Y) appear as a new family of kagome metals, structurally analogous to $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$ = Sc, Y, or rare earth) systems. Among them, LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ emerges as a novel material hosting charge density wave (CDW) with a $\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $\sqrt{3}$ $\times$ $3$ wave vector, akin to that in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Here, we employ high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the electronic properties of LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our observation reveals the characteristic band structures of the "166" kagome system. A charge instability driven by Fermi surface nesting is decisively ruled out through an analysis of the interactions between van Hove singularities. Across the CDW transition, we observe orbital-selective band modifications, with noticeable evolutions of Lu 5$d$ and Sn 5$p$ electrons, while Nb 4$d$ electrons exhibit minimal change, suggesting that the Lu and Sn sites other than the Nb kagome lattice play a key role in the formation of CDW. Our findings substantiate a universal lattice-driven CDW mechanism rather than a charge-instability-driven one in the "166" kagome compounds, making it a distinct material class compared to other charge-ordered kagome systems, such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) and FeGe.</description>

      <title>Plasma and Thermal Processing Leading to Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Trapped O2 at Europa and Ganymede</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe physical processes affecting the formation, trapping, and outgassing of molecular oxygen (O2) at Europa and Ganymede. Following Voyager measurements of their ambient plasmas, laboratory data indicated that the observed ions were supplied by and would in turn impact and sputtering their surfaces, decomposing the ice and producing thin O2 atmospheres. More than a decade later, Europa's ambient O2 was inferred from observations of the O aurora and condensed O2 bands at 5773 and 6275 angstroms were observed in Ganymede's icy surface. More than another decade later, the O2 atmosphere was shown to have a dusk/dawn enhancement, confirmed by Juno data. Although the incident plasma produces these observables, processes within the surface are still not well understood. Here we note that incident plasma produces a non-equilibrium defect density in the surface grains. Subsequent diffusion leads to the formation of voids and molecular products, some of which are volatile. Although some volatiles are released into their atmospheres, others are trapped at defects or in voids forming gas bubbles, which might be delivered to their subsurface oceans. Here we discuss how trapping competes with annealing of the radiation damage. We describe differences observed at Europa and Ganymede and roughly determine the trend with latitude of O2 bands on Ganymede's trailing hemisphere. This understanding is used to discuss the importance of condensed and adsorbed O2 as atmospheric sources, accounting for dusk/dawn enhancements and temporal variability reported in condensed O2 band depths. Since plasma and thermal annealing timescales affect the observed O2 variability on all of the icy moons, understanding the critical physical processes of O2 can help determine the evolution of other detected oxidants often suggested to be related to geological activity and venting.</description>

      <title>Spin-Torque-Driven Non-uniform Dynamics of an Antivortex Core in Truncated Astroid Shaped Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin textures that are not readily available in the domain structures of continuous magnetic thin films can be stabilized when patterned to micro/nano scales due to the dominant effect of dipolar magnetic interactions. Fabrication of such devices enables a thorough study of their RF dynamics excited by highly concentrated spin-polarized/pure-spin currents. For this purpose, in this study, we have employed a truncated astroid geometry to achieve stable magnetic antivortex core nucleation/annihilation which was detectable using the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) at various temperatures. Furthermore, by depositing a soft magnetic thin film (20 nm thick permalloy) capped with a heavy-metal 2nm Pt layer, we were able to probe the spin orbit torque induced excitations accompanied by self-torque due to half-antivortex cores reminiscent of an isolated-antivortex, yielding GHz frequency oscillations with high quality factors (~50000). The observed RF oscillations can be attributed to a non-uniform domain wall oscillation mode close to the stable-antivortex core nucleation site as seen in micromagnetic simulations. This fundamental study of antivortex core response to spin currents is crucial for the assessment of their potential applications in high frequency spintronic devices such as reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Ab initio screening for BCS-type superconductivity in ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we applied ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations to compounds with the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure to search for BCS superconductor candidates. From the 1883 compounds registered in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, we excluded those whose chemical compositions would inhibit the emergence of BCS-type superconductivity by giving rise to magnetism or heavy-fermionic behavior. We then focused on 66 compounds confirmed to be dynamically stable through phonon calculations. Among these, for the 24 systems with experimentally reported $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, we verified that the ab initio $T_\mathrm{c}$ calculations exhibit excellent predictive reliability. For the remaining 42 compounds lacking experimental $T_\mathrm{c}$ values, our predictions identified several new BCS-type superconductor candidates, including SrPb$_2$Al$_2$ $\left(T_c^\mathrm{calc}=2.2\,\mathrm{K}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Surface Dominated Quantum Geometry-Induced Nonlinear Transport in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the N\'eel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Raman spectroscopic evidence for linearly dispersed nodes and magnetic ordering in the topological semimetal V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are characterized by an electronic structure with linearly dispersed nodes and distinguished chirality, protected by broken inversion or time reversal symmetry. The intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ is proposed as a Weyl semimetal. In this study, we report polarization-resolved magnetic and electronic Raman scattering of this material, probing both the magnetic order and the electronic structure. The electronic scattering reveals a linear with frequency continuum of excitations, as the signature of electronic transitions within the proposed Weyl nodes in a two-dimensional electronic structure. Additionally, two-magnon excitations of V moments are observed near 15 meV in the magnetically ordered phase below 50 K. These excitations are well reproduced by calculations based on the Fleury-Loudon theory using spin wave exchange parameters derived from the neutron scattering data of this material and confirm the antiferromagnetic character of the order. These magnetic and electronic scattering, observed in the same spectra, provide independent spectroscopic evidence for a collinear antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state in V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Impact of Absorption due to Zero-Field Splitting on Loss in Dielectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence times of superconducting qubits are limited by loss mechanisms, whose microscopic origins have remained elusive. We propose a mechanism caused by transitions between zero-fieldsplit states of paramagnetic impurities or defects. We derive the absorption cross section for a magnetic dipole transition and apply it to calculate the loss tangent. For Cr, Fe, and V impurities in sapphire, we find loss tangents at 4.5 GHz in the range of 10$^{-9}$-10$^{-8}$, comparable to the loss measured in experiments. This value suggests that magnetic loss may be a limiting factor in the coherence times of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer microspherical resonators that trap light are crucial structures for on-chip and on-board integration in nanophotonic applications. Using advanced micromanipulation and thermo-welding methods, we successfully create welded polystyrene-based coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) with customized lengths, shapes, and optical characteristics. Through the thermal fusion of blue, green, and red fluorophore-doped polystyrene microspheres, multi-fluorescent cohesive units are created from dimeric to henicosameric periodic arrangements. Detailed micro-spectroscopy studies reveal CROWs' capability to support optical whispering-gallery modes. The periodic arrangements of different fluorophore-doped resonators within the CROW facilitate efficient guided transmission of light via both active and passive mechanisms in opposite directions. The welded structures exhibit mechanically driven rolling motion, confirming their integration as cohesive units. These findings highlight the versatility and performance of thermo-welded polymer microsphere-based waveguides, paving the way for scalable, low-cost photonic devices in sensing, modulation, and light guiding, emphasizing their role in future integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis model of grain-oriented ferromagnetic material using neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the behavior of grain-oriented (GO) ferromagnetic materials is crucial for modeling the electromagnetic devices. In this paper, neural operator models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO), U-net combined FNO (U-FNO) and Deep operator network (DeepONet) are used to approximate the dynamic hysteresis models of GO steel. Furthermore, two types of data augmentation strategies including cyclic rolling augmentation and Gaussian data augmentation (GDA) are implemented to enhance the learning ability of models. With the inclusion of these augmentation techniques, the optimized models account for not only the peak values of the magnetic flux density but also the effects of different frequencies and phase shifts. The accuracy of all models is assessed using the L2-norm of the test data and the mean relative error (MRE) of calculated core losses. Each model performs well in different scenarios, but FNO consistently achieves the best performance across all cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of local reciprocity in the interconversion between charge and orbital currents. By investigating orbital torque and orbital pumping in W/Ni bilayers, we show that the charge-orbital interconversion in the bulk of the W layer exhibits opposite signs in the direct and inverse processes -- the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects being positive and negative, respectively. This finding provides direct evidence of local non-reciprocity in the charge-orbital interconversion, in agreement with a theoretical prediction. These results highlight the unique characteristics of charge-orbital coupled transport and offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying orbital-current-driven phenomena.</description>

      <title>IEC-Independent Coupling Between Water Uptake and Ionic Conductivity in Anion-Conducting Polymer Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are promising candidates for replacing proton exchange membranes (PEMs) in electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, and osmotic energy extraction systems. However, optimizing the AEM design requires a deeper understanding of the ionic conduction mechanism in the hydrated polymer matrix. This study investigates this mechanism by seeking to understand the relationship between ion exchange capacity (IEC), water absorption, and ionic conductivity in polynorbornene-based thin films. We combine experimental measurements with computational simulations using a newly developed minimal model of the polymer film. Our model is able to reproduce key experimental observations, including water sorption isotherms and ion conduction behavior as a function of relative humidity, and successfully captures the relationship between them. By comparing experimental data with computational results, we explain the commonly reported correlation between conductivity and hydration level and show how the correlation between these variables is affected by the charge density and temperature of the material. Our research advances our understanding of the physical mechanisms that govern the performance of the polyelectrolyte membrane, which is essential for the development of more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Enhanced Out-of-Plane Spin Currents in NbIrTe$_4$ for Efficient Field-Free Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization</title>

Abstract: Efficient generation of out-of-plane (OOP) spin currents is crucial for advanced spintronic memory applications. However, the theoretical understanding and experimental implementation of robust OOP spin currents for high-density and low-power magnetization switching remain significant challenges of spintronics. Here, we demonstrate that transitioning NbIrTe$_4$ from a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator to a three-dimensional type-II Weyl semimetal markedly enhances OOP spin current generation. The bulk topological Weyl semimetal nature of NbIrTe$_4$, characterized by its Weyl cone, significantly enhances the OOP spin Berry curvature, enabling an unprecedented OOP spin Hall conductivity exceeding $10^5\hbar/2e$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1} $. This enhancement, surpassing the in-plane component by more than fourfold, enables efficient and field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of perpendicular magnetization with a low current density of 1.4 MA/cm$^2$. The improved spin Hall conductivity reduces the overall power consumption by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing systems, such as heavy metals. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of dimensionality in harnessing robust OOP spin currents in topological Weyl semimetals, paving the way for the development of high-density, low-power spintronic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Ionomeric extracellular matrices for dynamic soft robotic tissue engineering devices through protein sulfonation</title>

Abstract: Conventional tissue engineering methodologies frequently depend on pharmacological strategies to induce or expedite tissue repair. However, bioengineered strategies incorporating biophysical stimulation have emerged as promising alternatives. Electroactive materials facilitate the provision of controlled electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical stimuli, which support cell proliferation and tissue remodelling. Despite their ability to supply external electrical and mechanical stimuli to the tissue microenvironment, the electroactive polymers in use today often lack critical biochemical signals essential for native-like cell-cell and cell-scaffold interactions, thereby constraining their regenerative capabilities. To address the demand for biomimetic materials that possess enhanced capabilities in promoting cell and tissue stimulation, we present the development of a novel class of polymers called ionomeric extracellular matrices (iECMs). By utilising the linker-mediated conjugation of sulfonic acid biomolecules (taurine) to the backbone of an extracellular matrix protein (collagen), we illustrate the potential of iECMs as the first electromechanical actuating material platform derived entirely from ECM materials, paving the way for dynamic and soft-robotic platforms for a wide range of tissue engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of defect properties in concentrated solid solutions using a Langmuir-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alleged existence of sluggish diffusion in high entropy alloys has drawn controversy. In high entropy alloys, and in general in all solids, transport properties are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for defect concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl. We believe this is due to the high stability of disordered, random and ordered, intermetallic phases respectively in the CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl systems. This work provides future avenues to the prediction of thermal interstitials and vacancies in solid solutions, which is necessary for models of non-equilibrium behavior of solid solutions.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission. Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of this red-shifted state (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>The initial stages of silver fluorination: a scanning tunneling microscopy investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM) to characterize the early stages of silver fluorination. On Ag(100), we observe only one adsorbate species, which shows a bias-dependent STM topography. Notably, at negative bias voltages, $V_{\rm B}&lt;0$, the apparent shape can be described as a round protrusion surrounded by a moat-like depression (sombrero). As the voltage increases, the apparent shape changes, eventually evolving into a round depression. From the STM images, we determine the adsorption site to be the hollow position. On Ag(110) we find adsorbates with three distinct STM topographies. One type exhibits the same shape change with $V_{\rm B}$ as observed on Ag(100), that is, from a sombrero shape to a round depression as the voltage changes from negative to positive values; the other two types are observed as round depressions regardless of $V_{\rm B}$. From the STM images, we find the three adsorbates to be sitting on the short-bridge, hollow and top position on the Ag(110) surface, with a relative abundance of 60\%, 35\% and 5\%.</description>

      <title>The role of primary and secondary electrons in scanning transmission electron microscopy of hybrid perovskites: the CsPbBr$_{3}$ case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging has revolutionized materials science by offering detailed insights into the atomic structures of materials. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy rely on analysing backscattered and transmitted electrons as well as stimulated radiation emission to form structural and chemical maps. These signals contain information about the elastic and inelastic electron-scattering processes within the sample, including collective and single electron excitations such as plasmons, inter- and intraband transitions. In this study, ab initio and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the behaviour of high-energy primary and secondary electrons in scanning transmission experiments on CsPbBr$_3$ nanosamples. CsPbBr$_3$ is a perovskite material known for its high photoluminescence quantum yield, making it promising for applications in light-emitting devices and solar cells. This study explores and estimates the reflection and transmission of primary and secondary electrons based on their kinetic energy as well as sample thickness and work function. The spatial distribution and energy spectra of the secondary electrons are also examined and calculated to understand their generation depth and energy dynamics. These findings establish a theoretical framework for studying electron-material interactions and can aid in optimizing scanning microscopy techniques for imaging and characterizing advanced materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn$V^-$ formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn$V^-$ color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N$V$ and to other Group IV color centers. The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N$_\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$ charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\text{C}$ in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn$V^-$ in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetism and light can create abundant optical phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of an unconventional magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) stemming from vector spin chirality, denoted as chiral second-harmonic generation (SHG). Taking the antiferromagnetic (AFM) CrSBr bilayer as a prototype, we theoretically show that, via spin canting, the chiral SHG can be continuously tuned from zero to a value one order of magnitude larger than its intrinsic MSHG. Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the N\'eel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals. Our work not only uncovers a unique SHG with exceptional tunability but also promotes the applications of AFM optical devices and magnetoelectric detection techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the time-reversal-even (T-even) nonlinear Hall effect has been extensively discussed in nonmagnetic materials, the impact of magnetic phase transition on it remains largely overlooked. Here, we report an abrupt enhancement of the T-even nonlinear Hall effect in non-centrosymmetric SrRuO3(111) thin films during the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition. Scaling analysis reveals a sign reversal of both the skew scattering and side jump contributions upon the emergence of magnetism, which we attribute to the sign change of Berry curvature triple on the Fermi surface. Density functional theory calculations support this interpretation, ascribing this behavior to distinctive origins of Berry curvature hot spots in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. Our findings unveil the exchange-induced dramatic nonperturbative change of nonlinear Hall effect, and establish SrRuO3(111) thin films as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable nonlinear transport effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model of a polycrystalline alloy combining the Potts model for grain orientations with a lattice-gas model for solute thermodynamics and diffusion. The alloy evolution with this model is implemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with nonlinear transition barriers between microstates. The model is applied to investigate the long-standing question of whether grain boundary (GB) segregation of an appropriate solute can drive the GB free energy to zero, creating a fully stabilized polycrystalline state with a finite grain size. The model reproduces stable polycrystalline states under certain conditions, provided the solute-solute interactions are repulsive. The material's structure minimizing the total free energy is not static. It exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium between the competing processes of grain growth and grain refinement. The alloy eliminates triple junctions by forming a set of smaller grains embedded into a larger matrix grain. It is predicted that, if a fully stabilized nanocrystalline state is realized experimentally, it will look very different from the conventional (unstable) nanocrystalline materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI for Accelerated Metamaterial Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent -- a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents -- each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback -- our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</description>

Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 {\deg}C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. We estimate the long-range order parameter in stoichiometric ScTaN2 films to be 0.86, corresponding to a fraction of antisites of 7%. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x &lt; 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Volume Collapse and Metallization in Inverse Spinel Co$_2$TiO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic properties of inverse spinel $Co_2TiO_4$ (CTO-Sp) under high pressure (HP) conditions are systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At ambient conditions, CTO-Sp exhibits a cubic phase with a space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ and it undergoes two notable structural phase transitions at HP. The first transition, occurring at approximately 7.2 GPa, leads to the tetragonal-$I4_1/amd$ phase with minimal alteration in unit cell volume. Subsequently, a second transition to an orthorhombic phase with a mixed space group $Fddd$ and $Cmcm$ is observed around 17.3 GPa. This second structural transition corresponds to a first-order phase transition involving a significant reduction in unit cell volume of approximately 17.5$\%$. The bulk compressibility of CTO-Sp and its HP post-spinel phases is almost equal to the average polyhedral compressibility within each phase. The absence of Raman modes beyond 23 GPa is compelling evidence for metallization. DFT calculations reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by the collapse of local magnetic moments in the Cmcm orthorhombic phase, leading to the sample's pressure-induced metallization.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nickelate superconductors have attracted a great deal of attention over the past few decades due to their similar crystal and electronic structures with high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K under I4/mmm space group. The susceptibility measurements confirm bulk superconductivity with a volume fraction exceeding 80%. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one- and two-dimensional periodic tight-binding models under the presence of a potential that grows to infinity in one direction, hence preventing the particles to escape in this direction (the soft wall). We prove that a spectral flow appears in these corresponding edge models, as the wall is shifted. We identity this flow as a number of Bloch bands, and provide a lower bound for the number of edge states appearing in such models.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac-Pauli physics in lead-halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) relativistic corrections to bound states (ii) the Klein paradox, and (iii) spin effects in scattering. In particular, we demonstrate that (a) the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term, (b) strong spin-orbit coupling due to the Pauli term affects the exciton states, and (c) scattering of an electron off an energy barrier with broken mirror symmetry produces spin polarization in the outgoing current. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

      <title>Theory of excitonic order in kagome metals ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that kagome metals can feature an excitonic condensate of unconventional nature. Studying the recently discovered variants ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$ we identify electron and hole pockets due to a pair of van Hove singularities (vHS) close to the Fermi level, with an approximate spectral particle-hole symmetry. A significant fraction of the Fermi level density of states away from the vHS is removed by the onset of high temperature charge density wave order, and makes the bands more two-dimensional, setting the stage for the formation of excitons. We develop a two-orbital minimal tight-binding model of these materials which captures these features along with the sublattice support of the wavefunctions, and find $s$- or $d$-wave excitons depending on interaction parameters -- the latter of which exhibits either charge nematicity or time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) depending on strain, offering an explanation of recent STM and transport experiments. The presence of particle- and hole-type vHS, and the associated excitonic resonance, may be a common thread to understanding nematicity and TRSB in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Classification of Supercooled Liquids: Critical Cooling Rates and Entropic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DoPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DoPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DoPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature (T_x) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature (T_f). Near T_x, crystallization barrier-temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T_x, CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T_x, the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Silk: A promising natural blend of amino acids for efficient CO$_2$ capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various highly porous solid sorbents have drawn a significant research interest as promising carbon capture material. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO$_2$ adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO$_2$ capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO$_2$ adsorption capacity (~3.65 mmol CO$_2$/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO$_2$), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents and superior to all amino acid-based solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-fibroin aerogel is around 250 {\deg}C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 {\deg}C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintaining its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential, which is demanding further exploration.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</description>
