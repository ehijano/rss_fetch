      <title>High-efficiency fast pinching radiation of electron beams in nonuniform plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous development of bright x/gamma-ray sources has opened up new frontiers of science and advanced applications. Currently, there is still a lack of efficient approaches to produce gamma-rays with photon energies up to GeV and with high peak brilliance comparable to modern free-electron lasers. Here we report a novel mechanism called beam fast pinching radiation burst to generate such gamma-ray sources. It is achieved by injecting a GeV electron beam into a submillimeter plasma with an upramp density profile, enabling violent beam pinching to occur rapidly. During this process, a burst of collimated gamma-rays is efficiently produced with photon energy up to GeV, energy conversion efficiency exceeding $30\%$, and peak brilliance exceeding $10^{28}$ photons s$^{-1}$ mm$^{-2}$ mrad$^{-2}$ per $0.1\%$ bandwidth. All of these are several orders of magnitude higher than existing gamma-ray sources. This opens a novel avenue for the development of extremely bright gamma-ray sources for both fundamental research and cutting-edge applications.</description>

      <title>Cs-O$_2$-Li as enhanced NEA surface layer with increased lifetime for GaAs photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GaAs-based photocathodes are the only viable source capable of providing spin-polarized electrons for accelerator applications. This type of photocathode requires a thin surface layer, in order to achieve negative electron affinity (NEA) for efficient photo-emission. However, this layer is vulnerable to environmental and operational effects, leading to a decay of the quantum efficiency $\eta$ characterized by a decay constant or lifetime $\tau$. In order to increase $\tau$, additional agents can be introduced during the activation procedure to improve the chemical robustness of the surface layer. This paper presents the results of recent research on Li as enhancement agent for photocathode activation using Cs and O$_2$, forming Cs-O$_2$-Li as enhanced NEA layer. Measurements yielded an increase in lifetime by a factor of up to 19 $\pm$ 2 and an increase in extracted charge by a factor of up to 16.5 $\pm$ 2.4, without significant reduction of $\eta$. This performance is equal to or better than that reported for other enhanced NEA layers so far.</description>
