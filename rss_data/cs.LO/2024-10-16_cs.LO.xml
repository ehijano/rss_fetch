      <title>The Qualitative Collapse of Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an interpretation-preserving functor from a category of concurrent games to the category of Scott domains and Scott-continuous functions. We give a concrete description of this functor, extending earlier results on the relational collapse of game semantics. The crux is an intricate combinatorial lemma allowing us to synchronize states of strategies which reach the same resources, but with different multiplicity.
  Putting this together with the previously established relational collapse, this provides a new proof of the qualitative-quantitative correspondence first established by Ehrhard in his celebrated extensional collapse theorem. Whereas Ehrhard's proof is indirect and rests on an abstract realizability construction, our result gives a concrete, combinatorial description of the extraction of quantitative information from a qualitative model.</description>

      <title>Normalisation for Negative Free Logics without and with Definite Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves normalisation theorems for intuitionist and classical negative free logic, without and with the $\invertediota$ operator for definite descriptions. Rules specific to free logic give rise to new kinds of maximal formulas additional to those familiar from standard intuitionist and classical logic. When $\invertediota$ is added it must be ensured that reduction procedures involving replacements of parameters by terms do not introduce new maximal formulas of higher degree than the ones removed. The problem is solved by a rule that permits restricting these terms in the rules for $\forall$, $\exists$ and $\invertediota$ to parameters or constants. A restricted subformula property for deductions in systems without $\invertediota$ is considered. It is improved upon by an alternative formalisation of free logic building on an idea of Ja\'skowski's. In the classical system the rules for $\invertediota$ require treatment known from normalisation for classical logic with $\lor$ or $\exists$. The philosophical significance of the results is also indicated.</description>

      <title>Temporal Hyperproperties for Population Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperproperties are properties over sets of traces (or runs) of a system, as opposed to properties of just one trace. They were introduced in 2010 and have been much studied since, in particular via an extension of the temporal logic LTL called HyperLTL. Most verification efforts for HyperLTL are restricted to finite-state systems, usually defined as Kripke structures. In this paper we study hyperproperties for an important class of infinite-state systems. We consider population protocols, a popular distributed computing model in which arbitrarily many identical finite-state agents interact in pairs. Population protocols are a good candidate for studying hyperproperties because the main decidable verification problem, well-specification, is a hyperproperty. We first show that even for simple (monadic) formulas, HyperLTL verification for population protocols is undecidable. We then turn our attention to immediate observation population protocols, a simpler and well-studied subclass of population protocols. We show that verification of monadic HyperLTL formulas without the next operator is decidable in 2-EXPSPACE, but that all extensions make the problem undecidable.</description>

      <title>Complementation of Emerson-Lei Automata (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new constructions for complementing subclasses of Emerson-Lei automata using modifications of rank-based B\"uchi automata complementation. In particular, we propose a specialized rank-based construction for a Boolean combination of Inf acceptance conditions, which heavily relies on a novel way of a run DAG labelling enhancing the ranking functions with models of the acceptance condition. Moreover, we propose a technique for complementing generalized Rabin automata, which are structurally as concise as general Emerson-Lei automata (but can have a larger acceptance condition). The construction is modular in the sense that it combines a given complementation algorithm for a condition $\varphi$ in a way that the resulting procedure handles conditions of the form Fin ${} \land \varphi$. The proposed constructions give upper bounds that are exponentially better than the state of the art for some of the classes.</description>

Abstract: I am describing the square of opposition, in particular, and, Aristotelian Diagrams, in general. Then I describe how one can create a mathematical universe to host them. Based on this work, I introduce fuzzy Aristotelian Diagrams and describe a mathematical formulation of them. In addition, I outline the cdharacteristrics of a mathematical universe that can host them.</description>

      <title>Random expansions of trees with bounded height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequence $\mathbf{T} = (\mathcal{T}_n : n \in \mathbb{N}^+)$ of trees $\mathcal{T}_n$ where, for some $\Delta \in \mathbb{N}^+$ every $\mathcal{T}_n$ has height at most $\Delta$ and as $n \to \infty$ the minimal number of children of a nonleaf tends to infinity. We can view every tree as a (first-order) $\tau$-structure where $\tau$ is a signature with one binary relation symbol. For a fixed (arbitrary) finite and relational signature $\sigma \supseteq \tau$ we consider the set $\mathbf{W}_n$ of expansions of $\mathcal{T}_n$ to $\sigma$ and a probability distribution $\mathbb{P}_n$ on $\mathbf{W}_n$ which is determined by a (parametrized/lifted) Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) $\mathbb{G}$ which can use the information given by $\mathcal{T}_n$.
  The kind of PGM that we consider uses formulas of a many-valued logic that we call $PLA^*$ with truth values in the unit interval $[0, 1]$. We also use $PLA^*$ to express queries, or events, on $\mathbf{W}_n$. With this setup we prove that, under some assumptions on $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbb{G}$, and a (possibly quite complex) formula $\varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ of $PLA^*$, as $n \to \infty$, if $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ are vertices of the tree $\mathcal{T}_n$ then the value of $\varphi(a_1, \ldots, a_k)$ will, with high probability, be almost the same as the value of $\psi(a_1, \ldots, a_k)$, where $\psi(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ is a ``simple'' formula the value of which can always be computed quickly (without reference to $n$), and $\psi$ itself can be found by using only the information that defines $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbb{G}$ and $\varphi$. A corollary of this, subject to the same conditions, is a probabilistic convergence law for $PLA^*$-formulas.</description>

      <title>Herald: A Natural Language Annotated Lean 4 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifiable formal languages like Lean have profoundly impacted mathematical reasoning, particularly through the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated reasoning. A significant challenge in training LLMs for these formal languages is the lack of parallel datasets that align natural language with formal language proofs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel framework for translating the Mathlib4 corpus (a unified library of mathematics in formal language Lean 4) into natural language. Building upon this, we employ a dual augmentation strategy that combines tactic-based and informal-based approaches, leveraging the Lean-jixia system, a Lean 4 analyzer. We present the results of this pipeline on Mathlib4 as Herald (Hierarchy and Retrieval-based Translated Lean Dataset). We also propose the Herald Translator, which is fine-tuned on Herald. Herald translator achieves a 93.2% accuracy (Pass@128) on formalizing statements in the miniF2F-test and a 22.5% accuracy on our internal graduate-level textbook dataset, outperforming InternLM2-Math-Plus-7B (74.0% and 7.5%) and TheoremLlama (50.1% and 4.0%). Furthermore, we propose a section-level translation framework for real-world applications. As a direct application of Herald translator, we have successfully translated a template section in the Stack project, marking a notable progress in the automatic formalization of graduate-level mathematical literature. Our model, along with the datasets, will be open-sourced to the public soon.</description>

      <title>3D-Prover: Diversity Driven Theorem Proving With Determinantal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in automated formal reasoning is the intractable search space, which grows exponentially with the depth of the proof. This branching is caused by the large number of candidate proof tactics which can be applied to a given goal. Nonetheless, many of these tactics are semantically similar or lead to an execution error, wasting valuable resources in both cases. We address the problem of effectively pruning this search, using only synthetic data generated from previous proof attempts. We first demonstrate that it is possible to generate semantically aware tactic representations which capture the effect on the proving environment, likelihood of success and execution time. We then propose a novel filtering mechanism which leverages these representations to select semantically diverse and high quality tactics, using Determinantal Point Processes. Our approach, 3D-Prover, is designed to be general, and to augment any underlying tactic generator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Prover on the miniF2F-valid and miniF2F-test benchmarks by augmenting the ReProver LLM. We show that our approach leads to an increase in the overall proof rate, as well as a significant improvement in the tactic success rate, execution time and diversity.</description>

      <title>Logical Structure on Inverse Functor Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on the categorical semantics of dependent type theories, we investigate the following question: When is logical structure (crucially, dependent-product and subobject-classifier structure) induced from a category to categories of diagrams in it? Our work offers several answers, providing a variety of conditions on both the category itself and the indexing category of diagrams. Additionally, motivated by homotopical considerations, we investigate the case when the indexing category is equipped with a class of weak equivalences and study conditions under which the localization map induces a structure-preserving functor between presheaf categories.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for First-order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sandqvist gave a proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) for classical logic (CL) that explicates the meaning of the connectives without assuming bivalance. Later, he gave a semantics for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL). While soundness in both cases is proved through standard techniques, the proof completeness for CL is complex and somewhat obscure, but clear and simple for IPL. Makinson gave a simplified proof of completeness for classical propositional logic (CPL) by directly relating the the P-tS to the logic's extant truth-functional semantics. In this paper, we give an elementary, constructive, and native -- in the sense that it does not presuppose the model-theoretic interpretation of classical logic -- proof of completeness the P-tS of CL using the techniques applies for IPL. Simultaneously, we give a proof of soundness and completeness for first-order intuitionistic logic (IL).</description>

      <title>LEGO-like Small-Model Constructions for {\AA}qvist's Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {\AA}qvist's logics (E, F, F+(CM), and G) are among the best-known systems in the long tradition of preference-based approaches for modeling conditional obligation. While the general semantics of preference models align well with philosophical intuitions, more constructive characterizations are needed to assess computational complexity and facilitate automated deduction. Existing small model constructions from conditional logics (due to Friedman and Halpern) are applicable only to F+(CM) and G, while recently developed proof-theoretic characterizations leave unresolved the exact complexity of theoremhood in logic F. In this paper, we introduce alternative small model constructions assembled from elementary building blocks, applicable uniformly to all four {\AA}qvist's logics. Our constructions propose alternative semantical characterizations and imply co-NP-completeness of theoremhood. Furthermore, they can be naturally encoded in classical propositional logic for automated deduction.</description>

      <title>The Reachability Problem for Neural-Network Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A control system consists of a plant component and a controller which periodically computes a control input for the plant. We consider systems where the controller is implemented by a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations. The reachability problem asks, given a set of initial states, whether a set of target states can be reached. We show that this problem is undecidable even for trivial plants and fixed-depth neural networks with three inputs and outputs. We also show that the problem becomes semi-decidable when the plant as well as the input and target sets are given by automata over infinite words.</description>
