      <title>Tutorial for the growth and development of Myxococcus xanthus as a Model System at the Intersection of Biology and Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myxococcus xanthus is a unicellular organism whose cells possess the ability to move and communicate, leading to the emergence of complex collective properties and behaviours. This has made it an ideal model system to study the emergence of collective behaviours in interdisciplinary research efforts lying at the intersection of biology and physics, especially in the growing field of active matter research. Often, challenges arise when setting up reliable and reproducible culturing protocols. This tutorial provides a clear and comprehensive guide on the culture, growth, development, and experimental sample preparation of \textit{M. xanthus}. Additionally, it includes some representative examples of experiments that can be conducted using these samples, namely motility assays, fruiting body formation, predation, and elasticotaxis.</description>

      <title>Denoising Improves Cross-Scanner and Cross-Protocol Test-Retest Reproducibility of Higher-Order Diffusion Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clinical translation of diffusion MRI (dMRI)-derived quantitative contrasts hinges on robust reproducibility, minimizing both same-scanner and cross-scanner variability. This study evaluates the reproducibility of higher-order diffusion metrics (beyond conventional diffusion tensor imaging), at the voxel and region-of-interest levels on magnitude and complex-valued dMRI data, using denoising with and without harmonization. We compared same-scanner, cross-scanner, and cross-protocol variability for a multi-shell dMRI protocol in 20 subjects. We first evaluated the effectiveness of denoising strategies for both magnitude and complex data to mitigate noise-induced bias and variance, to improve dMRI parametric maps and reproducibility. We examined the impact of denoising under different analysis approaches, comparing voxel-wise and region of interest (ROI)-based methods. We also evaluated the role of denoising when harmonizing dMRI across scanners and protocols. DTI and DKI maps visually improve after MPPCA denoising, with noticeably fewer outliers in kurtosis maps. Denoising enhances voxel-wise reproducibility, with test-retest variability of kurtosis indices reduced from 15-20% to 5-10% after denoising. Complex dMRI denoising reduces the noise floor by up to 60%. In ROI-analyses, denoising also increased statistical power, with reduction in sample size requirements by up to 40% for detecting differences across populations. Combining denoising with linear-RISH harmonization, in voxel-wise assessments, improved intra-scanner intraclass correlation coefficients for FA from moderate to excellent repeatability over harmonization alone. The enhancement in data quality and precision due to denoising facilitates the broader application and acceptance of these advanced imaging techniques in both clinical practice and large-scale neuroimaging studies.</description>

      <title>Locomotion of Active Polymerlike Worms in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the locomotion of thin, living \textit{T.~Tubifex} worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of pillars with different spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially-driven polymer model.</description>

      <title>Morphing median fin enhances untethered bionic robotic tuna's linear acceleration and turning maneuverability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Median fins of fish-like swimmers play a crucial role in linear acceleration and maneuvering processes. However, few research focused on untethered robotic fish experiments. Imitating the behaviour of real tuna, we developed a free-swimming bionic tuna with a foldable dorsal fin. The erection of dorsal fin, at proper conditions, can reduce head heave by 50%, enhance linear acceleration by 15.7%, increase turning angular velocity by 32.78%, and turning radius decreasing by 33.13%. Conversely, erecting the dorsal fin increases the wetted surface area, resulting in decreased maximum speed and efficiency during steady swimming phase. This finding partially explains why tuna erect their median fins during maneuvers or acceleration and fold them afterward to reduce drag. In addition, we verified that folding the median fins after acceleration does not significantly affect locomotion efficiency. This study supports the application of morphing median fins in undulating underwater robots and helps to further understand the impact of median fins on fish locomotion.</description>

      <title>Cell shape and orientation control galvanotactic accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galvanotaxis is believed to be driven by the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and other molecules, referred to as "sensors", through electrophoresis and electroosmosis. Here, we update our previous model of the limits of galvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape and orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in principle possess more information about the electric field direction when their long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields maximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower variability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an alternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field direction by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional cue ("vector sum"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect not present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell elongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors migrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as is more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will elongate parallel to the field.</description>
