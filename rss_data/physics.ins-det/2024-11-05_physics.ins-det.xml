      <title>Beyond the EPICS: comprehensive Python IOC development with QueueIOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architectural deficiencies in EPICS lead to inefficiency in the development and application of EPICS input/output controllers (IOCs). An unintrusive solution is replacing EPICS IOCs with more maintainable and flexible Python IOCs, only reusing the Channel Access (CA) protocol of EPICS. After a digression about GUI development inspired by EPICS operator interfaces (OPIs), the structural similarity between standalone GUI backends, the Mamba backend, EPICS IOCs and other server programs is analysed. By combining the caproto library and event loops like those in these server programs, the QueueIOC framework for Python IOCs is created, which has the potential to systematically replace most EPICS IOCs currently used. Examples are first given for workalikes of StreamDevice and asyn; examples for seq-like applications include monochromators, motor anti-bumping and motor multiplexing. Also shown is software to use with the ~/iocBoot convention which addresses some issues with a similar solution based on procServ, along with a workalike of procServControl. A QueueIOC-based framework for detector integration, which overcomes areaDetector's limitations in performance and architecture, is presented in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <title>Detector integration at HEPS: a systematic, efficient and high-performance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least 25 kinds of detector-like devices need to be integrated in Phase I of the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), and the work needs to be carefully planned to maximise productivity with highly limited human resources. After a systematic analysis on the actual work involved in detector integration, a separation of concerns between collaborating groups of personnel is established to minimise the duplication of efforts. To facilitate software development for detector integration, the ADGenICam library, which abstracts repeated code in EPICS modules for cameras, is extended to support a much wider range of detectors. An increasingly considerable fraction of detectors, both inside and outside HEPS, offer performance that exceed capabilities of the areaDetector framework in EPICS. Given this background, areaDetector's limitations in performance and architecture are analysed, and a QueueIOC -based framework that overcomes these limitations is introduced. A simple, flexible ZeroMQ-based protocol is used for data transport in this framework, while RDMA transport and multi-node readout will be explored for higher data throughputs. By calling C/C++ libraries from within Python, the performance of the former and the expressiveness of the latter can coexist nicely; the expressiveness allows for much higher efficiency in the implementation and use of integration modules functionally comparable to their EPICS counterparts.</description>

      <title>A versatile framework for attitude tuning of beamlines at advanced light sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aside from regular beamline experiments at light sources, the preparation steps before these experiments are also worth systematic consideration in terms of automation; a representative category in these steps is attitude tuning, which typically appears in names like beam focusing, sample alignment etc. With the goal of saving time and manpower in both writing and using in mind, a Mamba-based attitude-tuning framework is created. It supports flexible input/output ports, easy integration of diverse evaluation functions, and free selection of optimisation algorithms; with the help from Mamba's infrastructure, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can also be readily integrated. The tuning of a polycapillary lens and of an X-ray emission spectrometer are given as examples for the general use of this framework, featuring powerful command-line interfaces (CLIs) and friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow comfortable human-in-the-loop control. The tuning of a Raman spectrometer demonstrates more specialised use of the framework with customised optimisation algorithms. With similar applications in mind, our framework is estimated to be capable of fulfilling a majority of attitude-tuning needs. Also reported is a virtual-beamline mechanism based on easily customisable simulated detectors and motors, which facilitates both testing for developers and training for users.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Muon Background Characterization for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the characterization of cosmogenic muon backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), located in the Edgar Experimental Mine (EEM) in Idaho Springs, Colorado. The CURIE facility at the EEM offers a versatile shallow underground environment, with accessible horizontal tunnel access and stable rock formations ideal for low-background physics experiments. We have measured the total underground muon flux in two locations, Site 0 and Site 1, yielding values of $\phi$ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.020$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.012$_{stat.}$ and 0.239 $\pm$ 0.025$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.010$_{stat.}$ $\mu\text{/}m^{2}\text{/}s$, respectively. We have utilized GEANT4 and PROPOSAL Monte Carlo simulations with Daemonflux and MUTE to model the muon flux at both sites, as well as an additional future location. We find good agreement between measurement and simulations, demonstrating the first instance of this computational framework being successfully used for depths $&lt;$ 1 km.w.e. The measured underground flux corresponds to a factor of 700 reduction compared to the sea level flux. Additionally, we present a new depth-intensity relationship to normalize the mountain overburden to an equivalent flat depth, enabling direct comparison with other underground facilities. We report an average equivalent vertical depth of 0.415 $\pm$ 0.027 km.w.e. Based on our measurements, this work highlights the facility's capability for hosting low-background experiments, addressing the demand for shallow underground research spaces.</description>

      <title>Removal of Radioactive Noble Gas Radon from Air by Ag-Zeolite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the removal of radon from purified and ambient airs by Ag-zeolite. Ag-zeolite is known to have very high performance for airborne radon removal. The dependence of zeolite type and silver content on the performance of radon removal was evaluated. The performance of radon removal by single pass and radon emanation were also evaluated. In addition, the adsorption performance due to zeolite solidification and the change in adsorption performance due to moisture in the gas were evaluated in order to investigate properties that should be considered for future practical use. These properties will be adaptable to the development of air purification systems for the large volume ultra-low radioactivity experiments.</description>

      <title>Transition Edge Sensors: Physics and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) are amongst the most sensitive cryogenic detectors and can be easily optimized for the detection of massive particles or photons ranging from X-rays all the way down to millimetre radiation. Furthermore, TESs exhibit unmatched energy resolution while being easily frequency domain multiplexed in arrays of several hundred pixels. Such great performance, along with rather simple and sturdy readout and amplification chains make TESs extremely compelling for applications in many fields of scientific endeavour. While the first part of this article is an in-depth discussion on the working principles of Transition Edge Sensors, the remainder of this review article focuses on the applications of Transition Edge Sensors in advanced scientific instrumentation serving as an accessible and thorough list of possible starting points for more comprehensive literature research.</description>

      <title>GPU performance in Run3 ALICE online/offline reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After several software and hardware upgrades during LS2, ALICE records 50 KHz of minimum bias Pb--Pb collisions in continuous readout mode. To cope with the high data rate of 3.5 TB/s from the detectors, multiple stages of compression are employed during data taking, the last one requiring full TPC tracking. This compression chain is part of the synchronous (online) processing and largely relies on GPU computing to reduce the data rate to 170 GB/s. After the data taking, a second phase called asynchronous (offline) processing is performed, where the compressed data are read and a full global reconstruction is performed, which results in the production of data that can be analysed. When the online computing farm is not fully utilized for online processing, it is capable of running the offline reconstruction leveraging GPUs, which proved to speed up also this phase. ALICE is making significant efforts to offload more of the asynchronous reconstruction to GPUs, to speed up the overall execution time and efficiently use as much GPU computing resources as possible. This talk will focus on the performance that GPUs have provided in Run 3 for the ALICE experiment, both for online and offline reconstruction. Moreover, it will also highlight the offloading process to GPU of the track-model decoding, an asynchronous reconstruction task which is one of the software routines that have been targeted to be offloaded to GPUs during offline reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity screening of materials for rare event searches by neutron activation at the TRIGA reactor of Pavia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of physics experiments searching for rare events, the selection of extremely radiopure materials is a challenging task, as the signal of interest is often hidden by instrumental background. Neutron activation is a powerful technique to measure trace contaminants with high sensitivity but, to be properly applied, it requires a good characterization of neutron irradiation and $\gamma$-spectroscopy facilities. This paper presents the state-of-the-art workflow adopted by the Radioactivity Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca for radiopurity screening of materials by neutron activation performed at the TRIGA reactor in Pavia. The ultimate sensitivity of the described workflow, in the absence of interfering activation products and without the application of radiochemical and/or active background rejection techniques, is $&lt;10^{-14}$ g/g for $^{40}$K, $&lt;10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{238}$U and of the order of $10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{232}$Th contaminations. Further details are here provided to address systematic uncertainties related to neutron irradiation that may bias results. To this aim, a dedicated neutron activation campaign was performed and the data were analyzed exploiting a Monte Carlo simulation model of the reactor and applying an unfolding technique to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the neutron flux in typical irradiation configurations. The results of this work provide a valuable benchmark for the application of neutron activation in future radiopurity screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>Autoencoders for At-Source Data Reduction and Anomaly Detection in High Energy Particle Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detectors in next-generation high-energy physics experiments face several daunting requirements: high data rates, damaging radiation exposure, and stringent constraints on power, space, and latency. To address these challenges, machine learning in readout electronics can be leveraged for smart detector designs, enabling intelligent inference and data reduction at-source. Autoencoders offer a variety of benefits for front-end readout; an on-sensor encoder can perform efficient lossy data compression while simultaneously providing a latent space representation that can be used for anomaly detection. Results are presented from low-latency and resource-efficient autoencoders for front-end data processing in a futuristic silicon pixel detector. Encoder-based data compression is found to preserve good performance of off-detector analysis while significantly reducing the off-detector data rate as compared to a similarly sized data filtering approach. Furthermore, the latent space information is found to be a useful discriminator in the context of real-time sensor defect monitoring. Together, these results highlight the multifaceted utility of autoencoder-based front-end readout schemes and motivate their consideration in future detector designs.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Microstructural Evolution in All-Solid-State Micro-Batteries through in situ Electrochemical TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-solid-state batteries hold great promise for electric vehicle applications due to their enhanced safety and higher energy density. However, further performance optimization requires a deeper understanding of their degradation mechanisms, particularly at the nanoscale. This study investigates the real-time degradation processes of an oxide-based all-solid-state micro-battery, using focused ion beam lamellae composed of LAGP as the solid electrolyte, LiFePO4 (LFP) composite as the positive electrode, and LiVPO4 (LVP) composite as the negative electrode. In situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed critical degradation phenomena, including the formation of cracks along grain boundaries in the solid electrolyte due to lithium diffusion and mechanical stress. Additionally, the shrinkage of solid electrolyte particles and the formation of amorphous phases were observed. These findings highlight the importance of grain boundary dynamics and amorphization in the performance of solid electrolytes and provide insights into degradation mechanisms that can inform the design of more durable all-solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network for High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using nearly 5.5 times fewer parameters. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN's efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN's potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical performance limitations and filter selection based on Fisher information of a computational photonic crystal spectrometer for trace-gas retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global climate change severely impacts our world, there is an increasing demand to monitor trace gases with a high spatial resolution and accuracy. At the same time, these instruments need to be compact in order have constellations for short revisit times. Here we present a new spectrometer instrument concept for trace gas detection, where photonic crystals filters replace traditional diffraction based optical elements. In this concept, 2D photonic crystal slabs with unique transmission profiles are bonded on a detector inside a regular telescope. As the instrument flies over the earth, different integrated intensities for each filter are measured for a single ground resolution element with a regular telescope. From this detector data, trace gas concentrations are retrieved. As an initial test case we focused on methane and carbon dioxide retrieval and estimated the performance of such an instrument. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for trace-gas retrieval for such a spectrometer using Fisher information and compare this with the achieved performance. We furthermore set up a framework how to select photonic crystal filters based on maximizing the Fisher information carried by the filters and how to use the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound to find good filter sets. The retrieval performance of such an instrument is found to be between 0.4% to 0.9% for methane and 0.2% to 0.5% for carbon dioxide detection for a 300x300 m2 ground resolution element and realistic instrument parameters.</description>

      <title>Development of a photonic crystal spectrometer for greenhouse gas measurements</title>

Abstract: The need of atmospheric information with a higher spatial and temporal resolution drives the development of small satellites and satellite constellations to complement satellite flagship missions. Since optical systems are a main contributor to the satellite size, these are the prime candidate for their miniaturization. We present here a novel optical system where the complete spectrometer part of the optical system is compressed in one flat optical element. The element consists of an array of photonic crystals which is directly placed on a detector. The photonic crystals act as optical filters with a tunable spectral transmission response. From the integrated optical signals per filter and the atmosphere model, greenhouse gas concentrations are obtained using computational inversion. We present in this article the instrument concept, the manufacturing and measurement of the photonic crystals, methods for the filter array optimization, and discuss the predicted retrieval performance for the detection of methane and carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of the HeRALD Superfluid Helium Detector Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SPICE/HeRALD collaboration is performing R&amp;D to enable studies of sub-GeV dark matter models using a variety of target materials. Here we report our recent progress on instrumenting a superfluid $^4$He target mass with a transition-edge sensor based calorimeter to detect both atomic signals (scintillation) and $^4$He quasiparticle (phonon and roton) excitations. The sensitivity of HeRALD to the critical "quantum evaporation" signal from $^4$He quasiparticles requires us to block the superfluid film flow to the calorimeter. We have developed a heat-free film-blocking method employing an unoxidized Cs film, which we implemented in a prototype "HeRALD v0.1" detector of ~10 g target mass. This article reports initial studies of the atomic and quasiparticle signal channels. A key result of this work is the measurement of the quantum evaporation channel's gain of 0.15 $\pm$ 0.01, which will enable $^4$He-based dark matter experiments in the near term. With this gain the HeRALD detector reported here has an energy threshold of 145 eV at 5 sigma, which would be sensitive to dark matter masses down to 220 MeV/c$^2$.</description>

      <title>Development of a real-time beam profile monitor for GeV photons and its application in accelerator facilities</title>

Abstract: A real-time beam profile monitoring system is proposed for GeV photon beams at the BM4 beamline of the Mikamine site, Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science (RARiS; previously known as ELPH) at Tohoku University. This monitoring system enhances the capability to monitor the entire beamline by incorporating newly developed beam profile monitors (BPMs) for upstream and midstream sections, in addition to the existing high-speed BPM used for downstream monitoring. This paper reports on the detection mechanisms of the newly developed BPMs and the actual measurement results obtained using the integrated beam monitoring system. The new BPMs are composed of plastic scintillation fibers and silicon photomultipliers, enabling high-precision, real-time measurements. Data acquisition utilizes streaming TDC, a firmware commonly employed in the J-PARC Hadron-hall, allowing real-time detection of high-intensity photon beams with count rates reaching several tens of MHz. With sufficient statistical data, the BPM achieved a 1-s beam-profiling accuracy of 10 {\mu}m. The proposed BPM system serves as a valuable resource for future physics experiments at the BM4 photon beamline and will significantly contribute to ongoing accelerator research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the light yield of He:CF$_4$ based gaseous detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment aims to build a large ($\mathcal{O}(10)$ m$^3$) directional detector for rare event searches, such as nuclear recoils (NRs) induced by dark matter (DM), such as weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs). The detector concept comprises a time projection chamber (TPC), filled with a He:CF$_4$ 60/40 scintillating gas mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, equipped with an amplification stage made of a stack of three gas electron multipliers (GEMs) which are coupled to an optical readout. The latter consists in scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras and photomultipliers tubes (PMTs). The maximisation of the light yield of the amplification stage plays a major role in the determination of the energy threshold of the experiment. In this paper, we simulate the effect of the addition of a strong electric field below the last GEM plane on the GEM field structure and we experimentally test it by means of a 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ readout area prototype. The experimental measurements analyse stacks of different GEMs and helium concentrations in the gas mixture combined with this extra electric field, studying their performances in terms of light yield, energy resolution and intrinsic diffusion. It is found that the use of this additional electric field permits large light yield increases without degrading intrinsic characteristics of the amplification stage with respect to the regular use of GEMs.</description>

      <title>Improvement and Characterisation of the ArCLight Large-Area Dielectric Light Detector for Liquid-Argon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of scintillation light in noble-liquid detectors is necessary for identifying neutrino interaction candidates from beam, astrophysical, or solar sources. Large monolithic detectors typically have highly efficient light sensors, like photomultipliers, mounted outside their electric field. This option is not available for modular detectors that wish to maximize their active volume. The ArgonCube light readout system detectors (ArCLights) are large-area thin-wavelength-shifting (WLS) panels that can operate in highly proximate modular detectors and within the electric field. The WLS plastic forming the bulk structure of the ArCLight has Tetraphenyl Butadiene (TPB) and sheets of dichroic mirror layered across its surface. It is coupled to a set of six silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). This publication compares TPB coating techniques for large surface areas and describes quality control methods for large-scale production.</description>

      <title>TCAD Parameters for 4H-SiC: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>
