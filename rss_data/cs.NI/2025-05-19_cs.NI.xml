      <title>mmMirror: Device Free mmWave Indoor NLoS Localization Using Van-Atta-Array IRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 is transforming manufacturing and logistics by integrating robots into shared human environments, such as factories, warehouses, and healthcare facilities. However, the risk of human-robot collisions, especially in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios like around corners, remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions, such as vision-based and LiDAR systems, often fail under occlusion, lighting constraints, or privacy concerns, while RF-based systems are limited by range and accuracy.
  To address these limitations, we propose mmMirror, a novel system leveraging a Van Atta Array-based millimeter-wave (mmWave) reconfigurable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for precise, device-free NLoS localization. mmMirror integrates seamlessly with existing frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars and offers: (i) robust NLoS localization with centimeter-level accuracy at ranges up to 3 m, (ii) seamless uplink and downlink communication between radar and IRS, (iii) support for multi-radar and multi-target scenarios via dynamic beam steering, and (iv) reduced scanning latency through adaptive time slot allocation. Implemented using commodity 24 GHz radars and a PCB-based IRS prototype, mmMirror demonstrates its potential in enabling safe human-robot interactions in dynamic and complex environments.</description>

      <title>MM-INT: Telemetry in Programmable Switches with Multiple Queues using Source-based Multipath Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article emphasizes the importance of queues associated with the ports of switches in network monitoring. Traditionally, data collection about these queues is done using programmable data planes and telemetry based on INT (In-band Network Telemetry) probes, assuming there is only a single queue per output port. The MM-INT (Multiqueue Multicast - INT)
  is a solution that utilizes registers to store data from all queues and ports, enabling the efficient collection of monitoring information. The MM-INT avoids probe overload and employs the origin-based routing mechanism and multicast trees for the probes. The results demonstrate significant reductions in the number of probes sent compared to other traditional solutions found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Palladium: A DPU-enabled Multi-Tenant Serverless Cloud over Zero-copy Multi-node RDMA Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless computing promises enhanced resource efficiency and lower user costs, yet is burdened by a heavyweight, CPU-bound data plane. Prior efforts exploiting shared memory reduce overhead locally but fall short when scaling across nodes. Furthermore, serverless environments can have unpredictable and large-scale multi-tenancy, leading to contention for shared network resources.
  We present Palladium, a DPU-centric serverless data plane that reduces the CPU burden and enables efficient, zero-copy communication in multi-tenant serverless clouds. Despite the limited general-purpose processing capability of the DPU cores, Palladium strategically exploits the DPU's potential by (1) offloading data transmission to high-performance NIC cores via RDMA, combined with intra-node shared memory to eliminate data copies across nodes, and (2) enabling cross-processor (CPU-DPU) shared memory to eliminate redundant data movement, which overwhelms wimpy DPU cores. At the core of Palladium is the DPU-enabled network engine (DNE) -- a lightweight reverse proxy that isolates RDMA resources from tenant functions, orchestrates inter-node RDMA flows, and enforces fairness under contention.
  To further reduce CPU involvement, Palladium performs early HTTP/TCP-to-RDMA transport conversion at the cloud ingress, bridging the protocol mismatch before client traffic enters the RDMA fabric, thus avoiding costly protocol translation along the critical path. We show that careful selection of RDMA primitives (i.e., two-sided instead of one-sided) significantly affects the zero-copy data plane.
  Our preliminary experimental results show that enabling DPU offloading in Palladium improves RPS by 20.9x. The latency is reduced by a factor of 21x in the best case, all the while saving up to 7 CPU cores, and only consuming two wimpy DPU cores.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.</description>

      <title>Approximation-First Timeseries Monitoring Query At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timeseries monitoring systems such as Prometheus play a crucial role in gaining observability of the underlying system components. These systems collect timeseries metrics from various system components and perform monitoring queries over periodic window-based aggregations (i.e., rule queries). However, despite wide adoption, the operational costs and query latency of rule queries remain high. In this paper, we identify major bottlenecks associated with repeated data scans and query computations concerning window overlaps in rule queries, and present PromSketch, an approximation-first query framework as intermediate caches for monitoring systems. It enables low operational costs and query latency, by combining approximate window-based query frameworks and sketch-based precomputation. PromSketch is implemented as a standalone module that can be integrated into Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, covering 70% of Prometheus' aggregation over time queries. Our evaluation shows that PromSketch achieves up to a two orders of magnitude reduction in query latency over Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, while lowering operational dollar costs of query processing by two orders of magnitude compared to Prometheus and by at least 4x compared to VictoriaMetrics with at most 5% average errors across statistics.

      <title>Agent Name Service (ANS): A Universal Directory for Secure AI Agent Discovery and Interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure discovery. This paper introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a novel architecture based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent discovery framework. ANS provides a protocol-agnostic registry infrastructure that leverages Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for verifiable agent identity and trust. The architecture features several key innovations: a formalized agent registration and renewal mechanism for lifecycle management; DNS-inspired naming conventions with capability-aware resolution; a modular Protocol Adapter Layer supporting diverse communication standards (A2A, MCP, ACP etc.); and precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution. We implement structured communication using JSON Schema and conduct a comprehensive threat analysis of our proposal. The result is a foundational directory service addressing the core challenges of secured discovery and interaction in multi-agent systems, paving the way for future interoperable, trustworthy, and scalable agent ecosystems.</description>

      <title>ReaCritic: Large Reasoning Transformer-based DRL Critic-model Scaling For Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) pose critical challenges for intelligent management due to the diverse user requirements and time-varying wireless conditions. These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a large reasoning transformer-based criticmodel scaling scheme that brings reasoning ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks.</description>

      <title>A Highly Scalable LLM Clusters with Optical Interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01503v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose \emph{LumosCore} to build high-bandwidth and large-scale data center networks for LLM jobs. By replacing the core-layer electrical packet switches by optical circuit switches, \emph{LumosCore} could achieves $2\times$ increase in bandwidth or $8\times$ increase in network size. We offer the detailed design of \emph{LumosCore} at both deployment stage and running stage. At deployment stage, we propose Cross Wiring, which is compatible with all possible logical topologies. At running stage, we design polynomial-time algorithms for GPU placement, logical topology generating and OCS reconfiguration to minimize network contention and reduce impact to scheduled jobs. We evaluate \emph{LumosCore} using both testbed experiments and large-scale simulation. Compared to traditional hybrid optical/electrical architectures, \emph{LumosCore} increases the end-to-end training throughput by up to 39.5\% on a 128-node testbed. Compared to the state-of-art Clos architectures, \emph{LumosCore} reduces the average job completion time by up to 34.1\% in a 16k simulation platform.</description>

      <title>Experimental evaluation of xApp Conflict Mitigation Framework in O-RAN: Insights from Testbed deployment in OTIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conflict Mitigation (CM) in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a topic that is gaining importance as commercial O-RAN deployments become more complex. Although research on CM is already covered in terms of simulated network scenarios, it lacks validation using real-world deployment and Over The Air (OTA) Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. Our objective is to conduct the first assessment of the Conflict Mitigation Framework (CMF) for O-RAN using a real-world testbed and OTA RF transmission. This paper presents results of an experiment using a dedicated testbed built in an O-RAN Open Test and Integration Center (OTIC) to confirm the validity of one of the Conflict Resolution (CR) schemes proposed by existing research. The results show that the implemented conflict detection and resolution mechanisms allow a significant improvement in network operation stability by reducing the variability of the measured Downlink (DL) throughput by 78%.</description>

      <title>SoK: Decoding the Enigma of Encrypted Network Traffic Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of modern encryption protocols such as TLS 1.3 has significantly challenged traditional network traffic classification (NTC) methods. As a consequence, researchers are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) approaches to overcome these obstacles. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze ML-based NTC studies, developing a taxonomy of their design choices, benchmarking suites, and prevalent assumptions impacting classifier performance. Through this systematization, we demonstrate widespread reliance on outdated datasets, oversights in design choices, and the consequences of unsubstantiated assumptions. Our evaluation reveals that the majority of proposed encrypted traffic classifiers have mistakenly utilized unencrypted traffic due to the use of legacy datasets. Furthermore, by conducting 348 feature occlusion experiments on state-of-the-art classifiers, we show how oversights in NTC design choices lead to overfitting, and validate or refute prevailing assumptions with empirical evidence. By highlighting lessons learned, we offer strategic insights, identify emerging research directions, and recommend best practices to support the development of real-world applicable NTC methodologies.</description>
