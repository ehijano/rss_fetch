      <title>Blind free deconvolution over one-parameter sparse families via eigenmatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note considers the blind free deconvolution problems of sparse spectral measures from one-parameter families. These problems pose significant challenges since they involve nonlinear sparse recovery. The main technical tool is the eigenmatrix method for solving unstructured sparse recovery problems. The key idea is to turn the nonlinear inverse problem into a linear inverse problem by leveraging the R-transform for free addition and the S-transform for free product. The resulting linear problem is solved with the eigenmatrix method tailored to the domain of the parametric family. Numerical results are provided for both the additive and multiplicative free deconvolutions.</description>

      <title>Stability of neural ODEs by a control over the expansivity of their flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to enhance the stability of a neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) by means of a control over the Lipschitz constant $C$ of its flow. Since it is known that $C$ depends on the logarithmic norm of the Jacobian matrix associated with the neural ODE, we tune this parameter at our convenience by suitably perturbing the Jacobian matrix with a perturbation as small as possible in Frobenius norm. We do so by introducing an optimization problem for which we propose a nested two-level algorithm. For a given perturbation size, the inner level computes the optimal perturbation with a fixed Frobenius norm, while the outer level tunes the perturbation amplitude. We embed the proposed algorithm in the training of the neural ODE to improve its stability. Numerical experiments on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets show that an image classifier including a neural ODE in its architecture trained according to our strategy is more stable than the same classifier trained in the classical way, and therefore, it is more robust and less vulnerable to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph $\G$ (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adiacency matrix $A$, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. Eigenvector centrality consists of ranking the elements of the graph according to the corresponding entries of the Perron eigenvector of $A$, which is associated with the positive eigenvalue with largest modulus.
  An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph $\widetilde{\G}$, with the same structure as $\G$ (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adiacency matrix $\widetilde A$ such that the highest $m$ entries ($m \ge 2$) of the Perron eigenvector of $\widetilde A$ coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations (possibly on a low-rank manifold) in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration.
  The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the graph, which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>Polynomial meshes on algebraic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial meshes (called sometimes "norming sets") allow us to estimate the supremum norm of polynomials on a fixed compact set by the norm on its discrete subset. We give a general construction of polynomial weakly admissible meshes on compact subsets of arbitrary algebraic hypersurfaces in C^{N+1}. They are preimages by a projection of meshes on compacts in C^N. The meshes constructed in this way are optimal in some cases. Our method can be useful also for certain algebraic sets of codimension greater than one. To illustrate applications of the obtained theorems, we first give a few examples and finally report some numerical results. In particular, we present numerical tests (implemented in Matlab), concerning the use of such optimal polynomial meshes for interpolation and least-squares approximation, as well as for the evaluation of the corresponding Lebesgue constants.</description>

      <title>Deep neural network approximation for high-dimensional parabolic partial integro-differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence of a deep neural network (DNN) capable of approximating solutions to partial integro-differential equations while circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Using the Feynman-Kac theorem, we express the solution in terms of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Based on several properties of classical estimators, we establish the existence of a DNN that satisfies the necessary assumptions. The results are theoretical and don't have any numerical experiments yet.</description>

      <title>A numerical Fourier cosine expansion method with higher order Taylor schemes for fully coupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A higher-order numerical method is presented for scalar valued, coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Unlike most classical references, the forward component is not only discretized by an Euler-Maruyama approximation but also by higher-order Taylor schemes. This includes the famous Milstein scheme, providing an improved strong convergence rate of order 1; and the simplified order 2.0 weak Taylor scheme exhibiting weak convergence rate of order 2. In order to have a fully-implementable scheme in case of these higher-order Taylor approximations, which involve the derivatives of the decoupling fields, we use the COS method built on Fourier cosine expansions to approximate the conditional expectations arising from the numerical approximation of the backward component. Even though higher-order numerical approximations for the backward equation are deeply studied in the literature, to the best of our understanding, the present numerical scheme is the first which achieves strong convergence of order 1 for the whole coupled system, including the forward equation, which is often the main interest in applications such as stochastic control. Numerical experiments demonstrate the proclaimed higher-order convergence, both in case of strong and weak convergence rates, for various equations ranging from decoupled to the fully-coupled settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a numerical approach to ensure the preservation of physical bounds on the solutions to linear and nonlinear hyperbolic convection-reaction problems at the discrete level. We provide a rigorous framework for error analysis, formulating the discrete problem as a variational inequality and demonstrate optimal convergence rates in a natural norm. We summarise extensive numerical experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods in preserving physical bounds and preventing unphysical oscillations, even in challenging scenarios involving highly nonlinear reaction terms.</description>

      <title>Convergence theory for two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioners for high-frequency Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a novel convergence theory for two-level hybrid Schwarz domain-decomposition (DD) methods for finite-element discretisations of the high-frequency Helmholtz equation. This theory gives sufficient conditions for the preconditioned matrix to be close to the identity, and covers DD subdomains of arbitrary size, and arbitrary absorbing layers/boundary conditions on both the global and local Helmholtz problems. The assumptions on the coarse space are satisfied by the approximation spaces using problem-adapted basis functions that have been recently analysed as coarse spaces for the Helmholtz equation, as well as all spaces that are known to be quasi-optimal via a Schatz-type argument.
  As an example, we apply this theory when the coarse space consists of piecewise polynomials; these are then the first rigorous convergence results about a two-level Schwarz preconditioner applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with a coarse space that does not consist of problem-adapted basis functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lee and Seung (2000) introduced numerical solutions for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using iterative multiplicative update algorithms. These algorithms have been actively utilized as dimensionality reduction tools for high-dimensional non-negative data and learning algorithms for artificial neural networks. Despite a considerable amount of literature on the applications of the NMF algorithms, detailed explanations about their formulation and derivation are lacking. This report provides supplementary details to help understand the formulation and derivation of the proofs as used in the original paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem for the linear one-dimensional wave equation with variable coefficients consisting in determining an unknown source term from a boundary observation. A method to obtain approximations of this inverse problem using a space discretization based on a mixed finite element method is proposed and analyzed. Its stability and convergence relay on a new uniform boundary observability property with respect to the discretization parameter.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpretation of the Radon Transform's Ray- and Pixel-Driven Discretizations under Balanced Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic investigations are a central tool in medical applications, allowing doctors to image the interior of patients. The corresponding measurement process is commonly modeled by the Radon transform. In practice, the solution of the tomographic problem requires discretization of the Radon transform and its adjoint (called the backprojection). There are various discretization schemes; often structured around three discretization parameters: spatial-, detector-, and angular resolutions. The most widespread approach uses the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection in a balanced resolution setting, i.e., the spatial resolution roughly equals the detector resolution. The use of these particular discretization approaches is based on anecdotal reports of their approximation performance, but there is little rigorous analysis of these methods' approximation errors. This paper presents a novel interpretation of ray-driven and pixel-driven methods as convolutional discretizations, illustrating that from an abstract perspective these methods are similar. Moreover, we announce statements concerning the convergence of the ray-driven Radon transform and the pixel-driven backprojection under balanced resolutions. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments highlighting aspects of the discussed methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stability and convergence analysis of the space-time continuous finite element method for the Hamiltonian formulation of the wave equation. More precisely, we prove a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data in a $C^0([0, T]; X)$-type energy norm, which does not require any restriction on the meshsize or the time steps. Such stability estimates are then used to derive a priori error estimates with quasi-optimal convergence rates, where a suitable treatment of possible nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is pivotal to avoid loss of accuracy. Moreover, based on the properties of a postprocessed approximation, we derive a constant-free, reliable a posteriori error estimate in the $C^0([0, T]; L^2(\Omega))$-norm for the semidiscrete-in-time formulation. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Topology-preserving discretization for the magneto-frictional equations arising in the Parker conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parker conjecture, which explores whether magnetic fields in perfectly conducting plasmas can develop tangential discontinuities during magnetic relaxation, remains an open question in astrophysics. Helicity conservation provides a topological barrier during relaxation, preventing topologically nontrivial initial data relaxing to trivial solutions; preserving this mechanism discretely over long time periods is therefore crucial for numerical simulation. This work presents an energy- and helicity-preserving finite element discretization for the magneto-frictional system, for investigating the Parker conjecture. The algorithm preserves a discrete version of the topological barrier and a discrete Arnold inequality. We also discuss extensions to domains with nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation~blocks.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning for a Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model for morphology formation in organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for the morphology evolution of printed organic solar cells which occurs during the drying of a mixture of polymer, the non-fullerene acceptor and the solvent. Our model uses a phase field approach coupled to a Navier-Stokes equation describing the macroscopic movement of the fluid. Additionally, we incorporate the evaporation process of the solvent using an Allen-Cahn equation.
  The model is discretized using a finite-element approach with a semi-implicit discretization in time. The resulting (non)linear systems are coupled and of large dimensionality. We present a preconditioned iterative scheme to solve them robustly with respect to changes in the discretization parameters. We illustrate that the preconditioned solver shows parameter-robust iteration numbers and that the model qualitatively captures the behavior of the film morphology during drying.</description>

      <title>The Associated Discrete Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and Mean Curvature with Higher order Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the primal and dual constructions yield completely different discrete Laplacians for tetrahedral meshes.In this article, we prove that the discrete Laplacian satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Dirichlet energy in terms of the associated discrete Laplacian corresponding to the dual construction. Specifically, for a three simplex immersed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the associated discrete Laplacian on the tetrahedron can be expressed as the discrete Laplacian of the faces of the tetrahedron and the associated discrete mean curvature term given by the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Based on geometric foundations, we provide a mathematical proof showing that the dual construction gives a optimal Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^3$ compared to the primal construction. Moreover, we show that the associated discrete mean curvature is more sensitive to the initial mesh than other state-of-the-art discrete mean curvatures when the angle changes instantaneously. Instead of improving the angular transient accuracy through mesh subdivision, we can improve the accuracy by providing a higher order approximation of the instantaneous change in angle to reduce the solution error.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of two-step modified Newton method for nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations from transport theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the convergence of a two-step modified Newton method for solving the nonlinear system arising from the minimal nonnegative solution of nonsymmetric algebraic Riccati equations from neutron transport theory. We show the monotonic convergence of the two-step modified Newton method under mild assumptions. When the Jacobian of the nonlinear operator at the minimal positive solution is singular, we present a convergence analysis of the two-step modified Newton method in this context. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method yields comparable results to several existing Newton-type methods and that it brings a significant reduction in computation time for nearly singular and large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Quasiconvex and Relaxed Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish that discontinuous Galerkin methods are capable of producing reliable approximations for a broad class of nonlinear variational problems. In particular, we demonstrate that these schemes provide essential flexibility by removing inter-element continuity while also guaranteeing convergent approximations in the quasiconvex case. Notably, quasiconvexity is the weakest form of convexity pertinent to elasticity. Furthermore, we show that in the non-convex case discrete minimisers converge to minimisers of the relaxed problem. In this case, the minimisation problem corresponds to the energy defined by the quasiconvex envelope of the original energy. Our approach covers all discontinuous Galerkin formulations known to converge for convex energies. This work addresses an open challenge in the vectorial calculus of variations: developing and rigorously justifying numerical schemes capable of reliably approximating nonlinear energy minimization problems with potentially singular solutions, which are frequently encountered in materials science.</description>

      <title>Modeling finite viscoelasticity based on the Green-Naghdi kinematic assumption and generalized strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for finite viscoelasticity, inspired by the kinematic assumption made by Green and Naghdi in plasticity. This approach fundamentally differs from the widely used multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, as the intermediate configuration, a concept that remains debated, becomes unnecessary. The advent of the concept of generalized strains allows the Green-Naghdi assumption to be employed with different strains, offering a flexible mechanism to separate inelastic deformation from total deformation. This leads to a constitutive theory in which the kinematic separation is adjustable and can be calibrated. For quadratic configurational free energy, the framework yields a suite of finite linear viscoelasticity models governed by linear evolution equations. Notably, these models recover established models, including those by Green and Tobolsky (1946) and Simo (1987), when the Seth-Hill strain is chosen with the strain parameter being -2 and 2, respectively. It is also related to the model of Miehe and Keck (2000) when the strain is of the Hencky type. We further extend the approach by adopting coercive strains, which allows us to define an elastic deformation tensor locally. This facilitates modeling the viscous branch using general forms of the configurational free energy, and we construct a micromechanical viscoelastic model as a representative instantiation. The constitutive integration algorithms of the proposed models are detailed. We employ the experimental data of VHB 4910 to examine the proposed models, which demonstrate their effectiveness and potential advantages in the quality of fitting and prediction. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is also conducted to assess the influence of different strains on the viscoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>The Adini finite element on locally refined meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a locally refined version of the Adini finite element for the planar biharmonic equation on rectangular partitions with at most one hanging node per edge. If global continuity of the discrete functions is enforced, for such method there is some freedom in assigning the normal derivative degree of freedom at the hanging nodes. It is proven that the convergence order $h^2$ known for regular solutions and regular partitions is lost for any such choice, and that assigning the average of the normal derivatives at the neighbouring regular vertices is the only choice that achieves a superlinear order, namely $h^{3/2}$ on uniformly refined meshes. On adaptive meshes, the method behaves like a first-order scheme. Furthermore, the reliability and efficiency of an explicit residual-based error estimator are shown up to the best approximation of the Hessian by certain piecewise polynomial functions.</description>

      <title>Regularized dynamical parametric approximation of stiff evolution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary deep neural networks have emerged as a rapidly growing field of research. This paper studies numerical integrators for such and other classes of nonlinear parametrizations $ u(t) = \Phi(\theta(t)) $, where the evolving parameters $\theta(t)$ are to be computed. The primary focus is on tackling the challenges posed by the combination of stiff evolution problems and irregular parametrizations, which typically arise with neural networks, tensor networks, flocks of evolving Gaussians, and in further cases of overparametrization. We propose and analyse regularized parametric versions of the implicit Euler method and higher-order implicit Runge--Kutta methods for the time integration of the parameters in nonlinear approximations to evolutionary partial differential equations and large systems of stiff ordinary differential equations. At each time step, an ill-conditioned nonlinear optimization problem is solved approximately with a few regularized Gauss--Newton iterations. Error bounds for the resulting parametric integrator are derived by relating the computationally accessible Gauss--Newton iteration for the parameters to the computationally inaccessible Newton iteration for the underlying non-parametric time integration scheme. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments that are designed to show key properties of the proposed parametric integrators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of robust and optimal mixed methods based on two mixed formulations of the fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem are developed in this paper. First, a mixed method based on a second-order system is proposed without relying on Nitsche's technique. Robust and optimal error estimates are derived using an $L^2$-bounded interpolation operator for tensors. Then, its connections to other discrete methods, including weak Galerkin methods and a mixed finite element method based on a first-order system, are established. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We present approximation results and numerical experiments for the use of randomized neural networks within physics-informed extreme learning machines to efficiently solve high-dimensional PDEs, demonstrating both high accuracy and low computational cost. Specifically, we prove that RaNNs can approximate certain classes of functions, including Sobolev functions, in the $H^2$-norm at dimension-independent convergence rates, thereby alleviating the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments are provided for the high-dimensional heat equation, the Black-Scholes model, and the Heston model, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of randomized neural networks.</description>

      <title>Deflation-based certified greedy algorithm and adaptivity for bifurcating nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with tailored reduced order models for bifurcating nonlinear parametric partial differential equations, where multiple coexisting solutions arise for a given parametric instance. Approaches based on proper orthogonal decomposition have been widely investigated in the literature, but they usually rely on some \emph{a-priori} knowledge about the bifurcating model and lack any error estimation. On the other hand, standard certified reduced basis techniques fail to represent correctly the branching behavior, since the error estimator is no longer reliable. The main goal of the contribution is to overcome these limitations by introducing two novel algorithms: (i) the adaptive-greedy, detecting the bifurcation point starting from scarce information over the parametric space, and (ii) the deflated-greedy, certifying multiple coexisting branches simultaneously. The former approach takes advantage of the features of the reduced manifold to detect the bifurcation, while the latter exploits the deflation and continuation methods to discover the bifurcating solutions and enrich the reduced space. We test the two strategies for the Coanda effect held by the Navier-Stokes equations in a sudden-expansion channel. The accuracy of the approach and the error certification are compared with vanilla-greedy and proper orthogonal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Median of Means Sampling for the Keister Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of median-of-means sampling compared to traditional mean-of-means sampling for computing the Keister function integral using Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods. The research tests both lattice points and digital nets as point distributions across dimensions 2, 3, 5, and 8, with sample sizes ranging from 2^8 to 2^19 points. Results demonstrate that median-of-means sampling consistently outperforms mean-of-means for sample sizes larger than 10^3 points, while mean-of-means shows better accuracy with smaller sample sizes, particularly for digital nets. The study also confirms previous theoretical predictions about median-of-means' superior performance with larger sample sizes and reflects the known challenges of maintaining accuracy in higher-dimensional integration. These findings support recent research suggesting median-of-means as a promising alternative to traditional sampling methods in numerical integration, though limitations in sample size and dimensionality warrant further investigation with different test functions and larger parameter spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that scalable neuromorphic hardware can implement the finite element method, which is a critical numerical method for engineering and scientific discovery. Our approach maps the sparse interactions between neighboring finite elements to small populations of neurons that dynamically update according to the governing physics of a desired problem description. We show that for the Poisson equation, which describes many physical systems such as gravitational and electrostatic fields, this cortical-inspired neural circuit can achieve comparable levels of numerical accuracy and scaling while enabling the use of inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate that this approach can be used on the Intel Loihi 2 platform and illustrate how this approach can be extended to nontrivial mesh geometries and dynamics.</description>

      <title>PEARL: Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Preconditioner Enhancement through Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning), a novel approach to learning matrix preconditioners. Existing preconditioners such as Jacobi, Incomplete LU, and Algebraic Multigrid methods offer problem-specific advantages but rely heavily on hyperparameter tuning. Recent advances have explored using deep neural networks to learn preconditioners, though challenges such as misbehaved objective functions and costly training procedures remain. PEARL introduces a reinforcement learning approach for learning preconditioners, specifically, a contextual bandit formulation. The framework utilizes an actor-critic model, where the actor generates the incomplete Cholesky decomposition of preconditioners, and the critic evaluates them based on reward-specific feedback. To further guide the training, we design a dual-objective function, combining updates from the critic and condition number. PEARL contributes a generalizable preconditioner learning method, dynamic sparsity exploration, and cosine schedulers for improved stability and exploratory power. We compare our approach to traditional and neural preconditioners, demonstrating improved flexibility and iterative solving speed.</description>

We generalize this result and compute the Wronskian of $\{\sin(mx)\}_{1\le m \le n-1}\cup \{\sin((k+n)x\} $. We show that this determinant can be expressed in terms of Gegenbauer orthogonal polynomials and we give two proofs of this result: a direct proof using recurrence relations and a less direct (but, possibly, more instructive) proof based on Darboux-Crum transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L_p$ approximation error for higher order Korobov functions using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ReLU activation. For target functions having a mixed derivative of order m+1 in each direction, we improve classical approximation rate of second order to (m+1)-th order (modulo a logarithmic factor) in terms of the depth of CNNs. The key ingredient in our analysis is approximate representation of high-order sparse grid basis functions by CNNs. The results suggest that higher order expressivity of CNNs does not severely suffer from the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a full generalization of the classical corner-vector method for constructing weighted spherical designs, which we call the {\it generalized corner-vector method}. First we establish a uniform upper bound for the degree of designs obtained from the proposed method. Our proof is a hybrid argument that employs techniques in analysis and combinatorics, especially a famous result by Xu(1998) on the interrelation between spherical designs and simplical designs, and the cross-ratio comparison method for Hilbert identities introduced by Nozaki and Sawa(2013). We extensively study conditions for the existence of designs obtained from our method, and present many curious examples of degree $7$ through $13$, some of which are, to our surprise, characterized in terms of integral lattices.</description>

      <title>Finding the nearest bounded-real port-Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider linear time-invariant continuous control systems which are bounded real, also known as scattering passive. Our main theoretical contribution is to show the equivalence between such systems and port-Hamiltonian (PH) systems whose factors satisfy certain linear matrix inequalities. Based on this result, we propose a formulation for the problem of finding the nearest bounded-real system to a given system, and design an algorithm combining alternating optimization and Nesterov's fast gradient method. This formulation also allows us to check whether a given system is bounded real by solving a semidefinite program, and provide a PH parametrization for it. We illustrate our proposed algorithms on real and synthetic data sets.</description>

      <title>Quantim-Inspired Solver for Simulating Material Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of tensor networks (TNs) to the simulation of material deformations within the framework of linear elasticity. Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop in this work the first polytopal complexes of differential forms.
  These complexes, inspired by the Discrete De Rham and the Virtual Element approaches, are discrete versions of the de Rham complex of differential forms built on meshes made of general polytopal elements.
  Both constructions benefit from the high-level approach of polytopal methods, which leads, on certain meshes, to leaner constructions than the finite element method.
  We establish commutation properties between the interpolators and the discrete and continuous exterior derivatives, prove key polynomial consistency results for the complexes, and show that their cohomologies are isomorphic to the cohomology of the continuous de Rham complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a general criterion providing sufficient conditions under which a time-discretiziation of a given Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a uniform in time approximation of the SDE. The criterion is also, to a certain extent, discussed in the paper, necessary. Using such a criterion we then analyse the convergence properties of numerical methods for solutions of SDEs; we consider Explicit and Implicit Euler, split-step and (truncated) tamed Euler methods. In particular, we show that, under mild conditions on the coefficients of the SDE (locally Lipschitz and strictly monotonic), these methods produce approximations of the law of the solution of the SDE that converge uniformly in time. The theoretical results are verified by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Novel Stochastic Interacting Particle-Field Algorithm for 3D Parabolic-Parabolic Keller-Segel Chemotaxis System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient stochastic interacting particle-field (SIPF) algorithm with no history dependence for computing aggregation patterns and near singular solutions of parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) chemotaxis system in three space dimensions (3D). The KS solutions are approximated as empirical measures of particles coupled with a smoother field (concentration of chemo-attractant) variable computed by the spectral method. Instead of using heat kernels causing history dependence and high memory cost, we leverage the implicit Euler discretization to derive a one-step recursion in time for stochastic particle positions and the field variable based on the explicit Green's function of an elliptic operator of the form Laplacian minus a positive constant. In numerical experiments, we observe that the resulting SIPF algorithm is convergent and self-adaptive to the high gradient part of solutions. Despite the lack of analytical knowledge (e.g. a self-similar ansatz) of the blowup, the SIPF algorithm provides a low-cost approach to study the emergence of finite time blowup in 3D by only dozens of Fourier modes and through varying the amount of initial mass and tracking the evolution of the field variable. Notably, the algorithm can handle at ease multi-modal initial data and the subsequent complex evolution involving the merging of particle clusters and formation of a finite time singularity.</description>

Abstract: This paper is focused on the convergence analysis of an adaptive stochastic collocation algorithm for the stationary diffusion equation with parametric coefficient. The algorithm employs sparse grid collocation in the parameter domain alongside finite element approximations in the spatial domain, and adaptivity is driven by recently proposed parametric and spatial a posteriori error indicators. We prove that for a general diffusion coefficient with finite-dimensional parametrization, the algorithm drives the underlying error estimates to zero. Thus, our analysis covers problems with affine and nonaffine parametric coefficient dependence.</description>

      <title>Developing robust incomplete Cholesky factorizations in half precision arithmetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomplete factorizations have long been popular general-purpose algebraic preconditioners for solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Guaranteeing the factorization is breakdown free while computing a high quality preconditioner is challenging. A resurgence of interest in using low precision arithmetic makes the search for robustness more important and more challenging. In this paper, we focus on ill-conditioned symmetric positive definite problems and explore a number of approaches for preventing and handling breakdowns: prescaling of the system matrix, a look-ahead strategy to anticipate breakdown as early as possible, the use of global shifts, and a modification of an idea developed in the field of numerical optimization for the complete Cholesky factorization of dense matrices. Our numerical simulations target highly ill-conditioned sparse linear systems with the goal of computing the factors in half precision arithmetic and then achieving double precision accuracy using mixed precision refinement. We also consider the often overlooked issue of growth in the sizes of entries in the factors that can occur when using any precision and can render the computed factors ineffective as preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Generalized convergence of the deep BSDE method: a step towards fully-coupled FBSDEs and applications in stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with high-dimensional coupled FBSDE systems approximated by the deep BSDE method of Han et al. (2018). It was shown by Han and Long (2020) that the errors induced by the deep BSDE method admit a posteriori estimate depending on the loss function, whenever the backward equation only couples into the forward diffusion through the Y process. We generalize this result to drift coefficients that may also depend on Z, and give sufficient conditions for convergence under standard assumptions. The resulting conditions are directly verifiable for any equation. Consequently, unlike in earlier theory, our convergence analysis enables the treatment of FBSDEs stemming from stochastic optimal control problems. In particular, we provide a theoretical justification for the non-convergence of the deep BSDE method observed in recent literature, and present direct guidelines for when convergence can be guaranteed in practice. Our theoretical findings are supported by several numerical experiments in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Two-point stress approximation: A simple and robust finite volume method for linearized (poro-)mechanics and Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a simple and robust two-point finite volume discretization applicable to isotropic linearized elasticity, valid in also in the incompressible Stokes' limit. The discretization is based only on co-located, cell-centered variables, and has a minimal discretization stencil, using only the two neighboring cells to a face to calculate numerical stresses and fluxes. The discretization naturally couples to finite volume discretizations of flow, providing a stable discretization of poroelasticity.
  We show well-posedness of a weak statement of the continuous formulation in appropriate Hilbert spaces, and identify the appropriate weighted norms for the problem. For the discrete approximations, we prove stability and convergence, both of which are robust in terms of the material parameters. Numerical experiments in 3D support the theoretical results, and provide additional insight into the practical performance of the discretization.</description>

      <title>Far-field displacement singularity elimination for time-dependent complex variable method on quasi-three dimensional gravitational shallow tunnelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper identifies the nonzero resultant and consequent unique displacement singularity of time-dependent complex variable method on quasi-three dimensional shallow tunnelling in visco-elastic and gravitational geomaterial. The quasi-three dimensional problem is equivalently simplified into a plane-strain one using a time-dependent coefficient of convergence confinement method to simulate the progressive release of initial stress field. The unique displacement singularity is thereby eliminated by fixing the far-field ground surface to produce corresponding counter-acting force to equilibriate the nonzero resultant to formalize a strict equilibrium mechanical model. The mixed boundaries of fixed far-field ground surface and nearby free segment form a homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problem with extra constraints of the virtual traction along tunnel periphery, which is simultaneously solved using an iterative linear system with good numerical stability. The mixed boundary conditions along the ground surface in the whole excavation time span are well satisfied, and detailed comparisons with corresponding finite element solution are conducted. The comparison results are in good agreements, and the proposed solution illustrates high efficiency. More discussions are made on excavation rate, viscosity, and solution convergence. A latent paradox is additionally disclosed for objectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel random integration algorithm that boasts both high convergence order and polynomial tractability for functions characterized by sparse frequencies or rapidly decaying Fourier coefficients. Specifically, for integration in periodic isotropic Sobolev space and the isotropic Sobolev space with compact support, our approach attains a nearly optimal root mean square error (RMSE) bound. In contrast to previous nearly optimal algorithms, our method exhibits polynomial tractability, ensuring that the number of samples does not scale exponentially with increasing dimensions. Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm. For integration in the Wiener algebra, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the decay rate of Fourier coefficients. The effectiveness of the integration is confirmed through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis for a Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization Problem in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a fully discrete approximation for a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem (P) with applications in acoustic full waveform inversion. The optimization problem is primarily complicated by the hyperbolic character and the second-order bilinear structure in the governing wave equation. While the control parameter is discretized using the piecewise constant elements, the state discretization is realized through an auxiliary first-order system along with the leapfrog time-stepping method and continuous piecewise linear elements. The resulting fully discrete minimization problem ($\text{P}_h$) is shown to be well-defined. Furthermore, building upon a suitable CFL-condition, we prove stability and uniform convergence of the state discretization. Our final result is the strong convergence result for ($\text{P}_h$) in the following sense: Given a local minimizer $\overline \nu$ of (P) satisfying a reasonable growth condition, there exists a sequence of local minimizers of ($\text{P}_h$) converging strongly towards $\overline \nu$.</description>

      <title>Impact of Numerical Fluxes on High Order Semidiscrete WENO-DeC Finite Volume Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we compare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear semidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed for order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes selected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes, namely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave propagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the Riemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include two subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes, $A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem. For incomplete upwind ones, $A&lt;E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical fluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS). We find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the methods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and on the order of accuracy of the scheme. It also depends on the type of problem; that is, whether the solution is smooth or discontinuous, whether discontinuities are linear or nonlinear, whether linear discontinuities are fast- or slowly-moving, and whether the solution is evolved for short or long time.</description>

Abstract: We make a full landscape analysis of the (generally non-convex) orthogonal Procrustes problem. This problem is equivalent to computing the polar factor of a square matrix. We reveal a convexity-like structure, which explains the already established tractability of the problem and show that gradient descent in the orthogonal group computes the polar factor of a square matrix with linear convergence rate if the matrix is invertible and with an algebraic one if the matrix is singular. These results are similar to the ones of Alimisis and Vandereycken (2024) for the symmetric eigenvalue problem.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Physics Informed Neural Networks: Formulation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider time-dependent PDEs discretized by a special class of Physics Informed Neural Networks whose design is based on the framework of Runge--Kutta and related time-Galerkin discretizations. The primary motivation for using such methods is that alternative time-discrete schemes not only enable higher-order approximations but also have a crucial impact on the qualitative behavior of the discrete solutions. The design of the methods follows a novel training approach based on two key principles: (a) the discrete loss is designed using a time-discrete framework, and (b) the final loss formulation incorporates Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin discretization in a carefully structured manner. We then demonstrate that the resulting methods inherit the stability properties of the Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin schemes, and furthermore, their computational behavior aligns with that of the original time discrete method used in their formulation. In our analysis, we focus on linear parabolic equations, demonstrating both the stability of the methods and the convergence of the discrete minimizers to solutions of the underlying evolution PDE. An important novel aspect of our work is the derivation of maximal regularity (MR) estimates for B-stable Runge--Kutta schemes and both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations. This allows us to provide new energy-based proofs for maximal regularity estimates previously established by Kov\'acs, Li, and Lubich, now in the Hilbert space setting and with the flexibility of variable time steps.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a stabilized scheme for an optimal control problem governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2,$ governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion equation with pointwise control constraints. We follow the optimize--then--discretize--approach, where for the state and the co-state variables, we consider the piecewise finite element method alongside the algebraic flux correction method for its stabilization and the for temporal discretization, we use the backward Euler method for the state variable and the explicit Euler method for the co-state variable. The discrete control variable is obtained by projecting the discretized adjoint state onto the set of admissible controls. The resulting stabilized fully--discrete scheme is nonlinear and a fixed point argument is used in order to prove its existence and uniqueness under a mild condition between the time step $k$ and the mesh step $h,$ e.g., $k = \mathcal{O}(h^{1+\epsilon}),\,0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1.$ Further, for sufficiently regular solution, we derive error estimates in $L^2$ and $H^1$ norm with respect on space and $\ell^\infty$ norm in time for the state and the co-state variables. For the control variable we also derive an $L^2$ estimate for its error with respect to spatial variable and $\ell^\infty$ in time. Finally, we present numerical experiments that validate the the order of convergence of the stabilized fully--discrete scheme via the algebraic flux correction method as well as we test the stabilized fully--discrete scheme in optimal control problems governed by a convection--dominant equation where the solution possesses interior or boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Optimal error bounds on an exponential wave integrator Fourier spectral method for fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations with low regularity potential and nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish optimal error bounds on an exponential wave integrator (EWI) for the space fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (SFNLSE) with low regularity potential and/or nonlinearity. For the semi-discretization in time, under the assumption of $L^\infty$-potential, $C^1$-nonlinearity, and $H^\alpha$-solution with $1&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ being the fractional index of $(-\Delta)^\frac{\alpha}{2}$, we prove an optimal first-order $L^2$-norm error bound $O(\tau)$ and a uniform $H^\alpha$-norm bound of the semi-discrete numerical solution, where $\tau$ is the time step size. We further discretize the EWI in space by the Fourier spectral method and obtain an optimal error bound in $L^{2}$-norm $O(\tau+h^{m})$ without introducing any CFL-type time step size restrictions, where $h$ is the spatial step size, $m$ is the regularity of the exact solution. Moreover, under slightly stronger regularity assumptions, we obtain optimal error bounds $O(\tau)$ and $O(\tau+h^{m-{\frac{\alpha}{2}}})$ in $H^\frac{\alpha}{2}$-norm, which is the norm associated to the energy. Extensive numerical examples are provided to validate the optimal error bounds and show their sharpness. We also find distinct evolving patterns between the SFNLSE and the classical nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in scientific machine learning, especially when surrogate models are used to approximate complex systems. Although multilayer perceptions (MLPs) are commonly employed as surrogates, they often suffer from overfitting due to their large number of parameters. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) offer an alternative solution with fewer parameters. However, gradient-based inference methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), may result in computational inefficiency when applied to KANs, especially for large-scale datasets, due to the high cost of back-propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, combining the dropout Tikhonov ensemble Kalman inversion (DTEKI) with Chebyshev KANs. This gradient-free method effectively mitigates overfitting and enhances numerical stability. Additionally, we incorporate the active subspace method to reduce the parameter-space dimensionality, allowing us to improve the accuracy of predictions and obtain more reliable uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various test cases, including scenarios with large datasets and high noise levels. Our results show that the new method achieves comparable or better accuracy, much higher efficiency as well as stability compared to HMC, in addition to scalability. Moreover, by leveraging the low-dimensional parameter subspace, our method preserves prediction accuracy while substantially reducing further the computational cost.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Gradient Descent Method with Stochastic Fixed-point Rounding Errors under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When training neural networks with low-precision computation, rounding errors often cause stagnation or are detrimental to the convergence of the optimizers; in this paper we study the influence of rounding errors on the convergence of the gradient descent method for problems satisfying the Polyak-\Lojasiewicz inequality. Within this context, we show that, in contrast, biased stochastic rounding errors may be beneficial since choosing a proper rounding strategy eliminates the vanishing gradient problem and forces the rounding bias in a descent direction. Furthermore, we obtain a bound on the convergence rate that is stricter than the one achieved by unbiased stochastic rounding. The theoretical analysis is validated by comparing the performances of various rounding strategies when optimizing several examples using low-precision fixed-point number formats.</description>

      <title>Wellposedness, exponential ergodicity and numerical approximation of fully super-linear McKean--Vlasov SDEs and associated particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of McKean--Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts and diffusions having super-linear growth in measure and space -- the maps have general polynomial form but also satisfy a certain monotonicity condition. The combination of the drift's super-linear growth in measure (by way of a convolution) and the super-linear growth in space and measure of the diffusion coefficient requires novel technical elements in order to obtain the main results. We establish wellposedness, propagation of chaos (PoC), and under further assumptions on the model parameters, we show an exponential ergodicity property alongside the existence of an invariant distribution. No differentiability or non-degeneracy conditions are required.
  Further, we present a particle system based Euler-type split-step scheme (SSM) for the simulation of this type of MV-SDEs. The scheme attains, in stepsize, the strong error rate $1/2$ in the non-path-space root-mean-square error metric and we demonstrate the property of mean-square contraction. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples including: estimation of PoC rates across dimensions, preservation of periodic phase-space, and the observation that taming appears to be not a suitable method unless strong dissipativity is present.</description>

      <title>A rigorous integrator and global existence for higher-dimensional semilinear parabolic PDEs via semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general constructive method to compute solutions of initial value problems of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations on hyper-rectangular domains via semigroup theory and computer-assisted proofs. Once a numerical candidate for the solution is obtained via a finite dimensional projection, Chebyshev series expansions are used to solve the linearized equations about the approximation from which a solution map operator is constructed. Using the solution operator (which exists from semigroup theory), we define an infinite dimensional contraction operator whose unique fixed point together with its rigorous bounds provide the local inclusion of the solution. Applying this technique for multiple time steps leads to constructive proofs of existence of solutions over long time intervals. As applications, we study the 3D/2D Swift-Hohenberg, where we combine our method with explicit constructions of trapping regions to prove global existence of solutions of initial value problems converging asymptotically to nontrivial equilibria. A second application consists of the 2D Ohta-Kawasaki equation, providing a framework for handling derivatives in nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with Domain Transformation for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in quantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the integrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that typically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing Fourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor product (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to $[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at the corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation procedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The proposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original integrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs, and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain for options with up to 15 assets.</description>

      <title>Useful Compact Representations for Data-Fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For minimization problems without 2nd derivative information, methods that estimate Hessian matrices can be very effective. However, conventional techniques generate dense matrices that are prohibitive for large problems. Limited-memory compact representations express the dense arrays in terms of a low rank representation and have become the state-of-the-art for software implementations on large deterministic problems. We develop new compact representations that are parameterized by a choice of vectors and that reduce to existing well known formulas for special choices. We demonstrate effectiveness of the compact representations for large eigenvalue computations, tensor factorizations and nonlinear regressions.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>Approximating exponentials of commutators by optimized product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotter product formulas constitute a cornerstone quantum Hamiltonian simulation technique. However, the efficient implementation of Hamiltonian evolution of nested commutators remains an under explored area. In this work, we construct optimized product formulas of orders 3 to 6 approximating the exponential of a commutator of two arbitrary operators in terms of the exponentials of the operators involved. The new schemes require a reduced number of exponentials and thus provide more efficient approximations than other previously published alternatives. They can also be used as basic methods in recursive procedures to increase the order of approximation. We expect this research will improve the efficiency of quantum control protocols, as well as quantum algorithms such as the Zassenhaus-based product formula, Magnus operator-based time-dependent simulation, and product formula schemes with modified potentials.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving forward and inverse problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). While advancements in loss functions and network architectures have improved PINN accuracy, the impact of collocation point sampling on their performance remains underexplored. Fixed sampling methods, such as uniform random sampling and equispaced grids, can fail to capture critical regions with high solution gradients, limiting their effectiveness for complex PDEs. Adaptive methods, inspired by adaptive mesh refinement from traditional numerical methods, address this by dynamically updating collocation points during training but may overlook residual dynamics between updates, potentially losing valuable information. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive collocation point selection strategy utilizing the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (QR-DEIM), a reduced-order modeling technique for efficiently approximating nonlinear functions. Our results on benchmark PDEs, including the wave, Allen-Cahn, and Burgers' equations, demonstrate that our QR-DEIM-based approach improves PINN accuracy compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for adaptive collocation point strategies.</description>
