      <title>Graph sub-sampling for divide-and-conquer algorithms in large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As networks continue to increase in size, current methods must be capable of handling large numbers of nodes and edges in order to be practically relevant. Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach. Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, sub-sampling is not a trivial task. While this problem has gained attention in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community. In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure. After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes. We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance. For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling. The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</description>

      <title>A Novel Voting System for Medical Catalogues in National Health Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the conceptual development of a medical insurance catalogue voting system. The methodology is centred on creating a model where doctors would vote on treatment inclusions, aiming to demonstrate transparency and integrity. The results from Monte Carlo simulations suggest a robust consensus on the selection of medicines and treatments. Further theoretical investigations propose incorporating a patient outcome-based incentive mechanism. This conceptual approach could enhance decision-making in healthcare by aligning stakeholder interests with patient outcomes, aiming for an optimised, equitable insurance catalogue with potential blockchain-based smart-contracts to ensure transparency and integrity.</description>

      <title>DisasterNeedFinder: Understanding the Information Needs in the 2024 Noto Earthquake (Comprehensive Explanation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate the DisasterNeedFinder framework in order to provide appropriate information support for the Noto Peninsula Earthquake. In the event of a large-scale disaster, it is essential to accurately capture the ever-changing information needs. However, it is difficult to obtain appropriate information from the chaotic situation on the ground. Therefore, as a data-driven approach, we aim to pick up precise information needs at the site by integrally analyzing the location information of disaster victims and search information. It is difficult to make a clear estimation of information needs by just analyzing search history information in disaster areas, due to the large amount of noise and the small number of users. Therefore, the idea of assuming that the magnitude of information needs is not the volume of searches, but the degree of abnormalities in searches, enables an appropriate understanding of the information needs of the disaster victims. DNF has been continuously clarifying the information needs of disaster areas since the disaster strike, and has been recognized as a new approach to support disaster areas by being featured in the major Japanese media on several occasions.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Scoping for Graph Neural Networks under Heterophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs) as their superior performance typically comes from aggregating homophilous information. Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, uniformly expanding the scope results in subpar performance since real-world graphs often exhibit homophily disparity between nodes. An ideal way is personalized scopes, allowing nodes to have varying scope sizes. Existing methods typically add node-adaptive weights for each hop. Although expressive, they inevitably suffer from severe overfitting. To address this issue, we formalize personalized scoping as a separate scope classification problem that overcomes GNN overfitting in node classification. Specifically, we predict the optimal GNN depth for each node. Our theoretical and empirical analysis suggests that accurately predicting the depth can significantly enhance generalization. We further propose Adaptive Scope (AS), a lightweight MLP-based approach that only participates in GNN inference. AS encodes structural patterns and predicts the depth to select the best model for each node's prediction. Experimental results show that AS is highly flexible with various GNN architectures across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards Islam using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection and greater explainability. In this work, we represent speeches as nodes and connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. This study introduces a novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam. Our model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while providing valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.</description>

      <title>Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.</description>
