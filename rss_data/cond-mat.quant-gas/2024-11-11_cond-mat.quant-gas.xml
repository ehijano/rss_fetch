      <title>Numerical investigation of quantum phases and phase transitions in a two-leg ladder of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Direct production of fermionic superfluids in a cavity-enhanced optical dipole trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the production of quantum degenerate, superfluid gases of $^6$Li through direct evaporative cooling in a cavity-enhanced optical dipole trap. The entire evaporative cooling process is performed in a trap created by the TEM$_{00}$ mode of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity, simultaneously driven on several successive longitudinal modes. This leads to near-complete cancellation of the inherent lattice structure along the axial direction of the cavity, as evidenced by the observation of long-lived dipole oscillations of the atomic cloud. We demonstrate the production of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates upon adiabatic conversion of a unitary Fermi gas evaporatively cooled in this trap. The lifetime and heating in the cavity trap is similar to that of a running wave dipole trap. Our system enables the optical production of ultracold samples using a total trap-laser power below $1$ W, leveraging the benefits of optical resonators as dipole traps in quantum gas research while maintaining a simple resonator design and minimizing additional experimental complexity.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum computing Feynman diagrams in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that recent experiments in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices that measure the phase-space characteristic function of the oscillator via the qubit can be seen through the lens of functional calculus and path integrals, drawing a clear analogy with the generating functional of a quantum field theory. This connection suggests an expansion of the characteristic function in terms of Feynman diagrams, exposing the role of the real-time bosonic propagator, and identifying the external source functions with certain time-dependent couplings that can be controlled experimentally. By applying maximum-likelihood techniques, we show that the ``measurement'' of these Feynman diagrams can be reformulated as a problem of multi-parameter point estimation that takes as input a set of Ramsey-type measurements of the qubit. By numerical simulations that consider leading imperfections in trapped-ion devices, we identify the optimal regimes in which Feynman diagrams could be reconstructed from measured data with low systematic and stochastic errors. We discuss how these ideas can be generalized to finite temperatures via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, contributing to a bottom-up approach to probe quantum simulators of lattice field theories by systematically increasing the qubit-oscillator number.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps.</description>

      <title>Long-term stable laser injection locking for quasi-CW applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high output powers while achieving narrow line single mode lasing are often mutual exclusive properties of commercial laser diodes. For this reason, efficient and scalable amplification of narrow line laser light is still a major driving point in modern laser system designs. Commonly, injection locking of high-power semiconductor laser diodes are used for this purpose. However, for many laser diodes it is very challenging to achieve stable operation of the injection locked state due to a complex interplay of non-linearities and thermal effects. Different approaches of active or passive stabilization usually require a large overhead of optical and electrical equipment and are not generally applicable. In our work we present a passive stabilization scheme, that is generally applicable, technically easy to implement and extremely cost-effective. It is based on the externally synchronized automatic acquisition of the optimal injection state. Central to our simple but powerful scheme is the management of thermalization effects during lock acquisition. By periodical relocking, spectrally pure amplified light is maintained in a quasi-CW manner over long timescales. We characterize the performance of our method for laser diodes amplifying 671 nm light and demonstrate the general applicability by confirming the method to work also for laser diodes at 401 nm, 461 nm and 689 nm. Our scheme enables the scaled operation of injection locks, even in cascaded setups, for the distributed amplification of single frequency laser light.</description>

      <title>Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>

      <title>Many-body Physics of Ultracold Alkaline-Earth atoms with SU($N$)-symmetric interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in understanding phases of matter and the transitions between them. Theoretical investigations of quantum models with SU($N$) symmetry have provided important insights into many-body phenomena. However, these models have generally remained a theoretical idealization, since it is very difficult to exactly realize the SU($N$) symmetry in conventional quantum materials for large $N$. Intriguingly however, in recent years, ultracold alkaline-earth-atom (AEA) quantum simulators have paved the path to realize SU($N$)-symmetric many-body models, where $N$ is tunable and can be as large as 10. This symmetry emerges due to the closed shell structure of AEAs, thereby leading to a perfect decoupling of the electronic degrees of freedom from the nuclear spin. In this work, we provide a systematic review of recent theoretical and experimental work on the many-body physics of these systems. We first discuss the thermodynamic properties and collective modes of trapped Fermi gases, highlighting the enhanced interaction effects that appear as $N$ increases. We then discuss the properties of the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model, focusing on some of the major experimental achievements in this area. We conclude with a compendium highlighting some of the significant theoretical progress on SU($N$) lattice models and a discussion of some exciting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in fragmented Hilbert spaces of one-dimensional fermionic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover that the interplay between Hilbert space fragmentation and multiple non-Hermitian pumping channels leads to distinct non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in real and Fock spaces. Using an extended Hatano-Nelson model with next-nearest neighbor hopping and a strong interaction as an example, we find that two fermions loaded in the lattice exhibit different real-space NHSE depending on the Hilbert space fragments they belong to. Moreover, in the high-energy sector resulting from the fragmentation, the two-particle bound states form a one-dimensional lattice in Fock space, resulting in the Fock-space NHSE. At half-filling, while real-space NHSE is suppressed by many-body effects, richer patterns of Fock-space skin-like localization are found to emerge for different fragmented energy sectors and subsectors. This work extends our understanding of the interplay between NHSE and Hilbert space fragmentation and provides detailed insights into their manifestation in interacting non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>
