      <title>Unlocking Location Intelligence: A Survey from Deep Learning to The LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI. The summary of the up-to-date paper list can be found in https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/Awesome-Location-Intelligence and will undergo continuous updates.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Based Structuring and Analysis of North Macedonian Public Procurement Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public procurement plays a critical role in government operations, ensuring the efficient allocation of resources and fostering economic growth. However, traditional procurement data is often stored in rigid, tabular formats, limiting its analytical potential and hindering transparency. This research presents a methodological framework for transforming structured procurement data into a semantic knowledge graph, leveraging ontological modeling and automated data transformation techniques. By integrating RDF and SPARQL-based querying, the system enhances the accessibility and interpretability of procurement records, enabling complex semantic queries and advanced analytics. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning-driven predictive modeling, the system extends beyond conventional data analysis, offering insights into procurement trends and risk assessment. This work contributes to the broader field of public procurement intelligence by improving data transparency, supporting evidence-based decision-making, and enabling in-depth analysis of procurement activities in North Macedonia.</description>

      <title>Approximation-First Timeseries Monitoring Query At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timeseries monitoring systems such as Prometheus play a crucial role in gaining observability of the underlying system components. These systems collect timeseries metrics from various system components and perform monitoring queries over periodic window-based aggregations (i.e., rule queries). However, despite wide adoption, the operational costs and query latency of rule queries remain high. In this paper, we identify major bottlenecks associated with repeated data scans and query computations concerning window overlaps in rule queries, and present PromSketch, an approximation-first query framework as intermediate caches for monitoring systems. It enables low operational costs and query latency, by combining approximate window-based query frameworks and sketch-based precomputation. PromSketch is implemented as a standalone module that can be integrated into Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, covering 70% of Prometheus' aggregation over time queries. Our evaluation shows that PromSketch achieves up to a two orders of magnitude reduction in query latency over Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, while lowering operational dollar costs of query processing by two orders of magnitude compared to Prometheus and by at least 4x compared to VictoriaMetrics with at most 5% average errors across statistics.

      <title>Lost in Models? Structuring Managerial Decision Support in Process Mining with Multi-criteria Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process mining is increasingly adopted in modern organizations, producing numerous process models that, while valuable, can lead to model overload and decision-making complexity. This paper explores a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex organizational settings.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Handling in DatalogMTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL, an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs (possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under repair-based semantics.</description>
