      <title>Dynamics of $E_6$ Chiral Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact non-perturbative solutions to chiral gauge theories based on the $E_6$ gauge group and several matter fermions in the fundamental $\bf{27}$-dimensional representation. They are obtained when supersymmetric versions are perturbed by small supersymmetry breaking by anomaly mediation. The universality classes obtained are very different from what can be conjectured by the tumbling hypothesis. In particular, the case with three $\bf{27}$s may have an unbroken $\text{SU}(3)$ symmetry with massless composite fermions in $\bf{10}$ of $\text{SU}(3)$. For this case, we employed numerical techniques to obtain the exact ground state.</description>

      <title>Type I anomaly cancellation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the issue of how the perturbative and global fermion anomaly of Type I string theory in ten dimensions is cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism using the RR fields. This will be done by realising the RR fields as boundary modes of an eleven-dimensional bulk theory described in terms of a quadratic refinement of the differential KO-theory pairing.
  We also discuss in a more general setting the procedures which need to be followed when we try to cancel fermion anomalies in terms of $p$-form fields based on differential K-theory classes. This we illustrate by performing an analysis of the mod-2 anomaly cancellation in nine dimensions arising from the $S^1$ compactification of the Type I theory.</description>

      <title>Localized Gravity, de Sitter, and the Horizon Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing de Sitter-like solutions in string theory remains challenging, prompting speculation about which specific feature might be responsible for their inconsistency in quantum gravity. In this work, we focus on the `Horizon Criterion', which identifies spacetimes as problematic if they exhibit cosmological horizons. In particular, we study the implications for spacetimes with dynamical boundaries. We argue that requiring inertial observers localized on an end-of-the-world (ETW) brane to be in causal contact with every other observer is too restrictive as there exist string-theoretic solutions without this property. Hence, if one does not want to abandon the idea of cosmological horizons being the fundamental issue with de Sitter, a refined condition is needed. The requirement that inertial, boundary-localized observers should be in causal contact with all other observers on the same ETW brane is such an appropriate refinement. We explore the consequences of this criterion for ETW branes whose energy density is governed by a scalar field, considering two cases: First, with a scalar field confined to the ETW brane, and second, with a bulk modulus subject to a brane-localized potential.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet fermion correlators, modular tensors and higher genus integration kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series and Superconformal Indices of the Improved Bifundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the structure of the moduli space of vacua of Improved Bifundamentals, a recently introduced class of superconformal field theories. Utilizing the Hilbert Series, computed as a specific limit of the Superconformal Index, we establish that the moduli spaces of these theories are irreducible algebraic varieties, presenting a single connected component as opposed to the more common scenario of multiple intersecting branches found in typical SCFT moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Probing black hole entropy via entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method to extract the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of $D$-dimensional black holes using the entanglement entropy of a lower-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). This approach relies on two key observations. On the gravitational side, the near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes is AdS$_{2}$, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is entirely determined by this two-dimensional geometry. Moreover, the higher-dimensional spherical part of the black hole metric is absorbed into the $D$-dimensional Newton's constant $G_{N}^{\left(D\right)}$, which can be effectively reduced to a two-dimensional Newton's constant $G_{N}^{\left(2\right)}$. On the field theory side, the entanglement entropy of two disconnected one-dimensional conformal quantum mechanics (CQM$_{1}$) can be calculated. According to the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription, this entanglement entropy computes the area of the minimal surface in the AdS$_{2}$ geometry. Since the near-horizon region of the black hole and the emergent spacetime derived from the entanglement entropy share the same Penrose diagram -- with both the black hole event horizon and the RT surface corresponding to specific points on this diagram -- the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be probed via entanglement entropy when these points coincide. This result explicitly demonstrates that the entanglement across the event horizon is the fundamental origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian approach to isospinning ${\mathbb C}P^2$ solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isorotating ${\mathbb C}P^2$ Q-solitons in $2+1$ dimensions were studied. Hamiltonian formalism as a more physically meaningful yet fairly demanding approach was adopted during the investigation, which helped to exclude unobservable parameters such as angular frequencies and Lagrangian. This approach also highlighted the non-topological nature of the stabilization mechanism and revealed a number of similarities between well-known $U(1)$ Q-balls and ${\mathbb C}P^2$ isospinning solitons, thus rendering the latter a suitable extension of the former for the case of higher Lagrangian symmetry group and paving the way for further ${\mathbb C}P^N$ generalizations. Due to the peculiarities of the model, numerical optimisation algorithms were chosen to obtain the solutions.</description>

      <title>De Sitter JT gravity from double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) reduces to JT gravity with a negative cosmological constant by zooming in on the lower edge $E=-E_0$ of the spectrum. We find that the de Sitter JT gravity (i.e. JT gravity with a positive cosmological constant) is reproduced from DSSYK by taking a scaling limit around the upper edge $E=E_0$ of the spectrum. We also argue that the appearance of de Sitter JT gravity is consistent with the behavior of the classical solution of the sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two rainbow tensor models with multi-tensors of rank-$3$ and present their $W$-representations. We give the formula of counting number of independent gauge-invariant operators in terms of Hurwitz numbers and establish a one-to-one correspondence between connected operators and colored Dessins. By means of the colored Dessins and $W$-representations, respectively, we derive two compact expressions of correlators for each of rainbow tensor models. Furthermore, two complex multi-matrix models from the degradations of the constructed rainbow tensor models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Entanglement in Lifshitz Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Holographic geometry/real-space entanglement correspondence and metric reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holography, the boundary entanglement structure is believed to be encoded in the bulk geometry. In this work, we investigate the precise correspondence between the boundary real-space entanglement and the bulk geometry. By the boundary real-space entanglement, we refer to the conditional mutual information (CMI) for two infinitesimal subsystems separated by a distance $l$, and the corresponding bulk geometry is at a radial position $z_*$, namely the turning point of the entanglement wedge for a boundary region with a length scale $l$. In a generic geometry described by a given coordinate system, $z_*$ can be determined locally by $l$, while the exact expression for $z_*(l)$ depends on the gauge choice, reflecting the inherent nonlocality of this seemingly local correspondence. We propose to specify the function $z_*(l)$ as the criterion for a gauge choice, and with the specified gauge function, we verify the exact correspondence between the boundary real-space entanglement and the bulk geometry. Inspired by this correspondence, we propose a new method of bulk metric reconstruction from boundary entanglement data, namely the CMI reconstruction. In this CMI proposal, with the gauge fixed a priori by specifying $z_*(l)$, the bulk metric can be reconstructed from the relation between the bulk geometry and the boundary CMI. The CMI reconstruction method establishes a connection between the differential entropy prescription and Bilson's general algorithm for metric reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Transmutation and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a situation where a global symmetry of the ultraviolet (UV) theory does not act faithfully on the local infrared (IR) degrees of freedom, but instead acts effectively as a higher-form symmetry. We refer to this phenomenon as symmetry transmutation, where the UV symmetry is "transmuted" into a higher-form symmetry in the IR. Notably, unlike emergent (accidental) symmetries, which are approximate, these symmetries are exact. We illustrate the ubiquity of this phenomenon in various continuum and lattice systems and provide examples where the 't Hooft anomalies of the UV symmetry are matched by those of the new higher-form symmetry in the IR. We also show that in certain phases and for certain energies, the UV baryon-number symmetry of one-flavor QCD is transmuted into a discrete one-form global symmetry. Finally, we compare our symmetry transmutation to the well-known phenomenon of symmetry fractionalization.</description>

Abstract: We study the double cone geometry proposed by Saad, Shenker, and Stanford in de Sitter space. We demonstrate that with the inclusion of static patch observers, the double cone leads to a linear ramp consistent with random matrix behavior. This ramp arises from the relative time shift between two clocks located in opposite static patches.</description>

      <title>Time as a test-field: the no-boundary universe in motion and a smooth radiation bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review two arguments for using the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum cosmology and propose restricting to solutions in which time acts as a component with negligible backreaction on the metric - that is, it plays the role of a test field. We apply this idea to various minisuperspace models. In the semiclassical regime we recover expected results: the wavefunction peaks on the classical solution and, in models with a scalar field, the variance of $\zeta$ (a mini-superspace analogue of the comoving curvature perturbation) is conserved in time. Applied to the no-boundary wavefunction, our model highlights a bouncing behavior, which gives a straightforward quantum representation of global de Sitter space. We argue that the inevitable time dependence of the variance of the wavefunction breaks some of the classical de Sitter symmetries. Then, by modeling radiation as a fluid, we analyze the epoch of radiation domination near the singularity. The problem is equivalent to an $s$-wave scattering off a central power-law potential of the form $-r^{-2/3}$. Such a potential admits bound states, so the system is stable and the wavepacket undergoes unitary scattering. The radiation bounce, as opposed to the no-boundary bounce, does not have a classical counterpart as the corresponding classical solutions are singular. During the radiation bounce, the uncertainty and the expectation value of the scale factor become comparable. By selecting a large initial variance, the bounce can be made arbitrarily smooth, the mean value of the Hubble parameter correspondingly soft.</description>

      <title>Non-factorizable Superamplitudes for Massive N = 1 Superstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study non-factorizable N = 1 superamplitudes for massive chiral superstates. We demonstrate how little group scaling and the supersymmetric Ward identities determine the form of non-factorizable massless superamplitudes, then extrapolate to massive superamplitudes by requiring they reduce to the massless form when we send all masses to zero. This technique does not depend on whether or not the superstates are self-conjugate (so that the fermionic components are either Dirac or Majorana) or whether the superamplitude is dressed with a form-factor.</description>

      <title>Casimir Forces Across Magnetic Plasmas at Nuclear Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and numerical findings are presented on the magnetic Casimir interaction that arises from vacuum fluctuations of the quantized field and its effects at the nuclear scale. We investigate how the zero-temperature Casimir effect at nuclear scales can generate the black-body temperatures required to induce a magnetic electron-positron plasma. The magnetic permeability of the plasma and any magnetic fields present influence the screened Casimir-Yukawa potentials between perfect conducting surfaces. We discuss implications for the magnetic Casimir-Yukawa potential, its screening length, and a magnetic permeability-dependent quantity that resembles the meson mass.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with Pseudo-scalar couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflaton couplings during warm inflation result in the production of a thermal bath. Thermal friction and fluctuations can dominate the standard de Sitter analogues, resulting in a modified slow-roll scenario with a new source of density fluctuations. Due to issues with back-reaction, it is advantageous to consider inflaton couplings with the thermal bath that are pseudo-scalar in nature, e.g., derivative interactions or topological $F \tilde F$ couplings. We demonstrate that $\textit{ every single}$ existing model of warm inflation utilizing pseudo-scalar couplings needs to be corrected to account for the chemical potentials that the thermal bath acquires in response to the inflaton coupling. These chemical potentials are for non-conserved charges, and are non-zero only because of the applied inflaton couplings. The model-dependent chemical potentials modify the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, making the relationship between the thermal friction and thermal fluctuations model-dependent. In extreme cases, these chemical potentials can cause the friction term to vanish while thermal fluctuations remain non-zero. In the context of a simple example, we demonstrate how to calculate the chemical potentials, thermal friction, and thermal fluctuations using both the Boltzmann equations and by calculating thermal expectation values, showing explicitly that the two approaches give the same result.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar perturbations for a metric reconstructed from group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While homogeneous cosmologies have long been studied in the group field theory (GFT) approach to quantum gravity, including a quantum description of cosmological perturbations is highly non-trivial. Here we apply a recent proposal for reconstructing an effective spacetime metric in GFT to the case of a metric with small inhomogeneities over a homogeneous background. We detail the procedure and give general expressions for cosmological scalar perturbations defined in terms of the GFT energy-momentum tensor. These include all the scalar components of standard perturbation theory and hence can be used to define gauge-invariant quantities. We compute these perturbations explicitly for a particular Fock coherent state. While it was previously shown that such a state can be interpreted as an approximately flat homogeneous cosmology at late times, here we find that inhomogeneities do not follow the dynamics of general relativity in the semiclassical regime. More specifically, restricting ourselves to a specific coherent state in a simple (free) GFT, we study two types of perturbative GFT modes, squeezed and oscillating modes. For squeezed modes we find perturbation equations with Euclidean signature and a late-time limit that differs from general relativistic perturbation equations. Oscillating modes satisfy different dynamical equations that also differ from those of general relativity, but show a Lorentzian signature. Our analysis should be understood as a first step in understanding cosmological perturbations within the effective GFT metric.</description>

      <title>GUP Effective Metric Without GUP: Implications for the Sign of GUP Parameter and Quantum Bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) predicts that the Hawking temperature is modified near the Planck scale and that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy receives a logarithmic correction, consistent with other approaches to quantum gravity. However, due to the heuristic arguments in most GUP literature, it is not clear how to obtain the Schwarzschild metric that incorporates GUP correction. In this work, we try a different approach. We will start with the entropy expression with the standard logarithmic correction term, and use the recently proposed "generalized entropy and varying-G correspondence" (GEVAG) to obtain the associated metric. We show that the Hawking temperature obtained from this metric matches the GUP version. In this sense, we have derived in a consistent and reliable manner, a metric tensor that can describe the standard GUP physics, and use it to clarify some shortcomings in the heuristic GUP approach itself. In particular, if the strict Bekenstein bound is imposed, then the GUP parameter is negative. We also speculate on the possibility that instead of a stable remnant, the final stage of black hole evaporation could be a "bounce" due to an effective gravitational repulsion, once higher order corrections are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study we investigated the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions within a Finsler-Randers-type geometry. In this work we extend our analysis to charged and rotating solutions, focusing on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-like metrics in the Finsler-Randers gravitational framework. In particular, we extract the modified gravitational field equations and we examine the geodesic equations, analyzing particle trajectories and quantifying the deviations from their standard counterparts. Moreover, we compare the results with the predictions of general relativity, and we discuss how potential deviations from Riemannian geometry could be reached observationally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the LHCb observations of $P_c$ and $P_{cs}$ states, we systematically investigate the hidden-charm double-strange pentaquark system ($nssc\bar{c}$) using the resonating group method within the quark delocalization color screening model (QDCSM). By dynamically incorporating channel coupling effects, five resonance states are identified with $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. Their masses, widths, and dominant decay channels are predicted, providing critical guidance for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>What can solve the Strong CP problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three possible strategies have been advocated to solve the strong CP problem. The first is the axion, a dynamical mechanism that relaxes any initial value of the CP violating angle $\bar{\theta}$ to zero. The second is the imposition of new symmetries that are believed to set $\bar{\theta}$ to zero in the UV. The third is the acceptance of the fine tuning of parameters. We argue that the latter two solutions do not solve the strong CP problem. The $\theta$ term of QCD is not a parameter - it does not exist in the Hamiltonian. Rather, it is a property of the quantum state that our universe finds itself in, arising from the fact that there are CP violating states of a CP preserving Hamiltonian. It is not eliminated by imposing parity as a symmetry since the underlying theory is already parity symmetric and that does not preclude the existence of CP violating states. Moreover, since the value of $\theta$ realized in our universe is a consequence of measurement, it is inherently random and cannot be fine tuned by choice of parameters. Rather any fine tuning would require a tuning between parameters in the theory and the random outcome of measurement. Our results considerably strengthen the case for the existence of the axion and axion dark matter. The confusion around $\theta$ arises from the fact that unlike classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian are not equivalent in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian defines the differential time evolution, whereas the Lagrangian is a solution to this evolution. Consequently, initial conditions could in principle appear in the Lagrangian but not in the Hamiltonian. This results in aspects of the initial condition such as $\theta$ misleadingly appearing in the Lagrangian as parameters. We comment on the similarity between the $\theta$ vacua and the violations of the constraint equations of classical gauge theories in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A novel view of the flavor-singlet spectrum from multi-flavor QCD on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SU(3) gauge theories with increasing number of light fermions are the templates of strongly interacting sectors and studying their low-energy dynamics and spectrum is important, both for understanding the strong dynamics of QCD itself, but also for discovering viable UV completions of beyond the Standard Model physics. In order to contrast many-flavors strongly interacting theories with QCD on a quantitative footing, we use Lattice Field Theory simulations. We focus on the study of the flavor-singlet spectrum in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels: this is an interesting probe of the dynamics of the strongly interacting sector, as reminded by the QCD case with the $f_0(500)$ ($\sigma$) and $\eta^\prime$ mesons. The hierarchy of the spectrum of a strongly coupled new gauge sector of the Standard Model defines the potential reach of future colliders for new physics discoveries. In addition to a novel hierarchy with light scalars, introducing many light flavors at fixed number of colors can influence the dynamics of the lightest flavor-singlet pseudoscalar. We present a complete lattice study of both these flavor-singlet channels on high-statistics gauge ensembles generated by the LatKMI collaboration with 4, 8, and 12 copies of light mass-degenerate fermions. We also present other hadron masses on the lightest ensemble for $N_f=8$ generated by the LatKMI collaboration and discuss the chiral extrapolation of the spectrum in this particular theory. We contrast the results to $N_f=4$ simulations and previous results of $N_f=12$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational signatures of a nonlinear electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a nonlinear electrodynamics model within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity. We begin by outlining the general features of the theory and analyzing the event horizon under conditions ensuring its real and positive definiteness. We then examine light trajectories, focusing on critical orbits, shadow radii, and geodesics of massless particles. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, associated with the nonlinear extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, are constrained using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Subsequently, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. Quasinormal modes are computed for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial perturbations, with the corresponding time-domain profiles explored as well. Gravitational lensing is then studied in both weak and strong deflection limits, along with the stability of photon spheres. Finally, we examine additional topological aspects, including topological thermodynamics and the topological photon sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of two dimensional conformal ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric $U(1)$ gauge linear sigma models with $N$ fields of charges $+1$ and $N$ fields of charges $-1$, whose Higgs branches are non-compact toric Calabi-Yau manifolds of complex dimension $2N-1$. We show, starting from large-$N$ approximation, that the Coulomb branch of these models, which opens up at strong coupling, is described by ${\mathcal N}=2$ Liouville theory and then extrapolate it to exact equivalence demanding the central charge of the Liouville theory to be $\hat{c}=2N-1$. Next we concentrate on mostly physically attractive $N=2$ and $N \geq 3$ cases and find there a perfect agreement of the set of complex moduli on the Calabi-Yau side with the marginal deformations in ${\mathcal N}=2$ Liouville theory, supporting proposed exact equivalence.</description>

Abstract: A wealth of information on multiloop string amplitudes is encoded in fermionic two-point functions known as Szeg\"o kernels. In this paper we show that cyclic products of any number of Szeg\"o kernels on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus may be decomposed into linear combinations of modular tensors on moduli space that carry all the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. The $\delta$-independent coefficients in these combinations carry all the dependence on the marked points and are composed of the integration kernels of higher-genus polylogarithms. We determine the antiholomorphic moduli derivatives of the $\delta$-dependent modular tensors.</description>

      <title>Operator-state correspondence in simple current extended conformal field theories: Toward a general understanding of chiral conformal field theories and topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the operator-state correspondence in the Majorana conformal field theory (CFT) with emphasis on its semion representation. Whereas the semion representation (or $Z_{2}$ extension of the chiral Ising CFT) gives a concise ``abelian" (or invertible) representation in the level of fusion rule and quantum states, there exists subtlety when considering the chiral multipoint correlation function. In this sense, the operator-state correspondence in the semion sector of the fermionic theory inevitably contains difficulty coming from its anomalous conformal dimension $1/16$ as a $Z_{2}$ symmetry operator. By analyzing the asymptotic behaviors of the existing correlation functions, we propose a nontrivial correspondence between the chiral conformal blocks and bulk correlation functions containing both order and disorder fields. One can generalize this understanding to $Z_{N}$ models or fractional supersymmetric models (in which there exist long-standing open problems). We expect this may improve our understanding of the simple current extension of CFT which can appear commonly in the studies of topologically ordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holography of the new conformal higher spin theories imposing general boundary conditions and the near horizon boundary conditions. General boundary conditions lead to the asymptotic symmetry algebra which is a loop algebra of the underlying gauge algebra. The near horizon boundary conditions give u(1) currents at the boundary. For each of the boundary conditions we consider an example of conformal graviton, and its combination with a vector, and a spin-3 field, respectively. The near horizon boundary conditions lead to three dimensional Banados-Teitelboim- Zanelli (BTZ)-like black hole which can have up to four real eigenvalues, Lobachevsky solution, and to generalisation of that BTZ-like solution. We verify this result independently obtaining it from the Cotton tensor. We also consider the classification of the one parameter subgroups of the SO(3,2) and comment on the classification of the obtained solutions.</description>

      <title>How to define the moving frame of the Unruh-DeWitt detector on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB, to find factor 2 discrepancy from the standard result. Differential geometry is constructed in such a way that local calculations can be performed rigorously. If one expects Markov property, the calculation is expected to be local. The final piece that was missing was a local non-perturbative calculation, which is now complemented by the exact WKB. Our analysis defines a serious problem regarding the relationship between entanglement of the Unruh effect and differential geometry.</description>

Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Wiggly dilaton: a landscape of spontaneously broken scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dilaton emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) associated with the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in a nearly conformal field theory (CFT). We show the existence of a wiggly dilaton potential that contains multiple vacuum solutions in a five-dimensional (5D) holographic formulation. The wiggly feature originates from boundary potentials of a 5D axion-like scalar field, whose naturally small bulk mass parameter corresponds to a marginally-relevant deformation of the dual CFT. Depending on the energy density of a boundary 3-brane, our model can provide a relaxion potential or generate a light dilaton. However, an extremely light dilaton requires fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal indices from maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new gauging of maximal supergravity in five spacetime dimensions with gauge group containing ISO(5), involving the local scaling symmetry of the metric, and admitting a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum. We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>The AdS$_3\times $S$^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude with RR flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for scattering of dilatons in type IIB string theory with pure RR flux on $AdS_3\times S^3\times M_4$ for $M_4=T^4$ or $K3$, to all orders in $\alpha'$ in a small AdS curvature expansion. This is achieved by comparing the flat space limit of the dual D1D5 CFT correlator to an ansatz for the amplitude as a worldsheet integral in terms of single valued multiple polylogarithms. The first curvature correction is fully fixed in this way, and satisfies consistency checks in the high energy limit, and by comparison of the energy of massive string operators to a semiclassical expansion. Our result gives infinite predictions for CFT data in the planar limit at strong coupling, which can guide future integrability studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize off-shell, local and gauge invariant $N=8$ supergravity in $D=4$, to cubic order in fields, as the double copy of $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory (SYM). Employing the homotopy algebra approach, we show that, thanks to a redundant formulation for the fermionic fields, the kinematic algebra $K$ of $N=4$ SYM is compatible with an action of the global supersymmetry algebra. The double copy space is then a subspace of $K\otimes{\widetilde K}$ that inherits an $L_{\infty}$ algebra on which the two copies of the $N=4$ action combine into an action of the $N=8$ supersymmetry algebra, with a corresponding enhancement of the $R$-symmetry group to $SU(8)$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Triple Point of Noncommutative Matrix Model with Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Hermitian matrix model with a quartic potential, modified by a curvature term $\mathrm{tr}(R\Phi^2)$, where $R$ is a fixed external matrix. Motivated by the truncated Heisenberg algebra formulation of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, this term breaks unitary invariance and gives rise to an effective multitrace matrix model via perturbative expansion. We analyze the resulting action analytically and numerically, focusing on the shift of the triple point and suppression of the noncommutative stripe phase -- features linked to renormalizability. Our findings, supported by Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the curvature term drives the phase structure toward renormalizable behavior by eliminating the stripe phase.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle creation from $T-$vacuum in the radiation dominated universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further investigate novel features of the $T-$vacuum state, originally defined in the context of quantum field theory in a (1+1) dimensional radiation dominated universe [Modak, JHEP 12, 031 (2020)]. Here we extend the previous work to a realistic (3+1) dimensional set up and show that $T-$vacuum gives rise to an anisotropic particle creation phenomena in the radiation dominated early universe. Unlike the Hawking or Unruh effect, where the particle content is thermal and asymptotically defined, here it is non-thermal and instantaneous. This novel example of particle creation is interesting because these particles are detected in the frame of physical/cosmological observers, who envision $T-$vacuum as a particle excited state. Such results comes with a potential to be eventually compared with the observed anisotropies from the early universe and may provide new insights on cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <title>Dissipation driven phase transition in the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians capture several aspects of open quantum systems, such as dissipation of energy and non-unitary evolution. An example is an optical lattice where the inelastic scattering between the two orbital mobile atoms in their ground state and the atom in a metastable excited state trapped at a particular site and acting as an impurity, results in the two body losses. It was shown in \cite{nakagawa2018non} that this effect is captured by the non-Hermitian Kondo model. which was shown to exhibit two phases depending on the strength of losses. When the losses are weak, the system exhibits the Kondo phase and when the losses are stronger, the system was shown to exhibit the unscreened phase where the Kondo effect ceases to exist, and the impurity is left unscreened. We re-examined this model using the Bethe Ansatz and found that in addition to the above two phases, the system exhibits a novel $\widetilde{YSR}$ phase which is present between the Kondo and the unscreened phases. The model is characterized by two renormalization group invariants, a generalized Kondo temperature $T_K$ and a parameter `$\alpha$' that measures the strength of the loss. The Kondo phase occurs when the losses are weak which corresponds to $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi/2$. As $\alpha$ approaches $\pi/2$, the Kondo cloud shrinks resulting in the formation of a single particle bound state which screens the impurity in the ground state between $\pi/2&lt;\alpha&lt;\pi$. As $\alpha$ increases, the impurity is unscreened in the ground state but can be screened by the localized bound state for $\pi&lt;\alpha&lt;3\pi/2$. When $\alpha&gt;3\pi/2$, one enters the unscreened phase where the impurity cannot be screened. We argue that in addition to the energetics, the system displays different time scales associated with the losses across $\alpha=\pi/2$, resulting in a phase transition driven by the dissipation in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using M\"obius-redefined time. It can either transform a globally defined vacuum wave into a vacuum sandwich wave, or carry the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, permutes the symmetries and the geodesics. Our pp waves with conformal O(2,1) symmetry of the second type, which seem to ahve escaped attention so far, are anisotropic generalizations of the familiar inverse-square profile. An example inspired by molecular physics, for which the particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity is studied in detail.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles initially at rest hit by a passing sandwich gravitational wave exhibit, in general, thevelocity memory effect (VM): they fly apart with constant velocity. For specific values of the wave parameters their motion can however become pure displacement (DM) as suggested by Zel'dovich and Polnarev. For such a ``miraculous'' value, the particle trajectory is composed of an integer number of (approximate) standing half-waves. Our statements are illustrated numerically by a Gaussian, and analytically by the P\"oschl-Teller profiles.</description>

Abstract: Zel'dovich and Polnarev, in their seminal paper [1] suggested that a gravitational wave generated by flyby would merely displace the particles. We confirm their prediction numerically by fine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then analytically for its approximation by a P\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $2\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $(20-700)\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks viewpoint for solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed to solve the Dyson--Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space, with a focus on the non-perturbative generation of the fermion's dynamical mass function in the Landau gauge. By inserting the integral equation directly into the loss function, our PINN framework enables a single neural network to learn a continuous and differentiable representation of the mass function over a spectrum of momenta. Also, we benchmark our approach against a traditional numerical algorithm showing the main differences among them. Our novel strategy, which is expected to be extended to other quantum field theories, is the first step towards forefront applications of machine learning in high-level theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider not necessarily Lagrangian partial linear differential equations (PDE) with constant coefficients. Einstein proposed a definition of the"strength" of such a field theory that defines its degree of freedom (DoF). Einsteinian strength is based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the PDE system. The direct count of DoF in this way is a complex and technically demanding process. Proceeding from Einsteinian strength of equations and making use of commutative algebra tools, we deduce another DoF count recipe which is formulated in terms of orders of the field equations, their gauge symmetries and gauge identities. This DoF count recipe covers the case of reducible gauge field theories, and it is easy to use. We begin with interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, proceeding from Einsteinian definition, we derive an explicit formula for DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove another explicit formula for DoF in terms of orders of equations and gauge generators. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. Every classical field theory defines the BRST complex which has the natural grading known as the ghost number. We equip this complex with another grading, which we call differential order. This grading is 1 for every space time-derivative, while all thefields, ghosts, and antifields are assigned with this degree in a certain way, depending on their ghost number and the orders of equations and gauge generators. We compute the Euler characteristic of the BRST complex with respect to this new grading. This provides homological interpretation of DoF for linear gauge system as minus the residue at infinity of the logarithmic derivative of the Euler characteristics for its BRST complex.</description>

Abstract: A set of lattice operators for the energy-momentum (EM) tensor in the Ising CFT is derived in the spin variables. Our expression works under arbitrary affine transformation both on triangular and hexagonal lattices (where the former includes the rectangular lattices). The correctness of the operators is numerically confirmed in Monte Carlo calculations by comparing the results with the conformal Ward identity, including the operator normalization. In the derivation of the EM tensor, a staggered structure of the affine-transformed hexagonal lattice is analyzed, which shows a peculiar shift from the circumcenter dual lattice and appears as a mixing angle between the holomorphic part $T(z)$ and the antiholomorphic part $\tilde T(\bar z)$. The details of this contribution will appear in a subsequent paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

Abstract: We compute scalar products of off-shell Bethe vectors in models with $o_{2n+1}$ symmetry. The scalar products are expressed as a sum over partitions of the Bethe parameter sets, the building blocks being the so-called highest coefficients. We prove some recurrence relations and a residue theorem for these highest coefficients, and prove that they are consistent with the reduction to $gl_n$ invariant models. We also express the norm of on-shell Bethe vectors as a Gaudin determinant.</description>

Abstract: We consider isotropic and Lagrangian embeddings of coadjoint orbits of compact Lie groups into products of coadjoint orbits. After reviewing the known facts in the case of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ we initiate a similar study for $\mathrm{SO}$ and $\mathrm{Sp}$ cases. In the second part we apply this to the study of dynamical systems with $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ symmetry, proving equivalence between systems of two types: those describing magnetic geodesic flow on flag manifolds and classical `spin chains' of a special type.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Time Advance and Probability Conservation in PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that $V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all. An effect of this form together with an associated negative time delay appear to have recently been reported by Sinclair et. al., PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 010314 (2022) and Angulo et. al., arXiv:2409.03680 [quant-ph].</description>

Abstract: We study quantum phases of a fluid of mobile charged non-abelian anyons, which arise upon doping the lattice Moore-Read quantum Hall state at lattice filling $\nu = 1/2$ and its generalizations to the Read-Rezayi ($\mathrm{RR}_k$) sequence at $\nu = k/(k+2)$. In contrast to their abelian counterparts, non-abelian anyons present unique challenges due to their non-invertible fusion rules and non-abelian braiding structures. We address these challenges using a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau (CSGL) framework that incorporates the crucial effect of energy splitting between different anyon fusion channels at nonzero dopant density. For the Moore-Read state, we show that doping the charge $e/4$ non-abelion naturally leads to a fully gapped charge-$2$ superconductor without any coexisting topological order. The chiral central charge of the superconductor depends on details of the interactions determining the splitting of anyon fusion channels. For general $\mathrm{RR}_k$ states, our analysis of states obtained by doping the basic non-abelion $a_0$ with charge $e/(k+2)$ reveals a striking even/odd pattern in the Read-Rezayi index $k$. We develop a general physical picture for anyon-driven superconductivity based on charge-flux unbinding, and show how it relates to the CSGL description of doped abelian quantum Hall states. Finally, as a bonus, we use the CSGL formalism to describe transitions between the $\mathrm{RR}_k$ state and a trivial period-$(k+2)$ CDW insulator at fixed filling, driven by the gap closure of the fundamental non-abelian anyon $a_0$. Notably, for $k=2$, this predicts a period-4 CDW neighboring the Moore-Read state at half-filling, offering a potential explanation of recent numerical observations in models of twisted MoTe$_2$.</description>
