      <title>Optimal control approach to Olympic weightlifting exercise: Minimal model of the snatch pull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the biomechanical aspects of Olympic weightlifting within the framework of optimal control theory. The squared force and the rate of force development (RFD) defined by the time derivative of the force are taken into account in the evaluation functions of the first and second pull phases of the snatch motion. Focusing on the vertical trajectory of the barbell, we develop a minimal model to describe the mechanical characteristics of the weightlifting exercise. The calculated barbell trajectory agrees well with the experimental data obtained by video analysis. Our study would be useful for the further development of mathematical models for weightlifting motions and related exercises.</description>

      <title>Mechanics as a general-relativistic gauge field theory, and Relational Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat Mechanics as a 1-dimensional general-relativistic gauge field theory, Mechanical Field Theory (MFT), introducing what we call the Mechanical Field Space (MFS) and exploiting its bundle geometry. The diffeomorphism covariance of MFT encodes its relational character, arising - as in all general-relativistic physics - via the conjunction of a hole and point-coincidence arguments. Any putative "boundary problem", meaning the claim that boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries, thereby dissolves. It is highlighted that the standard path integral (PI) on the MFS, the exact analogue of the PI used in gauge field theory, is conceptually and technically distinct from the standard PI of Quantum Mechanics.
  We then use the Dressing Field Method to give a manifestly invariant and relational reformulation of MFT, which reproduces the standard textbook formulation when a clock field is chosen as a (natural) dressing field. The dressed, or basic, PI on the MFS, defining Relational Quantization - i.e. the quantization of invariant relational d.o.f. - is shown to reproduce the standard PI of Quantum Mechanics. This establishes the soundness of Relational Quantization as a general guiding principle: We outline it for general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Light Propagation in $\kappa$-Minkowski Space-Time: Gauge Ambiguities and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory on the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time at the semiclassical approximation. We construct exact solutions of the deformed Maxwell equations in vacuum, describing localized signals propagating in a given direction. The propagation velocity appears to be arbitrary. We figure out that the wave packets with different values of the propagation velocity are related by noncommutative gauge transformations. Moreover, we show that spatial distances between particles are gauge-dependent as well. We explain how these two gauge dependencies compensate each other, recovering gauge invariance of measurement results. According to our analysis, the gauge ambiguity of the speed of light can be absorbed into a redefinition of the unit of length and, therefore, cannot be measured experimentally.</description>

      <title>Supersonic and Superluminal Energy and Speed of Information via Temporal Interference in a Dispersionless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical implementation of a theory yields acoustic wave packets whose peak-to-peak speeds, $c_{3d}$, are supersonic in a dispersionless medium due to temporal interference between direct and boundary-reflected paths. The effect occurs when the source and receiver are near each other and at least one is within $c\tilde{\delta t}/2$ of the boundary, where $c$ is the phase speed of propagation in the medium, and $\tilde{\delta t}$ is the smallest temporal separation between the paths at which interference first occurs. This direct+reflected path effect is distinct from previously-observed superluminal occurrence of group speeds due to anomalous dispersion, quantum tunneling, and cavity vacuum fluctuations. For temporally interfering direct+reflected paths, simulations yield a speed of information less than $c$, though no proof exists $c$ cannot be exceeded. The speed of information from the interfering paths can exceed the speed derived from propagation only along the direct path. We conjecture these results will also hold for electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation, and so the effect may not violate special relativity. These theoretical and simulation results, as well as their conjectured EM extension, should be readily accessible to experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Theory for Quantum Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13436v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (or quantum spacetime) is to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single theoretical framework and presented as the most important open puzzle in fundamental physics. The development of a microscopic theory of quantum spacetime becomes the key problem about quantum gravity. This paper is the solution to this problem. The starting point of this paper is very simple -- physical variant with higher-order variability (see the below discussion). Based on this simple starting point, a microscopic theory for quantum spacetime is developed, including its matrix representation for quantum states, its time evolution, its geometry quantization, its generalized symmetry, its canonical quantization, and the uncertainty principle, black hole, AdS/CFT correspondence, scattering amplitudes of gravitons... The result leads to a great unification of matter and spacetime -- the particles constitute the basic blocks of spacetime and spacetime is really a multi-particle system that is made of matter. As a result, this work would help researchers to understand the mysteries in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics -- A Theory of Dynamics for "Space" on Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Till now, the foundation of quantum physics is still mysterious. To explore the mysteries in the foundation of quantum physics, people always take it for granted that quantum processes must be some types of fields/objects on a rigid space. In this paper, we give a new idea that the space is no more rigid and the matter is the certain changing of "space" itself rather than extra things on it. Based on this starting point, we develop a new framework based on quantum and classical mechanics. Now, physical laws emerge from different changings of regular changings on spacetime. Then, both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics become phenomenological theories and are interpreted by using the concepts of the microscopic properties of a single physical framework. The expanding/contracting dynamics of "space" leads to quantum physics. In addition, when we consider a physical variant with 2-th order variability, quantum fields with gauge structure emerge. The 2-th order variability is reduced into U(1) local gauge symmetry and SU(N) non-Abelian gauge symmetry. The corresponding theory becomes QED and QCD. The belief of "symmetry induce interaction" is now updates to "Higher order variability induce interaction". After introducing chirality, a physical variant with 2-th order variability becomes the true physical reality of our universe. The low energy effective theory is just the Standard model -- an SU(3)*SU(2)*U(1) gauge theory. An important progress is about hidden topological structure for elementary particles of different generations -- chiral para-statistics. In particular, to obtain the entire mass spectra, we only need to use only one free parameter. This progress on the foundation of quantum physics will have a far-reaching impact on modern physics in the future.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Cartan cosmology and the S8 problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurements of cluster abundances, gravitational lensings, redshift space distortions and peculiar velocities at lower redshifts point out to much smaller sigma_8 than its value deduced from the measurements of the CMB fluctuations assuming the standard LCDM cosmology. High redshift measurements of ALMA and JWST imply even more striking problems for LCDM. We examine and compare the sigma_8 redshift dependence calculated within the gauge invariant formalism. Because the CMB fluctuations comprise a cosmological data from the recombination era to the present, the S_8 problem of the LCDM cosmology is not a surprise from the standpoint of the Einstein-Cartan cosmology because it predicts much larger mass density and sigma_8(z) than the LCDM model at high redshifts.</description>
