      <title>SIM-Enabled Hybrid Digital-Wave Beamforming for Fronthaul-Constrained Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays (LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover, the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in most simulated cases, except in the downlink at low signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Challenge: From Cross-Task to Cross-Subject EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges. First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second, the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128 channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.</description>

      <title>From High-SNR Radar Signal to ECG: A Transfer Learning Model with Cardio-Focusing Algorithm for Scenarios with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are available after the publication.</description>

      <title>Holographic Communication via Recordable and Reconfigurable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic surface based communication technologies are anticipated to play a significant role in the next generation of wireless networks. The existing reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-based scheme only utilizes the reconstruction process of the holographic principle for beamforming, where the channel sate information (CSI) is needed. However, channel estimation for CSI acquirement is a challenging task in metasurface based communications. In this study, inspired by both the recording and reconstruction processes of holography, we develop a novel holographic communication scheme by introducing recordable and reconfigurable metasurfaces (RRMs), where channel estimation is not needed thanks to the recording process. Then we analyze the input-output mutual information of the RRM-based communication system and compare it with the existing RHS based system. Our results show that, without channel estimation, the proposed scheme achieves performance comparable to that of the RHS scheme with perfect CSI, suggesting a promising alternative for future wireless communication networks.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Lookahead Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity. Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity, demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent and Noncoherent Detection in Dense Arrays: Can We Ignore Mutual Coupling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of mutual coupling on MIMO systems with densely deployed antennas. Leveraging multiport communication theory, we analyze both coherent and noncoherent detection approaches in a single-user uplink scenario where the receiver ignores mutual coupling effects. Simulation results indicate that while coherent detection is generally more accurate, it is highly sensitive to mismatches in the coupling model, leading to severe performance degradation when antennas are closely spaced, to the point of becoming unusable. Noncoherent detection, on the other hand, exhibits a higher error probability but is more robust to coupling model mismatches.</description>

      <title>Neural Collapse based Deep Supervised Federated Learning for Signal Detection in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to be AI-empowered, making their performance highly dependent on the quality of training datasets. However, physical-layer entities often observe only partial wireless environments characterized by different power delay profiles. Federated learning is capable of addressing this limited observability, but often struggles with data heterogeneity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a neural collapse (NC) inspired deep supervised federated learning (NCDSFL) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of A Framework for In-body RF-backscattering Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of in-body devices is beneficial for Gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis and targeted treatment. Traditional methods such as imaging and endoscopy are invasive and limited in resolution, highlighting the need for innovative alternatives. This study presents an experimental framework for Radio Frequency (RF)-backscatter-based in-body localization, inspired by the ReMix approach, and evaluates its performance in real-world conditions. The experimental setup includes an in-body backscatter device and various off-body antenna configurations to investigate harmonic generation and reception in air, chicken and pork tissues. The results indicate that optimal backscatter device positioning, antenna selection, and gain settings significantly impact performance, with denser biological tissues leading to greater attenuation. The study also highlights challenges such as external interference and plastic enclosures affecting propagation. The findings emphasize the importance of interference mitigation and refined propagation models to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey from Theory to Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the wireless research community moves toward shaping the vision of sixth-generation (6G) networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a promising technology for controlling the propagation environment. Although RIS has not yet been standardized, its versatile applications and enabling capabilities have attracted growing attention in both academia and industry. This survey presents a comprehensive review of RIS technology spanning theoretical foundations, design aspects, and practical deployment considerations. In contrast to existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects, this work offers an integrated view covering use cases, control mechanisms, channel sounding methodologies, and channel estimation strategies. Each of these topics is reviewed through the lens of recent literature, synthesizing the latest advancements to provide updated insights for both academic researchers and industry practitioners. It further addresses emerging topics such as standardization activities and industrial perspectives, which are often overlooked in prior literature. By bridging theoretical insights with practical challenges, this survey aims to provide a holistic understanding of RIS and support its evolution from a research concept toward real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>A Wireless Self-Calibrating Ultrasound Microphone Array with Sub-Microsecond Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel system architecture for a distributed wireless, self-calibrating ultrasound microphone network for synchronized in-air acoustic sensing. Once deployed the embedded nodes determine their position in the environment using the infrared optical tracking system found in the HTC Vive Lighthouses. After self-calibration, the nodes start sampling the ultrasound microphone while embedding a synchronization signal in the data which is established using a wireless Sub-1GHz RF link. Data transmission is handled via the Wi-Fi 6 radio that is embedded in the nodes' SoC, decoupling synchronization from payload transport. A prototype system with a limited amount of network nodes was used to verify the proposed distributed microphone array's wireless data acquisition and synchronization capabilities. This architecture lays the groundwork for scalable, deployable ultrasound arrays for sound source localization applications in bio-acoustic research and industrial acoustic monitoring.</description>

      <title>On Error Rate Approximations for FSO Systems with Weak Turbulence and Pointing Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric attenuation, atmospheric turbulence, geometric spread, and pointing errors, degrade the performance of free-space optical transmission. In the weak turbulence regime, the probability density function describing the distribution of the channel fading coefficient that models these four effects is known in the literature. This function is an integral equation, which makes it difficult to find simple analytical expressions of important performance metrics such as the bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER). In this paper, we present simple and accurate approximations of the average BER and SER for pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in the weak turbulence regime for an intensity modulation and direct detection system. Our numerical results show that the proposed expressions exhibit excellent accuracy when compared against Monte Carlo simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed approximations, we perform two asymptotic analyses. First, we investigate the additional transmit power required to maintain the same SER when the spectral efficiency increases by 1 bit/symbol. Second, we study the asymptotic behavior of our SER approximation for dense PAM constellations and high transmit power.</description>

      <title>Beyond 200 Gb/s/lane: An Analytical Approach to Optimal Detection in Shaped IM-DD Optical Links with Relative Intensity Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation intensity-modulation (IM) and direct-detection (DD) systems used in data centers are expected to operate at 400 Gb/s/lane and beyond. Such rates can be achieved by increasing the system bandwidth or the modulation format, which in turn requires maintaining or increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Such SNR requirements can be achieved by increasing the transmitted optical power. This increase in optical power causes the emergence of relative intensity noise (RIN), a signal-dependent impairment inherent to the transmitter laser, which ultimately limits the performance of the system. In this paper, we develop an analytical symbol error rate (SER) expression for the optimal detector for the IM-DD optical link under study. The developed expression takes into account the signal-dependent nature of RIN and does not make any assumptions on the geometry or probability distribution of the constellation. Our expression is therefore applicable to general probabilistically and/or geometrically shaped systems. Unlike results available in the literature, our proposed expression provides a perfect match to numerical simulations of probabilistic and geometrically shaped systems.</description>

      <title>Tangent Space Causal Inference: Leveraging Vector Fields for Causal Discovery in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery with time series data remains a challenging yet increasingly important task across many scientific domains. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) and related methods have been proposed to study time series that are generated by dynamical systems, where traditional approaches like Granger causality are unreliable. However, CCM often yields inaccurate results depending upon the quality of the data. We propose the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI) method for detecting causalities in dynamical systems. TSCI works by considering vector fields as explicit representations of the systems' dynamics and checks for the degree of synchronization between the learned vector fields. The TSCI approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a drop-in replacement for CCM and its generalizations. We first present a basic version of the TSCI algorithm, which is shown to be more effective than the basic CCM algorithm with very little additional computation. We additionally present augmented versions of TSCI that leverage the expressive power of latent variable models and deep learning. We validate our theory on standard systems, and we demonstrate improved causal inference performance across a number of benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Imaging for Damage Detection in Plates Based on Topological Acoustic (TA) Sensing Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional structural damage detection methods in aerospace applications face challenges in accuracy and sensitivity, often necessitating multiple sensors to evaluate various measurement paths between the reference and defective states. However, the recently developed topological acoustic (TA) sensing technique can capture shifts in the geometric phase of an acoustic field, enabling the detection of even minor perturbations in the supporting medium. In this study, a diagnostic imaging method for damage detection in plate structures based on the TA sensing technique is presented. The method extracts the geometric phase shift index (GPS-I) from the Lamb wave response signals to indicate the location of the damage. Using Abaqus/CAE, a finite element model of the plate was established to simulate the Lamb wave response signals, which were then used to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that this technique enables rapid and precise identification of damage and its location within the plate structure, requiring response signals from only a few points on the damaged plate, and it is reference-free.</description>

      <title>A Robust Method for Pitch Tracking in the Frequency Following Response using Harmonic Amplitude Summation Filterbank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Frequency Following Response (FFR) reflects the brain's neural encoding of auditory stimuli including speech. Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a physical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there has been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when F0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the Autocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates harmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for speech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in two steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs is already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively aggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at non-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation (HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus F0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak, our method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying periodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure. Analyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech stimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method outperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within each response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the stimulus.</description>

      <title>Deep Electromagnetic Structure Design Under Limited Evaluation Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product designing cycle.</description>

      <title>Can Movable Antenna-enabled Micro-Mobility Replace UAV-enabled Macro-Mobility? A Physical Layer Security Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of movable antenna (MA)-enabled micro-mobility to replace UAV-enabled macro-mobility for enhancing physical layer security (PLS) in air-to-ground communications. While UAV trajectory optimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it suffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory optimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial reconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low energy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel manipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these paradigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted uniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential information to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems for both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna positions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2) UAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF vectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct operational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages in low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its energy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under resource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by leveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the complementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro mobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency, and deployment complexity in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of OAMP Detection for ODDM Modulation in Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards future 6G wireless networks, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been widely considered as a promising component to enhance the terrestrial communications. To ensure the link reliability of high-mobility satellite communication scenarios, the emerging orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has attracted significant research attention. In this paper, we study the diversity gain achieved by ODDM modulation along with the mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. Additionally, we propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm based detector to harvest the diversity gain promised by ODDM modulation. By operating the linear and non-linear estimator iteratively, the orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) detector can utilize the sparsity of the effective delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel and extract the full diversity. Simulation results reveal the relationship between diversity gain and system parameters, and demonstrate that our proposed detector can achieve better performance than the conventional message passing methods with significantly reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Scheduling schemes based on Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced and their improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper I focused on resource scheduling in the downlink of LTE-Advanced with aggregation of multiple Component Carriers (CCs). When Carrier Aggregation (CA) is applied, a well-designed resource scheduling scheme is essential to the LTE-A system. Joint User Scheduling (JUS), Separated Random User Scheduling (SRUS), Separated Burst-Level Scheduling (SBLS) are three different resource scheduling schemes. JUS is optimal in performance but with high complexity and not considering quality of experience (QoE) parameters. Whereas SRUS and SBLS are contrary and users will acquire few resources because they do not support CA and the system fairness is disappointing. The author propose a novel Carrier Scheduling (CS) scheme, termed as "Quality of Service and Channel Scheduling" (QSCS). Connected CCs of one user can be changed in burst level and these changes are based on checking of services priority and quality of signal that user experiences. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance throughput of users like JUS and also it chooses best CCs based on QoS and channel quality parameters. The simulation results also show that achieved QoE is much better than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>ECG-SMART-NET: A Deep Learning Architecture for Precise ECG Diagnosis of Occlusion Myocardial Infarction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: In this paper we develop and evaluate ECG-SMART-NET for occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) identification. OMI is a severe form of heart attack characterized by complete blockage of one or more coronary arteries requiring immediate referral for cardiac catheterization to restore blood flow to the heart. Two thirds of OMI cases are difficult to visually identify from a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and can be potentially fatal if not identified quickly. Previous works on this topic are scarce, and current state-of-the-art evidence suggests both feature-based random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising approaches to improve ECG detection of OMI. Methods: While the ResNet architecture has been adapted for use with ECG recordings, it is not ideally suited to capture informative temporal features within each lead and the spatial concordance or discordance across leads. We propose a clinically informed modification of the ResNet-18 architecture. The model first learns temporal features through temporal convolutional layers with 1xk kernels followed by a spatial convolutional layer, after the residual blocks, with 12x1 kernels to learn spatial features. Results: ECG-SMART-NET was benchmarked against the original ResNet-18 and other state-of-the-art models on a multisite real-word clinical dataset that consists of 10,393 ECGs from 7,397 unique patients (rate of OMI =7.2%). ECG-SMART-NET outperformed other models in the classification of OMI with a test AUC of 0.953 [0.921, 0.978]. Conclusion and Significance: ECG-SMART-NET can outperform the state-of-the-art random forest for OMI prediction and is better suited for this task than the original ResNet-18 architecture.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Enabled Distributed Image Transmission with Imperfect Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with robust distributed multi-view image transmission over a severe fading channel with imperfect channel state information (CSI), wherein the sources are slightly correlated. Since the signals are further distorted at the decoder, traditional distributed deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) suffers considerable performance degradation. To tackle this problem, we leverage the complementarity and consistency characteristics among the distributed, yet correlated sources, and propose an enhanced robust DJSCC, namely RDJSCC. In RDJSCC, we design a novel cross-view information extraction (CVIE) mechanism to capture more nuanced cross-view patterns and dependencies. In addition, a complementarity-consistency fusion (CCF) mechanism is utilized to fuse the complementarity and consistency from multi-view information in a symmetric and compact manner. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed RDJSCC can effectively leverage the advantages of correlated sources even under severe fading conditions, leading to an improved reconstruction performance. The open source code of this work is available at:https://dongbiao26.github.io/rdjscc/.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Optimization for Coexisting Semantic and Bit-Based Users in NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications, which focus on transmitting the semantic meaning of data, have been proposed as a novel paradigm for achieving efficient and relevant communication. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enhances spectral efficiency by allowing multiple users to share the same spectrum. However, semantic communications are unlikely to fully replace conventional bit-level communications in the near future, as the latter remain dominant. Therefore, integrating semantic users into a NOMA network alongside conventional bit-based users becomes a meaningful approach to improve both transmission and spectrum efficiency. Nonetheless, due to the lack of a mathematical model that accurately characterizes the relationship between the performance of semantic transceivers and wireless resource allocation, enhancing performance through resource optimization remains a challenge. Moreover, successive interference cancellation (SIC), a key technique in NOMA, introduces additional complexity in system design and implementation. To address these challenges, this paper first improves the deep semantic communication (DeepSC) transceiver to make it adaptive to varying wireless transmission conditions. Subsequently, a data-driven regression approach is employed to develop a mathematical model that captures the impact of wireless resources on semantic transceiver performance. In parallel, a multi-cluster hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA) framework is proposed, where each cluster consists of one semantic user and one bit-based user, to mitigate the complexity introduced by SIC. A total transmit power minimization problem is then formulated by jointly optimizing the beamforming design, bandwidth allocation, and semantic symbol factor.</description>

      <title>A New Pathway to Integrated Learning and Communication (ILAC): Large AI Model and Hyperdimensional Computing for Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks necessitates the seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with wireless communications to support emerging intelligent applications that demand both efficient communication and robust learning performance. This dual requirement calls for a unified framework of integrated learning and communication (ILAC), where AI enhances communication through intelligent signal processing and adaptive resource management, while wireless networks support AI model deployment by enabling efficient and reliable data exchanges. However, achieving this integration presents significant challenges in practice. Communication constraints, such as limited bandwidth and fluctuating channels, hinder learning accuracy and convergence. Simultaneously, AI-driven learning dynamics, including model updates and task-driven inference, introduce excessive burdens on communication systems, necessitating flexible, context-aware transmission strategies. Finally, we present a case study on a cost-to-performance optimization problem, where task assignments, model size selection, bandwidth allocation, and transmission power control are jointly optimized, considering computational cost, communication efficiency, and inference accuracy. Leveraging the Dinkelbach and alternating optimization algorithms, we offer a practical and effective solution to achieve an optimal balance between learning performance and communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Densify &amp; Conquer: Densified, smaller base-stations can conquer the increasing carbon footprint problem in nextG wireless</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector's carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly and independently alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the boresight directions of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal boresight directions of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain than the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multipath channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is proposed to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly improve the communication performance as compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS) is a new promising IRS architecture for which the reflection matrix is not limited to the diagonal structure as for conventional IRS. In this paper, we study a BD-IRS aided uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where sensing is performed in a device-based manner. Specifically, we aim to estimate the unknown and random location of an active target based on its uplink probing signals sent to a multi-antenna base station (BS) as well as the known prior distribution information of the target's location. Multiple communication users also simultaneously send uplink signals, resulting in a challenging mutual interference issue between sensing and communication. We first characterize the sensing performance metric by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) when prior information is available. Then, we formulate a BD-IRS reflection matrix optimization problem to maximize the minimum expected achievable rate among the multiple users subject to a constraint on the PCRB as well as the lossless and reciprocal constraints on the BD-IRS reflection matrix. The formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm which can find a high-quality suboptimal solution with polynomial-time complexity. In addition, we propose and optimize a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based scheme which removes the sensing-communication mutual interference. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed designs and provide useful design insights such as the optimal choice of multiple access scheme.</description>
