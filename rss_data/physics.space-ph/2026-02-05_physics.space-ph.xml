      <title>Where Does Tracing of Cosmic Ray in Real Atmosphere Terminate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In backtracing simulations, which are widely employed to determine cosmic-ray particle trajectories in the geomagnetic field, the atmosphere is typically approximated as an artificial sharp boundary at some low altitude where the traced trajectory terminates. In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\sim0.57$~GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\langle N\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\exp(-0.14h/\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}+\langle N\rangle\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron.</description>

      <title>Effects of the May 2024 Solar Storm on the Earth's Radiation Belts Observed by CALET on the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2024, extraordinary solar activity triggered a powerful solar storm, impacting Earth and producing the extreme geomagnetic storm of May 10-11, the most intense since 2003. This had significant effects on the magnetosphere, leading to the creation of a new long-lasting component of relativistic electrons and to flux changes in the South-Atlantic Anomaly. Here we present radiation-belt observations made by the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) on the International Space Station. Specifically, we took advantage of the count rates from three layers of the CALET charge detector and imaging calorimeter. We show that the new electron storage ring extended to energies in the multi-MeV range and down to L=2.2, well below the nominal slot-region barrier of L=2.8, and persisted for several months, depending on energy. The evolution of the new radiation-belt configuration over time was characterized by estimating the decay rates as a function of energy and L.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Ray Lines -- Signatures of Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Rays, Positron Annihilation, and Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear $\gamma$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $\gamma$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $\gamma$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $\gamma$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.</description>

      <title>Observations of Transition from Imbalanced to Balanced Kinetic Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of solar wind turbulence derived from measurements by the Parker Solar Probe. Our findings reveal the emergence of finite magnetic helicity within the transition range of the turbulence, aligning with signatures of kinetic Alfv\'en waves (KAWs). Notably, as the wave scale transitions from super-ion to sub-ion scales, the ratio of KAWs with opposing signs of magnetic helicity initially increases from approximately 1 to 6.5 before returning to 1. This observation provides, for the first time, compelling evidence for the transition from imbalanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence to balanced kinetic Alfv\'enic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: experimental implementation and microdosimetric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13158v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Active-Passive Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: in-silico design and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy heavy-ion particle accelerators have long served as proxies for the harsh space radiation environment, enabling both fundamental life-science research and applied testing of flight hardware. Traditionally, monoenergetic high-energy heavy-ion beams have been employed for practicality, providing valuable datasets that underpin radiation risk and predictive computational models. However, such beams cannot fully reproduce the mixed-field nature of space radiation, motivating the development of realistic analogs for improved risk assessment and countermeasure evaluation in preparation for future deep-space missions to Moon or Mars. Spearheaded by developments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung, supported by the European Space Agency (ESA), has established advanced space radiation simulation capabilities in Europe. Here, we present the design, optimization, and in-silico benchmarking of GSI's hybrid active-passive Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) simulator, together with a computationally optimized phase-space particle source for Geant4, which is available to external users for their own simulation studies and experimental planning.</description>
