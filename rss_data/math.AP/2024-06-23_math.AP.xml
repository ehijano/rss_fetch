      <title>Uniform Convergence of Adversarially Robust Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there has been significant interest in the effect of different types of adversarial perturbations in data classification problems. Many of these models incorporate the adversarial power, which is an important parameter with an associated trade-off between accuracy and robustness. This work considers a general framework for adversarially-perturbed classification problems, in a large data or population-level limit. In such a regime, we demonstrate that as adversarial strength goes to zero that optimal classifiers converge to the Bayes classifier in the Hausdorff distance. This significantly strengthens previous results, which generally focus on $L^1$-type convergence. The main argument relies upon direct geometric comparisons and is inspired by techniques from geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>A convergence result for the derivation of front propagation in nonlocal phase field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the mean curvature of a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$, arises as the limit of a sequence of functions that are intrinsically related to the difference between an $n$- and $1$-dimensional fractional Laplacian of a phase transition. Depending on the order of the fractional Laplace operator, we recover the fractional mean curvature or the classical mean curvature of the surface. Moreover, we show that this is an essential ingredient for deriving the evolution of fronts in fractional reaction-diffusion equations such as those for atomic dislocations in crystals.</description>

      <title>The discrete dislocation dynamics of multiple dislocation loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation that physically arises from the classical Peierls-Nabarro model for dislocations in crystalline structures. Our initial configuration corresponds to multiple slip loop dislocations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$. After suitably rescaling the equation with a small phase parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the rescaled solution solves a fractional Allen-Cahn equation. We show that, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the limiting solution exhibits multiple interfaces evolving independently and according to their mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Compactness via monotonicity in nonsmooth critical point theory, with application to Born-Infeld type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove new existence and multiplicity results for critical points of lower semicontinuous functionals in Banach spaces, complementing the nonsmooth critical point theory set forth by Szulkin. In particular, we get general deformation lemmas avoiding the Palais-Smale condition, and we adapt a monotonicity trick suited to our problems. We apply our results to study entire solutions with finite energy to Born-Infeld type autonomous equations with continuous nonlinearity $f$. Under nearly optimal conditions on $f$, we construct solutions including for the first time, nonradial ones. A companion nonexistence theorem shows the sharpness of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the set of non radiative solutions for the energy critical wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non radiative solutions of the energy critical non linear wave equation are global solutions $u$ that furthermore have vanishing asymptotic energy outside the lightcone at both $t \to \pm \infty$: \[ \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \| \nabla_{t,x} u(t) \|_{L^2(|x| \ge |t|+R)} = 0, \] for some $R \gt 0$. They were shown to play an important role in the analysis of long time dynamics of solutions, in particular regarding the soliton resolution: we refer to the seminal works of Duyckaerts, Kenig and Merle, see \cite{DKM:23} and the references therein. We show that the set of non radiative solutions which are small in the energy space is a manifold whose tangent space at $0$ is given by non radiative solutions to the linear equation (described in \cite{CL24}). We also construct nonlinear solutions with an arbitrary prescribed radiation field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Oldroyd-type constitutive law. By establishing uniform a priori estimates (with respect to re-laxation time), we show global existence of smooth solutions with small initial data. Moreover,we get global-in-time convergence of the system towards the classical isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>On the planar Taylor-Couette system and related exterior problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the planar Taylor-Couette system for the steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid in the region between two concentric disks, the inner one being at rest and the outer one rotating with constant angular speed. We study the uniqueness and multiplicity of solutions to the forced system in different classes. For any angular velocity we prove that the classical Taylor-Couette flow is the unique smooth solution displaying rotational symmetry. Instead, we show that infinitely many solutions arise, even for arbitrarily small angular velocities, in a larger, class of \textit{incomplete} solutions that we introduce. By prescribing the transversal flux, unique solvability of the Taylor-Couette system is recovered among rotationally invariant incomplete solutions. Finally, we study the behavior of these solutions as the radius of the outer disk goes to infinity, connecting our results with the celebrated Stokes paradox.</description>

      <title>Prescribed nonlinearity helps in an anisotropic Calder\'on-type problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I consider the inverse boundary value problem for a quasilinear, anisotropic, elliptic equation of the form $\nabla\cdot(\gamma\nabla u+|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)=0$, where $\gamma$ is a smooth, matrix valued, function with a uniform lower bound. I show that boundary Dirichlet and Neumann data for this equation, in the form of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, determine the coefficient matrix uniquely, in dimension 3 and higher. This stands in contrast to the classical linear anisotropic Calder\'on problem where there is a known obstruction to uniqueness due to the invariance of the boundary data under transformations of the equation via any boundary fixing diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Stability of positive radial steady states for the parabolic H\'enon-Lane-Emden system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When it comes to the nonlinear heat equation $u_t - \Delta u = u^p$, the stability of positive radial steady states in the supercritical case was established in the classical paper by Gui, Ni and Wang. We extend this result to systems of reaction-diffusion equations by studying the positive radial steady states of the parabolic H\'enon-Lane-Emden system $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} u_t - \Delta u &amp;= |x|^k v^p &amp;\mbox{ in } \mathbb R^n \times (0,\infty),\\ v_t - \Delta v &amp;= |x|^l u^q &amp;\mbox{ in } \mathbb R^n \times (0,\infty), \end{aligned} \right.$$ where $k,l\geq 0$, $p,q\geq 1$ and $pq&gt;1$. Assume that $(p,q)$ lies either on or above the Joseph-Lundgren critical curve which arose in the work of Chen, Dupaigne and Ghergu. Then all positive radial steady states have the same asymptotic behavior at infinity, and they are all stable solutions of the parabolic H\'enon-Lane-Emden system in $\mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Blow-up and global existence for semilinear parabolic equations on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate existence of global in time solutions and blow-up of solutions to the semilinear heat equation posed on infinite graphs. The source term is a general function $f(u)$. We always assume that the infimum of the spectrum of the Laplace operator $\lambda_1(G)$ on the graph is positive. According to an interaction between the behavior of $f$ close to $0$ and the value $\lambda_1(G)$, we get the existence of a global in time solution or blow-up of any nonnegative solution, provided that the initial datum is nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Quantitative pointwise estimates of the cooling process for inelastic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for hard spheres. We first prove that the solution $f(t,v)$ is pointwisely bounded from above by $C_{f_0}\langle t \rangle^3$ and establish that the cooling time is infinite $T_c = +\infty$ under the condition $f_0 \in L^1_2 \cap L^{\infty}_{s} $ for $s &gt; 2 $. Away from the zero velocity, we further prove that $f(t,v)\leq C_{f_0, \epsilon} \langle t \rangle $ for $|v| \leq \epsilon$ at any time $t &gt; 0 $ and $\epsilon&gt;0$. This time-growing pointwise upper-bound is natural in the cooling process, as we expect the density near $v = 0 $ to grow rapidly. As a consequence, via these results, we obtain Maxwellian upper-bounds of solutions for each time. Our upper-bounds hold for any constant normal restitution $ 0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1 $ and are uniform in $ \alpha$.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions for the inverse mean curvature flow in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in the Heisenberg group $(\He^n, d_\varepsilon)$, where $d_\varepsilon$ is distance associated to either $| \cdot |_\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the natural family of left-invariant Riemannian metrics, or with their sub-Riemannian counterparts for $\varepsilon=0$. For $\Omega \subseteq \He^n$ an open set with smooth boundary $\Sigma_0=\partial \Omega$ satisfying a uniform exterior gauge-ball condition and bounded complement we show existence of a global weak IMCF of generalized hypersurfaces $\{\Sigma^\varepsilon_s\}_{s \geq 0} \subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$ which is proper. Here, both in the Riemannian and in the sub-Riemannian setting, we adopt the weak formulation introduced by Huisken and Ilmanen in \cite{HuiskenIlmanen}, following the approach in \cite{Moser} due to Moser and based on the the link between IMCF and $p$-harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relativistic, spatially inhomogeneous Fokker-Planck equation with an external confining potential. We prove the exponential time decay of solutions towards the global equilibrium in weighted $L^2$ and Sobolov spaces. Our result holds for a wide class of external potentials and the estimates on the rate of convergence are explicit and constructive. Moreover, we prove that the associated semigroup of the equation has hypoelliptic regularizing properties and we obtain explicit rates on this regularization. The technique is based on the construction of suitable Lyapunov functionals.</description>

      <title>Remarks on solitary waves in equations with nonlocal cubic terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this overview paper, we show existence of smooth solitary-wave solutions to the nonlinear, dispersive evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u + \partial_x(\Lambda^s u + u\Lambda^r u^2) = 0, \end{equation*} where $\Lambda^s, \Lambda^r$ are Bessel-type Fourier multipliers. The linear operator may be of low fractional order, $s&gt;0$, while the operator on the nonlinear part is assumed to act slightly smoother, $r&lt;s-1$. The problem is related to the mathematical theory of water waves; we build upon previous works on similar equations, extending them to allow for a nonlocal nonlinearity. Mathematical tools include constrained minimization, Lion's concentration-compactness principle, spectral estimates, and product estimates in fractional Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear Robin problems for harmonic and polyharmonic functions in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence and global regularity results for boundary-value problems of Robin type for harmonic and polyharmonic functions in $n$-dimensional half-spaces are established. The Robin condition on the normal derivative on the boundary of the half-space is prescribed by a nonlinear function $\mathcal N$ of the relevant harmonic or polyharmonic functions. General Orlicz type growths for the function $\mathcal N$ are considered. For instance, functions $\mathcal N$ of classical power type, their perturbations by logarithmic factors, and exponential functions are allowed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell equations set on a domain made up of two subdomains that represent a magnetic conductor and a non-magnetic material, and we assume that the relative magnetic permeability $\mu_{r}$ between the two materials is high. We prove uniform a priori estimates for Maxwell solutions when the interface between the two subdomains is supposed to be Lipschitz. Assuming smoothness for the interface between the subdomains, we prove also that the magnetic field possesses a multiscale expansion in powers of $1/ \sqrt{\mu_{r}}$ with profiles rapidly decaying inside the magnetic conductor.</description>

      <title>Interacting phase fields yielding phase separation on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article we study diffuse interface models for two-phase biomembranes. We will do so by starting off with a diffuse interface model on $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by two coupled phase fields $u,v$. The first phase field $u$ is the diffuse approximation of the interior of the membrane; the second phase field $v$ is the diffuse approximation of the two phases of the membrane. We prove a compactness result and a lower bound in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence for pairs of phase functions $(u_\varepsilon,v_\varepsilon)$. As an application of this first result, we consider a diffuse approximation of a two-phase Willmore functional plus line tension energy.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of the backward behavior of solutions of the initial boundary value problem for the chevron pattern equations under homogeneous Dirichlet's boundary conditions. We prove that, as $t\rightarrow \infty$, the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the considered problem is completely determined by the dynamics of a finite set of functionals. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence for the blow-up of certain solutions of the backward problem in finite time in 1D.</description>

      <title>Global existence of solutions to a nonlocal equation with degenerate anisotropic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global existence of very weak solutions to a non-local diffusion-advection-reaction equation is established under no-flux boundary conditions in higher dimensions. The equation features degenerate myopic diffusion and nonlocal adhesion and is an extension of a mass-conserving model recently derived in arXiv:2308.05676. The admissible degeneracy of the diffusion tensor is characterised in terms of the upper box fractal dimension.</description>

      <title>Internal modes and radiation damping for quadratic Klein-Gordon in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Klein-Gordon equations with an external potential $V$ and a quadratic nonlinearity in $3+1$ space dimensions. We assume that $V$ is regular and decaying and that the (massive) Schr\"odinger operator $H=-\Delta+V+m^2$ has a positive eigenvalue $\lambda^2&lt;m^2$ with associated eigenfunction $\phi.$ This is a so-called internal mode and gives rise to time-periodic and spatially localized solutions of the linear flow. We address the classical question of whether such solutions persist under the full nonlinear flow, and describe the behavior of all solutions in a suitable neighborhood of zero. Provided a natural Fermi-Golden rule holds, our main result shows that a solution to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation can be decomposed into a discrete component $a(t)\phi$ where $a(t)$ decays over time, and a continuous component $v$ which has some weak dispersive properties. We obtain precise asymptotic information on these components such as the sharp rates of decay $\vert a(t) \vert \approx t^{-1/2}$ and ${\| v(t) \|}_{L^\infty_x} \approx t^{-1}$, (where the implicit constants are independent of the small size of the data) as well as the growth of a natural weighted norm of the profile of $v.$ In particular, our result extends the seminal work of Soffer-Weinstein for the cubic Klein-Gordon, and shows that radiation damping also occurs in the quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Solitary waves for dispersive equations with Coifman-Meyer nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a modified version of Weinstein's argument for constrained minimization in nonlinear dispersive equations, we prove existence of solitary waves in fully nonlocally nonlinear equations, as long as the linear multiplier is of positive and slightly higher order than the Coifman-Meyer nonlinear multiplier. It is therefore the relative order of the linear term over the nonlinear one that determines the method and existence for these types of equations. In analogy to Korteweg-De Vries-type equations and water waves in the capillary regime, smooth solutions of all amplitudes can be found. We consider two structural types of symmetric Coifman-Meyer symbols $n(\xi-\eta,\eta)$, and show that cyclical symmetry is necessary for the existence of a functional formulation. Estimates for the solution and wave speed are given as the solutions tend to the bifurcation point of solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and trend to equilibrium for the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system with a confining potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study well-posedness and long time behavior of the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson- Fokker-Planck system with an external confining potential. The system describes the time evolution of particles (e.g.$\,\,$in a plasma) undergoing diffusion, friction and Coulomb interaction. We prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in a weighted Sobolev space. Moreover, we prove that the solutions converge to the global equilibrium exponentially. Our results hold for a wide class of external potentials and the estimates on the rate of convergence are explicit and constructive. The technique is based on the construction of Lyapunov functionals, new short and long time estimates for the linearized system, and fixed point arguments.</description>

      <title>Singular profile of free boundary of incompressible inviscid fluid with external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to investigate the singular profile of the free boundary of two-dimensional incompressible inviscid fluid with external force near the stagnation point. More precisely, given an external force with some polynomial type decay close to the stagnation point, the singular profile of the free boundary at stagnation point possible are corner wave, flat and cusp singularity. Through excluding the cusp and flat singularity, we know the only singular profile is corner wave singularity, and the corner depends on the decay rate of the solution near the stagnation point. The analysis depends on the geometric method to a class of Bernoulli-type free boundary problem with given degenerate gradient function on free boundary. This work is motivated by the significant work [E. V$\breve{a}$rv$\breve{a}$ruc$\breve{a}$ and G. Weiss, Acta Math, 206, 363-403, (2011)] on Stokes conjecture to the incompressible inviscid fluid acted on by gravity.</description>

Abstract: Local indices at isolated fixed points of a differentiable compact nonlinear map $T$ on Banach spaces will be discussed. These results are applied to establish the existence of nontrivial solutions. As an example, the existence of nontrivial weak solutions to a class of nonlinear strongly coupled elliptic systems of two equations will also be studied. A bifurcation phenomenon due to cross-diffusion is reported.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for a kinetic bacterial chemotaxis model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform stability analysis of a kinetic bacterial chemotaxis model of bacterial self-organization, assuming that bacteria respond sharply to chemical signals. The resulting discontinuous tumbling kernel represents the key challenge for the stability analysis as it rules out a direct linearization of the nonlinear terms. To address this challenge we fruitfully separate the evolution of the shape of the cellular profile from its global motion. We provide a full nonlinear stability theorem in a perturbative setting when chemical degradation can be neglected. With chemical degradation we prove stability of the linearized operator. In both cases we obtain exponential relaxation to equilibrium with an explicit rate using hypocoercivity techniques. To apply a hypocoercivity approach in this setting, we develop two novel and specific approaches: i) the use of the $H^1$ norm instead of the $L^2$ norm, and ii) the treatment of nonlinear terms. This work represents an important step forward in bacterial chemotaxis modeling from a kinetic perspective as most results are currently only available for the macroscopic descriptions, which are usually parabolic in nature. Significant difficulty arises due to the lack of regularization of the kinetic transport operator as compared to the parabolic operator in the macroscopic scaling limit.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence and stochastic homogenization of second order singular perturbation models for phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effective behavior of random, heterogeneous, anisotropic, second order phase transitions energies that arise in the study of pattern formations in physical-chemical systems. Specifically, we study the asymptotic behavior, as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, of random heterogeneous anisotropic functionals in which the second order perturbation competes not only with a double well potential but also with a possibly negative contribution given by the first order term. We prove that, under suitable growth conditions and under a stationarity assumption, the functionals $\Gamma$-converge almost surely to a surface energy whose density is independent of the space variable. Furthermore, we show that the limit surface density can be described via a suitable cell formula and is deterministic when ergodicity is assumed.</description>
