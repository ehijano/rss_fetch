      <title>The local similarity theory, including the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length. Dissipation of energies and structural parameters in the atmospheric CBL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses a variant of the local similarity theory, employing the second moment of vertical velocity and the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length as basic parameters. This approach allows expressing the turbulent exchange coefficient, dissipations of kinetic energy and buoyancy square, mixed moments of the buoyancy and vertical velocity, as well as structural parameters solely through two independent basic parameters of local similarity. Comparison of local similarity approximations with experimental data convincingly confirms the correctness of the proposed relationships and demonstrates the high efficiency of the considered theory. It is established that the approximations of the turbulent exchange coefficient and dissipations of local similarity are fully consistent with the semi-empirical theories of Prandtl, Hanna, Richardson-Onsager and the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectral theory with the law -5/3 for the atmospheric CBL. Thus, the new theory of local similarity significantly extends the scope of applications of well-known turbulence theories and substantially complements our understanding of turbulent convection.</description>

      <title>Online learning in idealized ocean gyres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence parameterization has principally been based on processed-based approaches, seeking to embed physical principles so that coarser resolution calculations can capture the net influence of smaller scale unresolved processes. More recently there has been an increasing focus on the application of data-driven approaches to this problem. Here we consider the application of online learning to data-driven eddy parameterization, constructing an end-to-end differentiable dynamical solver forced by a neural network, and training the neural network based on the dynamics of the combined hybrid system. This approach is applied to the classic barotropic Stommel-Munk gyre problem -- a highly idealized configuration which nevertheless includes multiple flow regimes, boundary dynamics, and a separating jet, and therefore presents a challenging test case for the online learning approach. It is found that a suitable network architecture which is suitably trained can lead to a coarse resolution neural network parameterized model which is stable, and has both a reasonable mean state and intrinsic variability. This suggests that online learning is a powerful tool for studying the problem of ocean turbulence parameterization.</description>

      <title>The potential impact of large-scale wind clusters on the local weather patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To decarbonise the electricity sector and achieve renewable energy targets, a rapidly growing number of wind farms have been authorised, constructed, and commissioned in the UK and EU in recent years. For instance, the UK Government aims to expand offshore wind capacity to 60 GW by 2030, while the EU has set a target of 120 GW of offshore renewable energy by the same year. Given these substantial projected capacities, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the potential impacts of large-scale wind clusters on local weather patterns to prevent unintended consequences prior to deployment. In this paper, we use the WRF model to simulate four scenarios with varying wind energy capacities in the North Sea, assessing the potential effects of these wind clusters on the local weather patterns over mainland UK. Please note that the simulations of Case 3 and Case 4 are still ongoing, while all analyses in the current version of manuscript are all based on Case 1 and Case 2.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from two prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's End-to-End Neural Forecasting System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels have prompted the need for eco-friendly power generation methods based on renewable energy. However, renewable energy sources often face challenges in providing stable power due to low energy density and non-stationary. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model, aiming both high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ). The proposed architecture LSTM-DE, integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust UQ, achieving accuracy and reliability in wave height prediction. To further enhance the reliability of the predictive models, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Based on the real operational data obtained from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, we demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-DE model architecture achieves notable predictive accuracy (R2 &gt; 0.9) while increasing the uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. The findings show that the proposed method provides robust and reliable real-time wave height predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Uncertainty Quantification for Ice Sheet Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice sheet simulations suffer from vast parametric uncertainties, such as the basal sliding boundary condition or geothermal heat flux. Quantifying the resulting uncertainties in predictions is of utmost importance to support judicious decision-making, but high-fidelity simulations are too expensive to embed within uncertainty quantification (UQ) computations. UQ methods typically employ Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistics of interest, which requires hundreds (or more) of ice sheet simulations. Cheaper low-fidelity models are readily available (e.g., approximated physics, coarser meshes), but replacing the high-fidelity model with a lower fidelity surrogate introduces bias, which means that UQ results generated with a low-fidelity model cannot be rigorously trusted. Multifidelity UQ retains the high-fidelity model but expands the estimator to shift computations to low-fidelity models, while still guaranteeing an unbiased estimate. Through this exploitation of multiple models, multifidelity estimators guarantee a target accuracy at reduced computational cost. This paper presents a comprehensive multifidelity UQ framework for ice sheet simulations. We present three multifidelity UQ approaches -- Multifidelity Monte Carlo, Multilevel Monte Carlo, and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator -- that enable tractable UQ for continental-scale ice sheet simulations. We demonstrate the techniques on a model of the Greenland ice sheet to estimate the 2015-2050 ice mass loss, verify their estimates through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, and give a comparative performance analysis. For a target accuracy equivalent to 1 mm sea level rise contribution at 95% confidence, the multifidelity estimators achieve computational speedups of two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum for sea state inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and exploit a recent reformulation, based on an original change of variables, of the double integral that describes the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum measured by High-Frequency radars. We show that this alternative expression, which was primarily designed for improving the numerical inversion of the ocean wave spectrum, is also advantageous for the analytical inversion of the main sea state parameters. To this end, we revisit Barrick's method for the estimation of the significant wave height and the mean period from the ocean Doppler spectrum. On the basis of numerical simulations we show that a better estimation of these parameters can be achieved which necessitates a preliminary bias correction that depends only on the radar frequency. A second consequence of this improved formulation is the derivation of a simple yet analytical nonlinear approximation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum when the Doppler frequency is larger than the Bragg frequency. This opens up new perspectives for the inversion of directional wave spectra from High-Frequency radar measurements.</description>

      <title>Challenges of learning multi-scale dynamics with AI weather models: Implications for stability and one solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term stability and physical consistency are critical properties for AI-based weather models if they are going to be used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts or beyond, e.g., climate change projection. However, current AI-based weather models can only provide short-term forecasts accurately since they become unstable or physically inconsistent when time-integrated beyond a few weeks or a few months. Either they exhibit numerical blow-up or hallucinate unrealistic dynamics of the atmospheric variables, akin to the current class of autoregressive large language models. The cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory. In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein, \textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based time-integrators amplify this bias, leading to unstable error propagation. Finally, using the quasi-geostrophic flow and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data as test cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and numerical analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such unphysical behavior. We develop long-term physically-consistent data-driven models for the climate system and demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of time-integration with accurate mean and variability.</description>

      <title>Global transformer overheating from geomagnetic storms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertia-gravity waves are scattered by background flows as a result of Doppler shift by a non-uniform velocity. In the WKB regime, the scattering process reduces to a diffusion in spectral space. Other inhomogeneities the waves encounter, such as density variations, also cause scattering and spectral diffusion. We generalise the spectral diffusion equation to account for these inhomogeneities. We apply the result to the rotating shallow water system, for which height inhomogeneities arise from velocity inhomogeneities through geostrophy, and to the Boussinesq system for which buoyancy inhomogeneities arise similarly. We compare the contributions that height and buoyancy variations make to the spectral diffusion with the contribution of the Doppler shift. In both systems, we find regimes where all contributions are significant. We support our findings with exact solutions of the diffusion equation and with ray tracing simulations in the shallow water case.</description>

      <title>WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</description>
