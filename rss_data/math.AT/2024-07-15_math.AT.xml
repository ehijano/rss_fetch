      <title>Intersections of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study simplicial complexes (hypergraphs closed under taking subsets) that are the intersection of a given number k of matroids. We prove bounds on their chromatic numbers (the minimum number of edges required to cover the ground set) and their list chromatic numbers. Settling a conjecture of Kiraly and Berczi et. al., we prove that the list chromatic number is at most k times the chromatic number. Following the footsteps of Edmonds, who considered the case k=2, we study three polytopes associated with k-tuples of matroids, and prove bounds on the distances between them. The tools used are in part topological.</description>

      <title>Directed univalence in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory with a directed path type which internalizes the notion of a homomorphism within a type. This concept has significant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for synthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it leads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work, we construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial homomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new reasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct the universe of discrete types $\mathcal{S}$. We prove that homomorphisms in this type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that $\mathcal{S}$ is directed univalent. The construction of $\mathcal{S}$ is foundational for both of the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to define several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results from category theory. Using $\mathcal{S}$, we are also able to define various types whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first complete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.</description>

      <title>Coloring the intersection of two matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result \cite{matcomp} from 2006 of Aharoni and the first author of this paper states that for any two natural numbers p, q, where p divides q, if a matroid M is p-colorable and a matroid N is q-colorable then M \cap N is (p+q)-colorable. In this paper we show that the assumption that p divides q is in fact redundant, and we also prove that M \cap N is even p+q list-colorable.
  The result uses topology and relies on a new parameter yielding a lower bound for the topological connectivity of the intersection of two matroids.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for determining whether a character belongs to $\Sigma^m$. In order to apply it we just need to know that the ambient group is of type $\mathrm{FP}_m$ or of type $\mathrm{F}_2$ and that the word problem is solvable for this group. Then finite data is sufficient proof of membership in $\Sigma^m$, not just for the given character but also for a neighborhood of it.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes in persistence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of persistent homology in applications is justified by the validity of certain stability results. At the core of such results is a notion of distance between the invariants that one associates with data sets. Here we introduce a general framework to compare distances and invariants in multiparameter persistence, where there is no natural choice of invariants and distances between them. We define amplitudes, monotone, and subadditive invariants that arise from assigning a non-negative real number to objects of an abelian category. We then present different ways to associate distances to such invariants, and we provide a classification of classes of amplitudes relevant to topological data analysis. In addition, we study the the relationships as well as the discriminitative power of such amplitude distances arising in topological data analysis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic sets as a model of homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets are presheaves on a rich category of shapes, whose definition is motivated by combinatorial topology and higher-dimensional diagram rewriting. These shapes include representatives of oriented simplices, cubes, and positive opetopes, and are stable under operations including Gray products, joins, suspensions, and duals. We exhibit a cofibrantly generated model structure on diagrammatic sets, as well as two separate Quillen equivalences with the classical model structure on simplicial sets. We construct explicit sets of generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations, and prove that the model structure is monoidal with the Gray product of diagrammatic sets.</description>

      <title>Biracks: a notational proposal and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a notation for biracks that includes from the begining the knowledege of the associated (or underlying, or derived) rack structure. Motivated by results of Rump in the involutive case, this notation allows to generalize some results from involutive case to the non necessarily involutive solutions, and also to view some twisting constructions and its relation to the underlying rack structure in a more transparent way. Two applications are given.</description>

      <title>The Connectedness Homomorphism between Discrete Morse Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two discrete Morse functions on a simplicial complex, we introduce the {\em connectedness homomorphism} between the corresponding discrete Morse complexes. This concept leads to a novel framework for studying the connectedness in discrete Morse theory at the chain complex level. In particular, we apply it to describe a discrete analogy to `cusp-degeneration' of Morse complexes. A precise comparison between smooth case and our discrete cases is also given.</description>
