      <title>The fate of Gaia's wide binaries: Interplay of white-dwarf recoil and tidal capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) receive natal velocity boosts of $\sim 1 \, \mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ due to recoil from asymmetric mass loss during the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage. In a wide binary, the acceleration of a proto-WD exerts a torque, modifying the orbital eccentricity. Potential signatures of this effect have been detected in Gaia's astrometric binary sample. At the same time, an AGB star's puffy envelope facilitates strong tidal interactions in binaries with periapsis separations of a few AU, capturing the companion into a tighter orbit and potentially driving the system towards a common-envelope phase. Using an analytical model for wide binary evolution under asymmetric AGB mass loss, we find that recoil can induce tidal interactions in up to $30\%$ of initially wide binaries on the AGB or post-AGB for initial separations of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ AU. We relate these interactions to three recent observational puzzles: (i) The dearth of wide WD+MS and WD+WD binaries in Gaia DR3 with eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.9$. (ii) The formation of moderately eccentric WD+MS and WD+WD binaries with orbital periods of $\sim 100 \mbox{--} 1000$ days, which may happen via a high-eccentricity common-envelope phase. (iii) The origin of low-luminosity, long-timescale, dust-obscured transients towards AGB progenitors, such as the ongoing event WNTR23bzdiq in M31. Our findings have potential implications for the survival and dynamical evolution of planetary systems around WD progenitors, to be investigated in future works.</description>

      <title>The Variable Sky Through the OGLE Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) is one of the most productive and influential photometric sky surveys in the history of observational astronomy. Originally designed to detect dark matter through gravitational microlensing events, OGLE has evolved into a cornerstone of time-domain astrophysics, delivering three decades of two-band, high-cadence observations of approximately two billion stars across the Galactic bulge, disk, and Magellanic System. This review summarizes OGLE's key contributions to variable star research, including the discovery, classification and characterization of pulsating stars, eclipsing, ellipsoidal, and rotating variables, or irregular and eruptive stars. Particular emphasis is placed on the OGLE Collection of Variable Stars (OCVS), a publicly available and systematically expanded dataset that has become a fundamental resource for studies of stellar variability and evolution, Milky Way and other galaxies structure, microlensing, compact objects, exoplanets and more. The synergy between OGLE and other major sky surveys, including ASAS, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Gaia, KMTNet, MACHO, MOA, TESS, PLATO, or ZTF further amplifies its scientific reach.</description>

      <title>Exploring the History of Stellar Mergers with Chemistry: Examining the Origins of Massive $\alpha$-Enriched Stars using Carbon Isotope Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered massive $\alpha$-enriched (MAE) stars have surface chemistry consistent with members of the older thick disk Milky Way population but high masses ($\sim$ 1.5 - 3 M$_{\odot}$) that suggest these stars are young. The origin of MAE stars is not fully understood although binary interactions are likely an important formation pathway. To better constrain the history of MAE stars, we have measured metallicities, carbon isotope ratios, and CNO abundances in 49 red clump stars and four red giants. Our sample included thin disk, thick disk, and MAE stars to best constrain different formation scenarios. We observed our sample stars using the Tull spectrograph on the McDonald 2.7m telescope and derived abundances using synthetic spectra created by the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code. Overall, we find that 10 of our red clump MAE stars are consistent with the average thick disk carbon isotope ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 8.2 $\pm$ 3.4. We find five MAE stars that have significantly higher carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $&gt;$ 15) than stars at similar metallicities. Two of the anomalous stars show abundance patterns consistent with AGB mass transfer while three MAE stars have $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios similar to massive, single RC stars and show no clear signs of binarity from radial velocity monitoring or from the Gaia RUWE measurement. Overall, we find that carbon isotope ratio measurements provide a unique constraint when discerning the possible origins of MAE stars.</description>

      <title>Rotational radial shear in the low solar photosphere. Direct detection from high-resolution spectro-imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial differential rotation is an important factor in stellar dynamo theory. In the Sun, helioseismology has revealed a near surface shear layer in the upper 5 to 10% of the convection zone. At low to midlatitudes, the rotation velocity gradient decreases sharply near the surface. A depth gradient in rotational velocity was recently detected in the low photosphere using a differential interferometric method on spectroscopic data. Granular structures at different depths in the FeI 630.15 nm line showed a systematic retrograde shift compared to continuum structures, suggesting a height-related decrease in angular velocity, dependent on the assumed granulation coherence time. We use a more direct approach to measure the differential rotational velocity at different photospheric heights. We performed spectroscopic scans of the same granular region in FeI 630.15 nm and CaI 616.2 nm lines and measured displacements of images at different line chords between consecutive scans. These observations require excellent seeing, stable adaptive optics, and scanning times shorter than the granulation lifetime. Adaptive optics stabilizes continuum images but not higher-altitude rotation differences. We used THEMIS and HINODE SOT FeI data to measure formation height differences via perspective shifts observed away from the disk center with the slit radially oriented. Measurements at disk center and $\pm$25{\deg} latitude along the central meridian show a parabolic decrease in rotational velocity with height, reaching about 16% slower rotation at 80 km above the continuum. No significant difference is found between the equator and $\pm$25{\deg} latitudes. The low photosphere is a transition zone between the convective and radiative layers. Our measurements provide new constraints on its dynamical behavior and valuable boundary conditions for numerical simulations of the Sun s upper convection zone.</description>

      <title>Detection of Millimeter-Wavelength Flares from Two Accreting White Dwarf Systems in the SPT-3G Galactic Plane Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind discoveries of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) transient events in non-targeted surveys, as opposed to follow-up or pointed observations, have only become possible in the past decade using cosmic microwave background surveys. Here we present the first results from the SPT-3G Galactic Plane Survey -- the first dedicated high-sensitivity, wide-field, time-domain, mm-wave survey of the Galactic Plane, conducted with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) using the SPT-3G camera. The survey field covers approximately 100 $\text{deg}^2$ near the Galactic center. In 2023 and 2024, this survey consists of roughly 1,500 individual 20-minute observations in three bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz, with plans for more observations in the coming years. We report the detection of two transient events exceeding a 5$\sigma$ threshold in both the 95 and 150 GHz bands in the first two years of SPT-3G Galactic Plane Survey data. Both events are unpolarized and exhibit durations of approximately one day, with peak flux densities at 150 GHz of at least 50 mJy. The peak isotropic luminosities at 150 GHz are on the order of $10^{31}~\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1}$. Both events are associated with previously identified accreting white dwarfs. Magnetic reconnection in the accretion disk is a likely explanation for the observed millimeter flares. In the future, we plan to expand the transient search in the Galactic Plane by lowering the detection threshold, enabling single-band detections, analyzing lightcurves on a range of timescales, and including additional data from future observations.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Survey of Archival UV and X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess archival high-energy data for key stars on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Target Stars and Systems 2025 list, as stellar radiation is critical to shaping and interpreting planetary atmospheres. Using a sample of 98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE, Swift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage, assess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available, with most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have far-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have high-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or broad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV spectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution modeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV bands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting assessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric photochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or contemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our findings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated multiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve stellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face potential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure these critical data. Investing in this effort now will directly support the science goals of HWO and enhance future studies of planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the dominant waves in the extended solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended solar corona at 10-30 solar radii is essentially devoid of all waves below 100 kHz other than triggered ion acoustic waves (TIAW), which consist of a low frequency electromagnetic wave at a frequency of a few Hz coupled to one or more electrostatic waves at a few hundred Hz, such that the amplitudes of the higher frequency waves peak at a fixed phase of each low frequency wave period. All the waves in a TIAW event travel at the same phase speed, which is found to be 150 km s (the ion acoustic speed was about 100 km s). It has not been possible to explain the TIAW as a resonant wave-wave interaction, so a non-resonant interaction has been considered in which the loss of energy by the low frequency wave is used to both heat the electrons and grow the higher frequency waves. Evidence in support of this explanation is described and a PIC simulation that discusses this process is summarized. This interplay between a pair of waves, mediated by modifications of plasma parameters and energy conversion, represents a significant nonlinear process in plasma physics, the study of which will deepen the understanding of energy transfer, wave generation, and plasma dynamics in diverse astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Lyman-Alpha Emission from K and M Dwarfs: Intrinsic Profiles, Variability, and Flux in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is the most prominent ultraviolet emission line in low-mass stars, playing a crucial role in exoplanet atmospheric photochemistry, heating, and escape. However, interstellar medium (ISM) absorption typically obscures most of the Ly$\alpha$ profile, requiring reconstructions that introduce systematic uncertainties. We present intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles for 12 high radial velocity K and M dwarfs, where Doppler shifting minimizes ISM contamination, allowing direct measurements of $\sim$50-95\% of the line flux. Our sample spans the K-to-M spectral transition, enabling us to constrain the dependence of self-reversals in Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles on effective temperature ($T_{eff}$). The depth of self-reversal, driven by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) effects, decreases with decreasing $T_{eff}$, with M dwarfs exhibiting little to none. Two stars, Ross 1044 and Ross 451, were observed over multiple days, revealing $\sim$20\% Ly$\alpha$ variability confined to the line core - implying that studies relying on reconstructions may underestimate temporal variability. We find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ flux, peak-to-trough ratio, and hydrogen departure coefficients with $T_{eff}$, providing empirical constraints for stellar atmosphere models. A comparison of Ly$\alpha$ flux in the habitable zone shows measured values for high radial velocity stars less than the reconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages of the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model deficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal). Our results establish an empirical foundation for Ly$\alpha$ emission in K and M dwarfs, reducing uncertainties in reconstructions and improving models of stellar UV emission relevant to exoplanetary studies.</description>

      <title>High-resolution simulations of disc tearing in the GW Orionis triple system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disc around the pre-main-sequence triple star system GW Orionis is known from observations to be warped and broken. Theoretical modelling has produced conflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc. Analytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc is only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution simulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick, low-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question. Using the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed by observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by stellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc retains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that any small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the disc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative to the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc better matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure models of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of warps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and often massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might deviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active star-forming neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotation on the accretion of entropy perturbations in collapsing massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection in the innermost shells of massive stars plays an important role in initiating core-collapse supernovae. When these convective motions reach the supernova shock, they create extra turbulence, which helps energize the explosion. In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.</description>

      <title>Good things come to those who wait: Watching donor stars evolve towards a mass-transfer instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable mass transfer in binary systems can lead to transients such as luminous red novae (LRNe). Observations of such transients are valuable for understanding and testing models of mass transfer. For donor stars in the Hertzsprung gap, there can be a long phase of mass-transfer evolution before instability sets in. Only few case studies of such delayed dynamical instability (DDI) mass transfer exist. None consider the full pre-instability evolution and the effects thereof on the observable properties of a binary. We systematically analyse detailed models of stable and unstable mass transfer for Hertzsprung-gap donors. We focus on identifying observable evolutionary features characteristic of ultimately unstable mass transfer and not found in stable mass-transfer binaries. Our binary evolution models, calculated with the MESA code, cover initial donor masses between $2.5 M_{\odot}$ and $10 M_{\odot}$ and initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios between $0.1$ and $1$. We find that the pre-instability evolution is qualitatively the same for all DDI donor stars, consisting of a long slow dimming phase followed by a shorter phase of rapid brightening. The latter phase is powered by recombination of hydrogen and accompanied by a strong increase in effective temperature, unique to unstable mass-transfer binaries. We estimate that a significant fraction of the rapid brighteners should be detectable by Gaia throughout the Galaxy. We model the progenitors of LRNe M31-2015 and V838 Mon, find a higher initial donor mass for M31 2015 than past estimates, and propose a new scenario for V838 Mon in which the known tertiary star dominates the pre-outburst photometry and the outburst results from the DDI of a more massive primary star. This work provides a comprehensive framework linking theory to observations of transients and enables improved classification and prediction of mass-transfer events.</description>

      <title>Large-scale variability in macroturbulence driven by pulsations in the rapidly rotating massive star Zeta Oph from high-cadence ESPRESSO spectroscopy and TESS photometry</title>

Abstract: Despite their importance, the dynamical properties of massive stars remain poorly understood. Rotation is a key driver of internal mixing and angular momentum transport, significantly influencing massive star evolution. However, constraining rotation from spectroscopy is challenging, as spectral lines often exhibit excess broadening beyond rotation. The origin of this additional broadening, typically attributed to large-scale velocity fields and commonly referred to as macroturbulence, remains uncertain and unconstrained. Here, we present the combined analysis of TESS photometry and rapid time-series spectroscopy using the high-resolution ESPRESSO instrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory for the rapidly rotating and pulsating massive star Zeta Ophiuchi. Leveraging excellent temporal coverage, our analysis demonstrates that pulsation-induced variability leads to peak-to-peak scatter as large as 88 km/s in the observed macroturbulent velocity time series. We also demonstrate that time-averaged macroturbulent velocities are spectral line specific and can exceed 100 km/s . Furthermore, the macroturbulent velocities from shorter integration times are systematically lower than those derived from stacked spectra mimicking longer exposure times typically needed for fainter stars. These results highlight the role of pulsations in driving variable macroturbulence in massive stars, while also pointing to a potential bias in spectroscopic estimates of macroturbulence for fainter massive stars.</description>

      <title>Old Galactic novae in the eROSITA All Sky Survey</title>

Abstract: Nova explosions occur on accreting white dwarfs. A thermonuclear runaway in the H-rich accreted envelope causes its ejection without destroying the white dwarf, and an increase in the luminosity by several magnitudes. Accretion is re-established some time after the explosion. The explosion of the nova itself is expected to affect the mass-transfer rate from the secondary and the accretion rate, but these effects have been little explored observationally. Most novae are observed only in outburst and the properties of the host systems are unknown. X-ray observations of novae happen mostly during outburst; only a few have been the target of dedicated X-ray observations years or decades after outburst. However, the X-ray emission long after the outburst provides a powerful diagnostics of the accretion rate and the possible magnetic nature of the white dwarf. We have explored the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All Sky Survey (eRASS) for X-ray sources correlated with Galactic historical novae. We present the first population study of nova hosting systems in X-rays, focus on the evolution of accretion rate as a function of the time since last outburst, and look for new candidates for magnetic systems. In total, 32 X-ray counterparts of novae are found in the western Galactic hemisphere. Combined with 53 nova detections published for the eastern hemisphere, the fraction of X-ray detected novae in quiescence is 18% of the Galactic novae. We have, for the first time, enough statistics to observationally determine the evolution of accretion rate as a function of time since the last nova outburst for a time span of 120 years. The results confirm that magnetic systems remain systematically at higher fluxes and that accretion is enhanced during the first years after the outburst, as predicted theoretically. We also identify new IP candidates in AT Cnc and RR Cha.</description>

      <title>MESAlab: a Pipeline for Mapping the Blue Loop with MESA runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; (Paxton2011, 2013, 2015, 2018, 2019, Jermyn 2023) is a widely used open-source software for modelling stellar evolution. In many studies, the computational grids covers thousands of models (e.g., Joyce et al 2024), which requires a tremendous amount of time and computational effort to process.
  To streamline data analysis, the mesalab package was developed. This Python-based pipeline is designed to simplify the post-processing of MESA outputs by automatically identifying various stellar evolutionary phases, with a specific focus on the ``blue loop'' -- a blue-ward excursion in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) for intermediate-mass stars often associated with peculiar pulsational phenomena like ``strange modes.''</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emission mechanism powering long period radio transients from interacting white dwarf binaries via kinetic plasma simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of long period radio transients, such as GLEAM-X J0704-37 and ILTJ1101 + 5521, have revealed a previously unrecognized population of galactic radio transient sources associated with white dwarf - M dwarf binaries. It is an open question how to produce coherent radio emission in these systems, though a model driven by binary interaction seems likely given the nature and correlation of the emission with the binaries' orbital period. Using kinetic plasma simulations, we demonstrate that the relativistic electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) is a viable mechanism for generating radio pulses in white dwarf - M dwarf systems, akin to planetary radio emission, such as that from the Jupiter-Io system. We quantify the relativistic ECMI in the nonlinear regime under conditions relevant for white dwarf radio emission for the first time. Our simulations demonstrate that the ECMI can intrinsically produce partially linearly polarized emission relevant to explaining the observed emission spectrum of the two galactic sources, though the precise details will depend on the plasma composition. Our work paves the way for a systematic and fully nonlinear computational modeling of radio emission from interacting white dwarf sources.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarf -- M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-polar Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) -- M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD -- MD binaries in the pre-polar phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-polar phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD--MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD--MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{-(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.</description>

      <title>YSES 2b is a background star: Differential astrometric M-dwarf measurements in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We wish to confirm the nature of YSES 2b, a purportedly faint companion of the young star YSES 2. We used on-sky observations from SPHERE and GRAVITY to measure the astrometric position of 2b with respect to the star YSES 2, and examined the competing hypotheses of (i) a bound substellar companion versus (ii) a distant unrelated background source with a non-zero proper motion. YSES 2b appears to be a late-type M-dwarf star over 2 kiloparsecs behind the star YSES 2. It has a transverse velocity of about 300 km/s and is located within one of the spiral arms of the Galaxy. The main discriminant was multiple epochs of GRAVITY astrometry that identified the sub-milliarcsecond parallactic motion of the star.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength observations of a new black-widow millisecond pulsar PSR J1544-2555</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new black-widow millisecond pulsar, PSR J1544-2555, associated with the Fermi-LAT source 4FGL J1544.2-2554. Optical, radio, and gamma-ray observations confirmed its nature as a compact spider binary system. Optical photometry from ULTRACAM revealed a \(\sim\)2.7-hour orbital period, guiding MeerKAT observations that detected \(\sim\)2.4-ms radio pulsations. Subsequent timing campaigns using the Murriyang Parkes Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope allowed us to obtain a preliminary timing solution, which enabled us to find gamma-ray pulsations. The final timing solution, spanning 16 years of Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data, also displays orbital period variations typical of spider pulsars. X-ray observations from eROSITA indicate non-thermal emission, but the relatively low count rate prohibits the search for X-ray pulsations. Optical light curve modelling using Icarus suggests the asymmetry is best explained by a spot model, where uneven heating creates localised temperature variations on the companion. While the optical spectra we obtained are compatible with the physical properties we infer for the companion star, they were not of sufficient signal-to-noise to allow for radial velocity measurements, thus limiting constraints on the neutron star's mass. The observed bluer colour near the light curve minimum suggests possible non-thermal emission from intra-binary shocks, supported by the presence of an X-ray source. This discovery exemplifies the proven capability of the Fermi-LAT catalogue in identifying millisecond pulsar candidates and highlights the role of optical surveys in detecting variable sources suitable for radio follow-up.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Deeply Embedded Protocluster Candidate in NGC 602 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.</description>

      <title>Probing the Turbulent Corona and Heliosphere Using Radio Spectral Imaging Observation during the Solar Conjunction of Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring plasma parameters in the upper solar corona and inner heliosphere is challenging because of the region's weakly emissive nature and inaccessibility for most in situ observations. Radio imaging of broadened and distorted background astronomical radio sources during solar conjunction can provide unique constraints for the coronal material along the line of sight. In this study, we present radio spectral imaging observations of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) from June 9 to June 22, 2024 when it was near the Sun with a projected heliocentric distance of 5 to 27 solar radii, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) at multiple frequencies in the 30--80 MHz range. The imaging data reveal frequency-dependent broadening and distortion effects caused by anisotropic wave propagation through the turbulent solar corona at different distances. We analyze the brightness, size, and anisotropy of the broadened images. Our results provide detailed observations showing that the eccentricity of the unresolved source increases as the line of sight approaches the Sun, suggesting a higher anisotropic ratio of the plasma turbulence closer to the Sun. In addition, the major axis of the elongated source is consistently oriented in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting that the turbulence-induced scattering effect is more pronounced in the direction transverse to the coronal magnetic field. Lastly, when the source undergoes large-scale refraction as the line of sight passes through a streamer, the apparent source exhibits substructures at lower frequencies. This study demonstrates that observations of celestial radio sources with lines of sight near the Sun provide a promising method for measuring turbulence parameters in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12-20~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}~ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($\gtrsim10^{-15}~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$ at distances $\lesssim10^{15}~\mathrm{cm}$) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of Ellerman bombs in the H$\alpha$ line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ellerman bombs (EBs) are small and short-lived magnetic reconnection events in the lower solar atmosphere, most commonly reported in the line wings of the H$\alpha$ line. These events are thought to play a role in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, but their size, short lifetime, and similarity to other brightenings make them difficult to detect. We aim to automatically detect and statistically analyze EBs at different heliocentric angles to find trends in their physical properties. We developed an automated EB detection pipeline based on a star-finding algorithm. This pipeline was used on ten high-resolution H$\alpha$ datasets from the 1-meter Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). This pipeline identifies and tracks EBs in time, while separating them from visually similar pseudo-EBs. It returns key parameters such as size, contrast, lifetime, and occurrence rates based on a dynamic threshold and the more classical static `contrast threshold` of 1.5 times the mean quiet-Sun (QS) intensity. For our dynamic threshold, we found a total of 2257 EBs from 28,772 individual detections across our datasets. On average, the full detection set exhibits an area of 0.44 arcsec$^2$ (0.37 Mm$^2$), a peak intensity contrast of 1.4 relative to the QS, and a median lifetime of 2.3 min. ...</description>

      <title>GeV Gamma-Rays from Molecular Clouds Illuminated by Particles Diffusing from the Adjacent Supernova Remnant G335.2+0.1 Confined in an Expanding Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24{\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.</description>

Abstract: While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin &amp; Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.</description>

      <title>Turbulence inference from CO spectral observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04818</link>

Abstract: Turbulence influences the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds, and plays a key role in regulating star formation. We therefore need methods to accurately infer turbulence properties of molecular clouds from position-position-velocity (PPV) spectral observations. A previous method calibrated with simulation data exists to recover the 3D turbulent velocity dispersion from PPV data. However, that method relies on optically-thin conditions, ignoring any radiative transfer (RT) and chemical effects. In the present study we determine how opacity, RT, and chemical effects influence turbulence measurements with CO lines. We post-process a chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing cloud with a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium line RT code to generate PPV spectral cubes of the CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) lines, and obtain moment maps. We isolate the turbulence in the first-moment maps by using a Gaussian smoothing approach. We compare the CO results with the optically-thin scenario to explore how line excitation and RT impact the turbulence measurements. We find that the turbulent velocity dispersion (sigma_v) measured via CO requires a correction by a factor R_CO, with R_CO,1-0 = 0.88 (+0.09, -0.08) for the CO (1-0) line and R_CO,2-1 = 0.88 (+0.10, -0.08) for the CO (2-1) line. As a consequence, previous measurements of sigma_v were overestimated by about 10-15% on average, with potential overestimates as high as 40%, taking the 1-sigma uncertainty into account.</description>
