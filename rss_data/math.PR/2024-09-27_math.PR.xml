      <title>Invariant measures, periodic measures and pullback measure attractors of McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long term dynamics of the non-autonomous McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations on R^n. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of pullback measure attractors of the non-autonomous dynamical system generated by the solution operators defined in the space of probability measures. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures and periodic measures of the equation under further conditions. We finally establish the upper semi-continuity of pullback measure attractors as well as the convergence of invariant measures and periodic measures when the distribution dependent stochastic equations converge to a distribution independent system.</description>

      <title>Inviscid Limit of the Stochastic Hyperviscous Navier-Stokes Equations and Invariant Measures for the Euler Equations in $\mathbb R^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and some moment estimates for an invariant measure $\mu$ for the two-dimensional ($2$D) deterministic Euler equations on the unbounded domain $\mathbb R^2$ and with highly regular initial data. The result is achieved by first showing the existence of Markov stationary processes which solve the hyperviscous $2$D Navier-Stokes equations with kinematic viscosity $\nu&gt;0$ and an additive stochastic noise scaling as $\sqrt \nu$. We then study the inviscid limit and prove that, as $\nu$ tends to $0$, these processes converge, in an appropriate trajectory space, to a pathwise stationary solution to the Euler equations. Its law is the sought invariant measure $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Minimisers for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Degenerate Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise-induced transitions between multistable states happen in a multitude of systems, such as species extinction in biology, protein folding, or tipping points in climate science. Large deviation theory is the rigorous language to describe such transitions for non-equilibrium systems in the small noise limit. At its core, it requires the computation of the most likely transition pathway, solution to a PDE constrained optimization problem. Standard methods struggle to compute the minimiser in the particular coexistence of (1) multistability, i.e. coexistence of multiple long-lived states, and (2) degenerate noise, i.e. stochastic forcing acting only on a small subset of the system's degrees of freedom. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt existing methods to compute the large deviation minimiser in this setting by combining ideas from optimal control, large deviation theory, and numerical optimisation. We show the efficiency of the introduced method in various applications in biology, medicine, and fluid dynamics, including the transition to turbulence in subcritical pipe flow.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotics of disconnection time of large cylinders by simple and biased random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic disconnection time of a large discrete cylinder $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{d}\times \mathbb{Z}$, $d\geq 2$, by simple and biased random walks. For simple random walk, we derive a sharp asymptotic lower bound that matches the upper bound from [Sznitman, Ann. Probab., 2009]. For biased walks, we obtain bounds that asymptotically match in the principal order when the bias is not too strong, which greatly improves non-matching bounds from [Windisch, Ann. Appl. Probab., 2008]. As a crucial tool in the proof, we also obtain a "very strong" coupling between the trace of random walk on the cylinder and random interlacements, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A remarkable example on clustering of extremes for regularly-varying stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigations on the stable-regenerative double-stable model. This is a stationary regularly varying stochastic process, and here we focus on the case where the memory parameter $\beta\in(0,1/2)$, the tail parameter $\alpha\in(0,1)$, and also the process is non-negative. At the microscopic level, the local behavior of extremes of this process has been fully understood, as the convergence to the tail process has been established recently. At the macroscopic level, our first result enhances the recent extremal limit theorem on the running maxima of the model to a convergence of point processes for the clusters of extremes. Most interestingly, our second result reveals that the model exhibits a phase transition at the mesoscopic level in the following sense: if the block size $d_n$ satisfies $d_n\to\infty, d_n = o(n)$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty} d_n/\log n = \rho\in[0,1]$, then \[ \mathbb P\left(\frac1{b_n}\max_{k=1,\dots,d_n}X_j&gt;y\right) \sim \vartheta_\rho d_n\mathbb P\left(\frac {X_1}{b_n}&gt;y\right) \quad\mbox{ with } \quad \vartheta_\rho = (1-2\rho\beta)\mathfrak q_{F,2}, \] where $b_n$ is such that $\mathbb P(X_1&gt;b_n)\sim n^{-1}$, and $\mathfrak q_{F,2}$ an explicit constant. The phase transition refers to the fact that the constant $\vartheta_\rho$ now depends on the rate $d_n\uparrow \infty$, a feature that is prohibited by the anticlustering condition that is satisfied by most examples of regularly varying stochastic processes in the literature. In particular, the model has recently been shown to have a distinct candidate extremal index and extremal index, two key parameters in the studies of extremes for regularly varying processes. Here, the constant $\vartheta_\rho$ interpolates between the candidate extremal index (with value $\vartheta_0$) and the extremal index (with value $\vartheta_1$). We are unaware of any other examples with such a feature.</description>

      <title>Conformally invariant boundary arcs in double dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two different versions of the double dimer model on a planar domain, where we either fold a single dimer cover on a symmetric domain onto itself across the line of symmetry, or we superimpose two independent dimer covers on two, almost identical, domains that differ only on a certain portion of the boundary. This results in a collection of loops and doubled edges that, unlike in the classical double dimer case of Kenyon, are accompanied by arcs emanating from the line of symmetry or the chosen portion of the boundary. We argue that these arcs together with the associated height function satisfy a discrete version of the coupling of Qian and Werner between the Arc loop ensemble (ALE) and two different variants of the Gaussian free field (with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions). We also show that certain statistics of the arcs (when the loops are disregarded from the picture) converge to conformally invariant quantities in the small-mesh scaling limit, and moreover the limits are the same for the two versions of the model, and equal to the corresponding statistics of the arc loop ensemble (ALE). This gives evidence to the conjecture of [7] (that concerns one of these models).</description>

      <title>A random measure approach to reinforcement learning in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a random measure approach for modeling exploration, i.e., the execution of measure-valued controls, in continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) with controlled diffusion and jumps. First, we consider the case when sampling the randomized control in continuous time takes place on a discrete-time grid and reformulate the resulting stochastic differential equation (SDE) as an equation driven by suitable random measures. The construction of these random measures makes use of the Brownian motion and the Poisson random measure (which are the sources of noise in the original model dynamics) as well as the additional random variables, which are sampled on the grid for the control execution. Then, we prove a limit theorem for these random measures as the mesh-size of the sampling grid goes to zero, which leads to the grid-sampling limit SDE that is jointly driven by white noise random measures and a Poisson random measure. We also argue that the grid-sampling limit SDE can substitute the exploratory SDE and the sample SDE of the recent continuous-time RL literature, i.e., it can be applied for the theoretical analysis of exploratory control problems and for the derivation of learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>Garbage disposal game on finite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The garbage disposal game involves a finite set of individuals, each of whom updates their garbage by either receiving from or dumping onto others. We examine the case where only social neighbors, whose garbage levels differ by a given threshold, can offload an equal proportion of their garbage onto others. Remarkably, in the absence of this threshold, the garbage amounts of all individuals converge to the initial average on any connected social graph that is not a star.</description>

      <title>The hitting time of nice factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $r \ge 3 $, let $n$ be divisible by $r$ and consider the random graph process on $n$ vertices. It was shown recently that in the random graph process, as soon as every vertex is covered by a copy of the complete graph $K_r$, a $K_r$-factor exists with high probability (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024). We prove an analogous hitting time result for all so-called \textit{nice} (hyper-)graphs in the random (hyper-)graph process. The latter is the class of hypergraphs for which the coupling of Oliver Riordan (RSA, Vol. 61 IV, Dec. 2022) is available, and it includes all $u$-uniform strictly $1$-balanced and $3$-connected hypergraphs for $u\ge 3$. Based on Riordan's coupling, our proof leverages a series of further couplings that connect the random $r$-uniform hypergraph process to the random (hyper-)graph process of interest, and then harnesses Jeff Kahn's hitting time result for the hypergraph process (Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 375, July 2021). The main result showcases that the proof concept of (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024) is a general-purpose tool that can translate sharp threshold results from Riordan's coupling to hitting time results.</description>

      <title>Uniform log-Sobolev inequalities for mean field particles beyond flat-convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the nice recent work [48], S. Wang established uniform log-Sobolev inequalities for mean field particles when the energy is flat convex. In this note we comment how to extend his proof to some semi-convex energies provided the curvature lower-bound is not too negative. It is not clear that this could be obtained simply by applying a posteriori a perturbation argument to Wang's result. Rather, we follow his proof and, at steps where the convexity is used, we notice that the uniform conditional or local functional inequalities assumed give some room to allow for a bit of concavity. In particular, this allows to recover other previous results on non-convex systems at high temperature or weak coupling, and to consider situations which mix flat-convexity and weak coupling.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free expectation operators for robust pricing and stocking with heavy-tailed demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain distribution-free bounds for various fundamental quantities used in probability theory by solving optimization problems that search for extreme distributions among all distributions with the same mean and dispersion. These sharpest possible bounds depend only on the mean and dispersion of the driving random variable. We solve the optimization problems by a novel yet elementary technique that reduces the set of all candidate solutions to two-point distributions. We consider a general dispersion measure, with variance, mean absolute deviation and power moments as special cases. We apply the bounds to robust newsvendor stocking and monopoly pricing, generalizing foundational mean-variance works. This shows how pricing and order decisions respond to increased demand uncertainty, including scenarios where dispersion information allows for heavy-tailed demand distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate how quantum expanders (i.e. quantum channels with few Kraus operators but a large spectral gap) can be constructed from unitary designs. Concretely, we prove that a random quantum channel whose Kraus operators are independent unitaries sampled from a $2$-design measure is with high probability an optimal expander (in the sense that its spectral gap is as large as possible). More generally, we show that, if these Kraus operators are independent unitaries of the form $U^{\otimes k}$, with $U$ sampled from a $2k$-design measure, then the corresponding random quantum channel is typically an optimal $k$-copy tensor product expander, a concept introduced by Harrow and Hastings (Quant. Inf. Comput. 2009).</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for mean field Schr\"odinger problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the mean field Schr\"odinger problem from a purely probabilistic point of view by exploiting its connection to stochastic control theory for McKean-Vlasov diffusions. Our main result shows that the mean field Schr\"odinger problem arises as the limit of ``standard'' Schr\"odinger problems over interacting particles. Due to the stochastic maximum principle and a suitable penalization procedure, the result follows as a consequence of novel (quantitative) propagation of chaos results for forward-backwards particle systems. The approach described in the paper seems flexible enough to address other questions in the theory. For instance, our stochastic control technique further allows us to solve the mean field Schr\"odinger problem and characterize its solution, the mean field Schr\"odinger bridge, by a forward-backward planning equation.</description>

      <title>SDE driven by cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process with distributional drift and application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\alpha \in (1,2)$, we study the following stochastic differential equation driven by a non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable process in ${\mathbb R}^d$:
  \begin{align*} {\mathord{{\rm d}}} X_t=b(t,X_t){\mathord{{\rm d}}} t+\sigma(t,X_{t-}){\mathord{{\rm d}}} L_t^{(\alpha)},\ \ X_0 =x \in {\mathbb R}^d, \end{align*} where $b$ belongs to $ L^\infty({\mathbb R}_+;{\mathbf B}_{\infty,\infty}^{-\beta}({\mathbb R}^d))$ with some $\beta\in(0,\frac{\alpha-1}{2})$, and $\sigma:{\mathbb R}_+\times {\mathbb R}^d \to {\mathbb R}^d \otimes {\mathbb R}^d$ is a $d \times d $ matrix-valued measurable function. We point out that the noise could be a cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process. We first show the generalized martingale problems and then establish the stability estimates of solutions. As an application, we give the weak convergence rate of the Euler scheme for additive noises with drift coefficient $b=b(x)$.</description>

Abstract: Moderate deviation principle is achieved by the weak convergence approach for a stochastic Schr\"odinger type equation with linear drift term and noise driven by a $Q$-Wiener process. The central limit theorem is also shown for the equation to further analyze its asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>When Do Two Distributions Yield the Same Expected Euler Characteristic Curve in the Thermodynamic Limit?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a probability distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ which admits a bounded density. We investigate the Euler characteristic of the \v{C}ech complex on $n$ points sampled from $F$ i.i.d. as $n\to\infty$ in the thermodynamic limit regime. As a main result, we identify a condition for two probability distributions to yield the same expected Euler characteristic under this construction. Namely, this happens if and only if their densities admit the same excess mass transform. Building on work of Bobrowski, we establish a connection between the limiting expected Euler characteristic of any such probability distribution $F$ and the one of the uniform distribution on $[0,1]^d$ through an integral transform. Our approach relies on constructive proofs, offering explicit calculations of expected Euler characteristics in lower dimensions as well as reconstruction of a distribution from its limiting Euler characteristic. In the context of topological data analysis, where the Euler characteristic serves as a summary of the shape of data, we address the inverse problem and determine what can be discriminated using this invariant. This research sheds light on the relationship between a probability distribution and topological properties of the \v{C}ech complex on its samples in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Time-uniform log-Sobolev inequalities and applications to propagation of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-uniform log-Sobolev inequalities (LSI) satisfied by solutions of semi-linear mean-field equations have recently appeared to be a key tool to obtain time-uniform propagation of chaos estimates. This work addresses the more general settings of time-inhomogeneous Fokker-Planck equations. Time-uniform LSI are obtained in two cases, either with the bounded-Lipschitz perturbation argument with respect to a reference measure, or with a coupling approach at high temperature. These arguments are then applied to mean-field equations, where, on the one hand, sharp marginal propagation of chaos estimates are obtained in smooth cases and, on the other hand, time-uniform global propagation of chaos is shown in the case of vortex interactions with quadratic confinement potential on the whole space. In this second case, an important point is to establish global gradient and Hessian estimates, which is of independent interest. We prove these bounds in the more general situation of non-attractive logarithmic and Riesz singular interactions.</description>

      <title>Fixation of leadership in non-Markovian growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a model where $N$ equal agents possess `values', belonging to $\mathbb{N}_0$, that are subject to incremental growth over time. More precisely, the values of the agents are represented by $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$ valued processes with random, independent waiting times between jumps. We show that the event that a single agent possesses the maximum value for all sufficiently large values of time (called `leadership') occurs with probability zero or one, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur. Under mild conditions we also provide criteria for a single agent to become the unique agent of maximum value for all sufficiently large times, and also conditions for the emergence of a unique agent having value that tends to infinity before `explosion' occurs (i.e. conditions for `strict leadership' or `monopoly' to occur almost surely). The novelty of this model lies in allowing non-exponentially distributed waiting times between jumps in value. In the particular case when waiting times are mixtures of exponential distributions, we improve a well-established result on the `balls in bins' model with feedback, removing the requirement that the feedback function be bounded from below and also allowing random feedback functions. As part of the proofs we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution of a convergent series of independent random variables to have an atom on the real line, a result which we believe may be of interest in its own right.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of infinite-dimensional convex bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we use the second intrinsic volume to define a metric on the space of homothetic classes of Gaussian bounded convex bodies in a separable real Hilbert space. Using kernels of hyperbolic type, we can deduce that this space is isometrically embedded into an infinite-dimensional real hyperbolic space. Applying Malliavin calculus, it is possible to adapt integral geometry for convex bodies in infinite dimensions. Moreover, we give a new formula for computing second intrinsic volumes of convex bodies and offer a description of the completion for the hyperbolic embedding of Gaussian bounded convex bodies with dimension at least two and thus answer a question asked by Debin and Fillastre [DF22].</description>

      <title>Second-Order Approximation of Limit Order Books in a Single-Scale Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a first and second-order approximation for an infinite dimensional limit order book model (LOB) in a single (''critical'') scaling regime where market and limit orders arrive at a common time scale. With our choice of scaling we obtain non-degenerate first-order and second-order approximations for the price and volume dynamics. While the first-order approximation is given by a standard coupled ODE-PDE system, the second-order approximation is non-standard and described in terms of an infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equation driven by a cylindrical Brownian motion. The driving noise processes exhibit a non-trivial correlation in terms of the model parameters. We prove that the evolution equation has a unique solution and that the sequence of standardized LOB models converges weakly to the solution of the evolution equation. The proof uses a non-standard martingale problem. We calibrate a simplified version of our model to market data and show that the model accurately captures correlations between price and volume fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>

      <title>Iterative Improvement of an Additively Regularized Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topic modelling is fundamentally a soft clustering problem (of known objects -- documents, over unknown clusters -- topics). That is, the task is incorrectly posed. In particular, the topic models are unstable and incomplete. All this leads to the fact that the process of finding a good topic model (repeated hyperparameter selection, model training, and topic quality assessment) can be particularly long and labor-intensive. We aim to simplify the process, to make it more deterministic and provable. To this end, we present a method for iterative training of a topic model. The essence of the method is that a series of related topic models are trained so that each subsequent model is at least as good as the previous one, i.e., that it retains all the good topics found earlier. The connection between the models is achieved by additive regularization. The result of this iterative training is the last topic model in the series, which we call the iteratively updated additively regularized topic model (ITAR). Experiments conducted on several collections of natural language texts show that the proposed ITAR model performs better than other popular topic models (LDA, ARTM, BERTopic), its topics are diverse, and its perplexity (ability to "explain" the underlying data) is moderate.</description>

      <title>Shift-Dispersion Decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divergence functions are measures of distance or dissimilarity between probability distributions that serve various purposes in statistics and applications. We propose decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er distances$-$which compare two distributions by integrating over their differences in distribution or quantile functions$-$into directed shift and dispersion components. These components are obtained by dividing the differences between the quantile functions into contributions arising from shift and dispersion, respectively. Our decompositions add information on how the distributions differ in a condensed form and consequently enhance the interpretability of the underlying divergences. We show that our decompositions satisfy a number of natural properties and are unique in doing so in location-scale families. The decompositions allow to derive sensitivities of the divergence measures to changes in location and dispersion, and they give rise to weak stochastic order relations that are linked to the usual stochastic and the dispersive order. Our theoretical developments are illustrated in two applications, where we focus on forecast evaluation of temperature extremes and on the design of probabilistic surveys in economics.</description>
