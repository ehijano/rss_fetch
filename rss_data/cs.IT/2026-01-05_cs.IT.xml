      <title>A repair scheme for a distributed storage system based on multivariate polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed storage system stores data across multiple nodes, with the primary objective of enabling efficient data recovery even in the event of node failures. The main goal of an exact repair scheme is to recover the data from a failed node by accessing and downloading information from the rest of the nodes. In a groundbreaking paper, ~\cite{GW} developed an exact repair scheme for a distributed storage system that is based on Reed-Solomon codes, which depend on single-variable polynomials. In these notes, we extend the repair scheme to the family of distributed storage systems based on Reed-Muller codes, which are linear codes based on multivariate polynomials. The repair scheme we propose repairs any single node failure and multiple node failures, provided the positions satisfy certain conditions.</description>

      <title>The permutation group of Reed-Solomon codes over arbitrary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that the permutation group of a Reed-Solomon code is given by the polynomials of degree one that leave the set of evaluation points invariant. Our results provide a straightforward proof of the well-known cases of the permutation group of the Reed-Solomon code when the set of evaluation points is the whole finite field or the multiplicative group.</description>

      <title>Evolution of UE in Massive MIMO Systems for 6G: From Passive to Active</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless networks continue to evolve, stringent latency and reliability requirements and highly dynamic channels expose fundamental limitations of gNB-centric massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architectures, motivating a rethinking of the user equipment (UE) role. In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.</description>

      <title>Semantic Transmission Framework in Direct Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insufficient link budget has become a bottleneck problem for direct access in current satellite communications. In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher semantic efficiency than baselines.</description>

      <title>On the burst-covering radius of binary cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study burst-covering codes. We provide some general bounds connecting the code parameters with its burst-covering radius. We then provide stronger bounds on the burst-covering radius of cyclic codes, by employing linear-feedback shift-register (LFSR) sequences. For the case of BCH codes we prove a new bound on pattern frequencies in LFSR sequences, which is of independent interest. Using this tool, we can bound the covering-radius of binary primitive BCH codes and Melas codes. We conclude with an efficient algorithm for burst-covering cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>CoCo-Fed: A Unified Framework for Memory- and Communication-Efficient Federated Learning at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large-scale neural networks within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is pivotal for enabling native edge intelligence. However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic. Beyond empirical designs, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation, proving the convergence of CoCo-Fed even under unsupervised learning conditions suitable for wireless sensing tasks. Extensive simulations on an angle-of-arrival estimation task demonstrate that CoCo-Fed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both memory and communication efficiency while maintaining robust convergence under non-IID settings.</description>

      <title>Universal Outlier Hypothesis Testing via Mean- and Median-Based Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal outlier hypothesis testing refers to a hypothesis testing problem where one observes a large number of length-$n$ sequences -- the majority of which are distributed according to the typical distribution $\pi$ and a small number are distributed according to the outlier distribution $\mu$ -- and one wishes to decide, which of these sequences are outliers without having knowledge of $\pi$ and $\mu$. In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $\pi$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\pi$ and $\mu$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $\pi$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\pi$ and $\mu$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.</description>

      <title>Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching for Quantum Error Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.</description>

      <title>Modern Neuromorphic AI: From Intra-Token to Inter-Token Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: This text contains some notes on the Griesmer bound. In particular, we give a geometric proof of the Griesmer bound for the generalized weights and show that a Solomon--Stiffler type construction attains it if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. We also determine the parameters of optimal binary codes for dimensions at most seven and the optimal ternary codes for dimensions at most five.</description>

      <title>When Does Quantum Differential Privacy Compose?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composition is a cornerstone of classical differential privacy, enabling strong end-to-end guarantees for complex algorithms through composition theorems (e.g., basic and advanced). In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).
  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\'enyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\'enyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.
  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>MIMO-AFDM Outperforms MIMO-OFDM in the Face of Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of both multiplicative and additive hardware impairments (HWIs) on multiple-input multiple-output affine frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-AFDM) systems is investigated. For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we solve an open question formulated in the original paper of twisted skew group codes regarding when a twisted skew group code is checkable. Also, we prove that all ideals of dimension 3 over a twisted group algebra are abelian group codes, generalising another previous result over group algebras. Finally, we prove a bound on the dimension and distance of a twisted group code, as well as when such bound is reached.</description>

      <title>DMH-HARQ: Reliable and Open Latency-Constrained Wireless Transport Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme requirements for high reliability and low latency in the upcoming Sixth Generation (6G) wireless networks are challenging the design of multi-hop wireless transport networks. Inspired by the advent of the virtualization concept in the wireless networks design and openness paradigm as fostered by the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance, we target a revolutionary resource allocation scheme to improve the overall transmission efficiency.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic repeat request (ARQ) in multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, and propose a dynamic scheme of multi-hop hybrid ARQ (HARQ), which maximizes the end-to-end (E2E) communication reliability in the wireless transport network. We also propose an integer dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal Dynamic Multi-Hop HARQ (DMH-HARQ) strategy. Constrained within a certain time frame to accomplish E2E transmission, our proposed approach is proven to outperform the conventional listening-based cooperative ARQ, as well as any static HARQ strategy, regarding the E2E reliability. It is applicable without dependence on special delay constraint, and is particularly competitive for long-distance transport network with many hops.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled dual-scale channel estimation framework, where large-scale channel estimation benefits from sensing, and the temporal variation of small-scale channel state information is modeled via channel aging. By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>Considerate Ramp Secret Sharing</title>

Abstract: In this work we revisit the fundamental findings by Chen et al. in [5] on general information transfer in linear ramp secret sharing schemes to conclude that their method not only gives a way to establish worst case leakage [5, 25] and best case recovery [5, 19], but can also lead to additional insight on non-qualifying sets for any prescribed amount of information. We then apply this insight to schemes defined from monomial-Cartesian codes and by doing so we demonstrate that the good schemes from Sec.\ IV in [14] have a second layer of security. Elaborating further, when given a designed recovery number, in a new construction the focus is entirely on ensuring that the access structure possesses desirable second layer security, rather on what is the worst case information leakage in terms of number of participants.The particular structure of largest possible sets being not able to determine any amount of information suggests that we coin the concept of considerate ramp secret sharing schemes of which the proposed new construction is a well-structured example</description>

      <title>Analysis of Semantic Communication for Logic-based Hypothesis Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution of the transmitter at the receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi- round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an $m$-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.</description>

      <title>Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling for Next-Generation Wireless: Principles, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless networks are expected to deliver ultra-high throughput for supporting emerging applications. In such scenarios, conventional Nyquist signaling may falter. As a remedy, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling facilitates the transmission of more symbols than Nyquist signaling without expanding the time-frequency resources. We provide an accessible and structured introduction to FTN signaling, covering its core principles, theoretical foundations, unique advantages, open facets, and its road map. Specifically, we present promising coded FTN results and highlight its compelling advantages in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), an increasingly critical function in future networks. We conclude with a discussion of open research challenges and promising directions.</description>

      <title>When Wires Can't Keep Up: Reconfigurable AI Data Centers Empowered by Terahertz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in modern data centers demands a radical transformation of interconnect architectures. Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions. The article concludes with a roadmap toward wireless-defined, reconfigurable, and sustainable AI data centers.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sum Capacity via Quantum and No-Signaling Cooperation Between Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a communication scenario over a discrete memoryless interference channel or multiple access channel without feedback, where transmitters exploit classical, quantum, or no-signaling cooperation. In this scenario, several previous works have shown that the sum capacities of channels involving pseudo-telepathy games can be enhanced by quantum or no-signaling cooperation. However, a full characterization of which channels admit such an improvement remains open. By focusing on the common characteristics of previously studied channels, we propose a broader class of channels for which quantum or no-signaling cooperation increases the sum capacity. Channels in this class are associated with a pseudo-telepathy game, with channel inputs specified as tuples of questions and answers from the game. In addition, when the channel inputs satisfy the winning condition of the game, the channel decomposes into parallel weakly symmetric sub-channels and is less noisy compared to the case when the inputs do not meet the winning condition.</description>
