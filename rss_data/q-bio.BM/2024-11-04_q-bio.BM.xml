      <title>RapidDock: Unlocking Proteome-scale Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating molecular docking -- the process of predicting how molecules bind to protein targets -- could boost small-molecule drug discovery and revolutionize medicine. Unfortunately, current molecular docking tools are too slow to screen potential drugs against all relevant proteins, which often results in missed drug candidates or unexpected side effects occurring in clinical trials. To address this gap, we introduce RapidDock, an efficient transformer-based model for blind molecular docking. RapidDock achieves at least a $100 \times$ speed advantage over existing methods without compromising accuracy. On the Posebusters and DockGen benchmarks, our method achieves $52.1\%$ and $44.0\%$ success rates ($\text{RMSD}&lt;2$\r{A}), respectively. The average inference time is $0.04$ seconds on a single GPU, highlighting RapidDock's potential for large-scale docking studies. We examine the key features of RapidDock that enable leveraging the transformer architecture for molecular docking, including the use of relative distance embeddings of $3$D structures in attention matrices, pre-training on protein folding, and a custom loss function invariant to molecular symmetries.</description>

      <title>MolCap-Arena: A Comprehensive Captioning Benchmark on Language-Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging biomolecular modeling with natural language information, particularly through large language models (LLMs), has recently emerged as a promising interdisciplinary research area. LLMs, having been trained on large corpora of scientific documents, demonstrate significant potential in understanding and reasoning about biomolecules by providing enriched contextual and domain knowledge. However, the extent to which LLM-driven insights can improve performance on complex predictive tasks (e.g., toxicity) remains unclear. Further, the extent to which relevant knowledge can be extracted from LLMs also remains unknown. In this study, we present Molecule Caption Arena: the first comprehensive benchmark of LLM-augmented molecular property prediction. We evaluate over twenty LLMs, including both general-purpose and domain-specific molecule captioners, across diverse prediction tasks. To this goal, we introduce a novel, battle-based rating system. Our findings confirm the ability of LLM-extracted knowledge to enhance state-of-the-art molecular representations, with notable model-, prompt-, and dataset-specific variations. Code, resources, and data are available at github.com/Genentech/molcap-arena.</description>

      <title>E(3)-invariant diffusion model for pocket-aware peptide generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biologists frequently desire protein inhibitors for a variety of reasons, including use as research tools for understanding biological processes and application to societal problems in agriculture, healthcare, etc. Immunotherapy, for instance, relies on immune checkpoint inhibitors to block checkpoint proteins, preventing their binding with partner proteins and boosting immune cell function against abnormal cells. Inhibitor discovery has long been a tedious process, which in recent years has been accelerated by computational approaches. Advances in artificial intelligence now provide an opportunity to make inhibitor discovery smarter than ever before. While extensive research has been conducted on computer-aided inhibitor discovery, it has mainly focused on either sequence-to-structure mapping, reverse mapping, or bio-activity prediction, making it unrealistic for biologists to utilize such tools. Instead, our work proposes a new method of computer-assisted inhibitor discovery: de novo pocket-aware peptide structure and sequence generation network. Our approach consists of two sequential diffusion models for end-to-end structure generation and sequence prediction. By leveraging angle and dihedral relationships between backbone atoms, we ensure an E(3)-invariant representation of peptide structures. Our results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, highlighting its potential in pocket-aware peptide design. This work offers a new approach for precise drug discovery using receptor-specific peptide generation.</description>
