      <title>R\'enyi entropy of the permutationally invariant part of the ground state across a quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the permutationally invariant part of the density matrix (PIDM) in capturing the properties of the ground state of the system during a quantum phase transition. In the context of quantum state tomography, PIDM is known to be obtainable with only a low number of measurement settings, namely $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$, where $L$ is the system size. Considering the transverse-field Ising chain as an example, we compute the second-order R\'enyi entropy of PIDM for the ground state by using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. In the ferromagnetic case, the ground state is permutationally invariant both in the limits of zero and infinite field, leading to vanishing R\'enyi entropy of PIDM. The latter exhibits a broad peak as a function of the transverse field around the quantum critical point, which gets more pronounced for larger system size. In the antiferromagnetic case, the peak structure disappears and the R\'enyi entropy diverges like $\mathcal{O}(L)$ in the whole field range of the ordered phase. We discuss the cause of these behaviors of the R\'enyi entropy of PIDM, examining the possible application of this experimentally tractable quantity to the analysis of phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional XY Ferromagnet Induced by Long-range Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossover between short-range and long-range (LR) universal behaviors remains a central theme in the physics of long-range interacting systems. The competition between LR coupling and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism makes the problem more subtle and less understood in the two-dimensional (2D) XY model, a cornerstone for investigating low-dimensional phenomena and their implications in quantum computation. We study the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interaction $\sim1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Utilizing an advanced update strategy, we conduct large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the model up to a linear size of $L=8192$. Our results demonstrate continuous phase transitions into a ferromagnetic phase for $\sigma \leq 2$, which exhibits the simultaneous emergence of a long-ranged order and a power-law decaying correlation function due to the Goldstone mode. Furthermore, we find logarithmic scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase at $\sigma = 2$. The observed scaling behaviors in the low-temperature phase for $\sigma \le 2$ agree with our theoretical analysis. Our findings request further theoretical understandings and can be of practical application in cutting-edge experiments like Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes of the one-dimensional phase turbulence in the deterministic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase turbulence of the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, in which the defect-free chaotic dynamics of the order parameter maps to a phase equation well approximated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model. In this regime, the behaviour of the large wavelength modes is captured by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, determining universal scaling and statistical properties. We present numerical evidence of the existence of an additional scale-invariant regime, with dynamical scaling exponent $z=1$, emerging at scales which are intermediate between the microscopic, intrinsic to the modulational instability, and the macroscopic ones. We argue that this new regime is a signature of the universality class corresponding to the inviscid limit of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations and optimization above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows coherent control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as digitized quantum annealing and match the results of a 133-site optimization, where we identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step.</description>

      <title>Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP ($\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero. The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter systems being in a non-equilibrium state, exhibit complex behaviors such as self-organization and giving rise to emergent phenomena. There are many examples of active particles with biological origins, including bacteria and spermatozoa, or with artificial origins, such as self-propelled swimmers and Janus particles. The ability to manipulate active particles is vital for their effective application e.g. separating motile spermatozoa from nonmotile and dead ones, to increase fertilization chance. In this study, we proposed a mechanism -- an apparatus -- to sort and demix active particles based on their motility values (P\`eclet number). Initially, using Brownian simulations we demonstrated the feasibility of sorting self-propelled particles. Following this, we employed machine learning methods, supplemented with data from comprehensive simulations that we conducted for this study, to model the complex behavior of active particles. This enabled us to sort them based on their P\`eclet number. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the developed models and showed their effectiveness in demixing and sorting the active particles. Our findings can find applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and biomedical science, where the sorting and manipulation of active particles play a pivotal role.</description>

      <title>Polarisable soft solvent models with applications in dissipative particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically examine a broad class of explicitly polarisable soft solvent models aimed at applications in dissipative particle dynamics. We obtain the dielectric permittivity using the fluctuating box dipole method in linear response theory, and verify the models in relation to several test cases including demonstrating ion desorption from an oil-water interface due to image charge effects. We additionally compute the Kirkwood factor and find it uniformly lies in the range gK approx 0.7-0.8, indicating that dipole-dipole correlations are not negligible in these models. This is supported by measurements of dipole-dipole correlation functions. As a consequence, Onsager theory over-predicts the dielectric permittivity by approximately 20-30 percent. On the other hand, the mean square molecular dipole moment can be accurately estimated with a first-order Wertheim perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hydrodynamics for the Volterra lattice: Ballistic and nonballistic behavior of correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a lot of effort has been put in describing the hydrodynamic behavior of integrable systems. In this paper, we describe such picture for the Volterra lattice. Specifically, we are able to explicitly compute the susceptibility matrix and the current-field correlation matrix in terms of the density of states of the Volterra lattice endowed with a Generalized Gibbs ensemble. Furthermore, we apply the theory of linear Generalized Hydrodynamics to describe the Euler scale behavior of the correlation functions. We anticipate that the solution to the Generalized Hydrodynamics equations develops shocks at $\xi_0=\frac{x}{t}$; so this linear approximation does not fully describe the behavior of correlation functions. Intrigued but this fact, we performed several numerical investigations which show that, exactly when the solution to the hydrodynamic equations develops shock, the correlation functions show an highly oscillatory behavior. In view of this empirical observation, we believe that at this point $\xi_0$ the diffusive contribution are not sub-leading corrections to the ballistic transport, but they are of the same order.</description>

      <title>Functional reducibility of higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical complex systems are widely assumed to be characterized not only by pairwise interactions, but also by higher-order (group) interactions that affect collective phenomena, from metabolic reactions to epidemics. Nevertheless, higher-order networks' superior descriptive power -- compared to classical pairwise networks -- comes with a much increased model complexity and computational cost. Consequently, it is of paramount importance to establish a quantitative method to determine when such a modeling framework is advantageous with respect to pairwise models, and to which extent it provides a parsimonious description of empirical systems. Here, we propose a principled method, based on information compression, to analyze the reducibility of higher-order networks to lower-order interactions, by identifying redundancies in diffusion processes while preserving the relevant functional information. The analysis of a broad spectrum of empirical systems shows that, although some networks contain non-compressible group interactions, others can be effectively approximated by lower-order interactions -- some technological and biological systems even just by pairwise interactions. More generally, our findings mark a significant step towards minimizing the dimensionality of models for complex systems</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>Sliding down the stairs: how correlated latent variables accelerate learning with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using online SGD grows as $d^{p-1}$, which is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently. Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples required by a single neuron to weakly-recover these directions using online SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical learning in neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been devoted to microscopic heat engines in both theoretical and experimental aspects. Notably, the fundamental limits pertaining to power and efficiency, as well as the tradeoff relations between these two quantities, have been intensively studied. This study aims to shed further light on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the relationship between the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines operating at arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We establish a tradeoff relation between power and efficiency using the geometric length and the timescale of the heat engine. Remarkably, because the geometric quantity comprises experimentally accessible terms in classical cases, this relation is useful for the inference of thermodynamic efficiency. Moreover, we reveal that the power of a heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its geometric length and the statistics of energy. Our results provide a geometric characterization of the performance of cyclic heat engines, which is universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines operating far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric $K$-exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an interacting particle process on a finite ring with $L$ sites with at most $K$ particles per site, in which particles hop to nearest neighbors with rates given in terms of $t$-deformed integers and asymmetry parameter $q$, where $t&gt;0$ and $q \geq 0$ are parameters. This model, which we call the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP, reduces to the usual ASEP on the ring when $K = 1$ and to a model studied by Sch\"utz and Sandow (\emph{Phys. Rev. E}, 1994) when $t = q = 1$. This is a special case of the misanthrope process and as a consequence, the steady state does not depend on $q$ and is of product form, generalizing the same phenomena for the ASEP. What is interesting here is the steady state weights are given by explicit formulas involving $t$-binomial coefficients, and are palindromic polynomials in $t$. Interestingly, although the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP does not satisfy particle-hole symmetry, its steady state does. We analyze the density and calculate the most probable number of particles at a site in the steady state in various regimes of $t$. Lastly, we construct a two-dimensional exclusion process on a discrete cylinder with height $K$ and circumference $L$ which projects to the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP and whose steady state distribution is also of product form. We believe this model will serve as an illustrative example in constructing two-dimensional analogues of misanthrope processes.

      <title>Hidden nonreciprocity as a stabilizing effective potential in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter with nonreciprocal interactions is known for its distinctive dynamics. To shed light on the stationary properties of such systems, we consider paradigmatic systems of nonreciprocally coupled active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. For each system, we uniquely decompose the interparticle force into an energy gradient and a transverse nonconservative force. We show that the steady-state distribution of positions, which would only reflect the energy if the noise were thermal, features the transverse force as an effective potential that stabilizes the energy minima, due to the persistent noise that propels the particles. We exactly solve the distribution for nonreciprocal harmonic oscillators and numerically verify it for systems with more complex couplings. When the breaking of reciprocity in the interactions produces a transverse force without changing the energy gradient, we indeed find that the nonreciprocity plays a stabilizing role in the stationary state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of what is meant by a meanfield. Meanfields are approximately maps - through some self consistency relation - of a complex, usually manybody, problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. This mapping can then be solved to represent properties of the complex many body problem using some self consistency relations. Prototypical examples of simpler meanfield problems (meanfield systems) are the single site and free particle problems. Here we propose a new class of simple meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain. These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models, where there is a 3D system composed of weakly coupled 1D spin chains with the coupling in the transverse direction weaker than in the 1D direction. We illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising (of any coupling sign) and ferromagnetic Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. We also consider more exotic models to illustrate other methods of solving 1D systems, namely the $N$-state Potts model. Magnetic phase transition temperatures and are obtained for all three models, we see that they significantly differ from the usual meanfield estimates. Indeed if the 1D direction has coupling $\Gamma$ and the transverse directions have coupling $J$ with $\lambda\sim\frac{\Gamma}{J}\gg1$ then regular meanfield would predict the transition temperature to be $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\Gamma$ for all three models while 1D meanfield predicts temperatures of $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\log\left(\lambda\right)}$ for the Ising and Potts models and $k_{B}T_{c}\sim\frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{\lambda}}$ for the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. Cluster 1D meanfield extensions are also proposed.</description>

      <title>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.</description>

      <title>Entropy production and fluctuation theorems for monitored quantum systems under imperfect detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic behavior of Markovian open quantum systems can be described at the level of fluctuations by using continuous monitoring approaches. However, practical applications require assessing imperfect detection schemes, where the definition of main thermodynamic quantities becomes subtle and universal fluctuation relations are unknown. Here we fill this gap by deriving a universal fluctuation relation that links entropy production in ideal and in inefficient monitoring setups. This provides a suitable estimator of dissipation using imperfect detection records that lower bounds the underlying entropy production at the level of single trajectories. We illustrate our findings with a driven-dissipative two-level system following quantum jump trajectories.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistical mechanics from a Bohmian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general formulation of quantum statistical mechanics in terms of probability currents that satisfy continuity equations in the multi-particle position space, for closed and open systems with a fixed number of particles. The continuity equation for any closed or open system suggests a natural Bohmian interpretation in terms of microscopic particle trajectories, that make the same measurable predictions as standard quantum theory. The microscopic trajectories are not directly observable, but provide a general, simple and intuitive microscopic interpretation of macroscopic phenomena in quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss how various notions of entropy, proper and improper mixtures, and thermodynamics are understood from the Bohmian perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate eigenvalue attraction for open quantum systems, biophysical systems, and for Parity-Time symmetric materials. To determine whether an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate of a real matrix attract, we derive expressions for the second derivative of eigenvalues, which is dependent upon contributions from inertial forces, attraction between an eigenvalue and its complex conjugate, as well as the force of the remaining eigenvalues in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Many-body entanglement and spectral clusters in the extended hard-core bosonic Hatano-Nelson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-body entanglements and spectra of the extended bosonic Hatano-Nelson model in the hard-core limit. We show that the system undergoes a phase transition from a gapless phase to a charge density wave phase accompanied by a $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in the first excited state. The phase transition is characterized by the crossing of the ground-state biorthogonal order parameter and the sudden change of the first excited-state entanglement entropy. The gapless phase is verified by the logarithmic scaling of the ground-state entanglement entropy with the central charge $c=1$. Furthermore, we show that all energy spectral clusters would form ellipses in strong nearest-neighbor interactions, for which we establish a universal scaling law. The lengths of the major and minor axes are shown to obey power laws with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction. The exact expressions are derived for the numbers of energy levels on the outermost elliptic ring of each clusters.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Volume-entangled exact eigenstates in the PXP and related models in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report first exact volume-entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type scar states hosted by PXP and related Hamiltonians corresponding to various geometric configurations of Rydberg-blockaded atom systems, including the most extensively studied ones such as the chain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and square lattice. We start by introducing a new zero-energy eigenstate of the PBC chain and proceed by generalizing it to a wide variety of geometries and Hamiltonians. We point out the experimental relevance of such states by providing a concrete and feasible protocol for their preparation on near-term Rydberg quantum devices, which relies only on strictly local measurements and evolution under native Hamiltonians. We also demonstrate the utility of these states for the study of quantum dynamics by describing a simple protocol for measuring infinite-temperature out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) functions.</description>
