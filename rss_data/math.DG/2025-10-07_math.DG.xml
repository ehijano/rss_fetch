      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of certain real algebraic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note is given an algebraic solution to the problem 1997-6 proposed by D. A. Panov in the list of Arnold's problems \cite{Arnld2b}. In particular, it is shown that there does not exist a real polynomial function $f$ on the real euclidean plane, whose Hessian is positive in an open set bordered by smooth connected curve, and the parabolic curve of the graph of $f$ has only one special parabolic point with index $+1$. Besides, we find conditions on $f$ so that its graph has more special parabolic points with index -1 than with index +1.</description>

      <title>Tensor tomography on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform $I_m$ over symmetric $m$-tensor fields on asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces. This operator has a non-trivial kernel whenever $m\ge 1$. To propose a gauge representative to be reconstructed from X-ray data, we first prove a "tt-potential-conformal" decomposition theorem for $m$-tensor fields (where "tt" stands for transverse traceless), previously used in integral geometry on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary in Sharafutdinov, 2007; Dairbekov and Sharafutdinov, 2011. The proof is based on elliptic decompositions of the Guillemin-Kazhdan operators $\eta_\pm$ (Guillemin and Kazhdan, 1980) and leverages in the current setting the 0-calculus of Mazzeo-Melrose (Mazzeo and Melrose, 1987; Mazzeo, 1991). Iterating this decomposition gives rise to an "iterated-tt" representative modulo $\ker I_m$ for a tensor field, which is distinct from the often-used solenoidal representative.
  In the case of the Poincar\'e disk, we show that the X-ray transform of a tensor in iterated-tt form splits into components that are orthogonal relative to a specific $L^2$ structure in data space. For even tensor fields, we provide a full picture of the data space decomposition, in particular a range characterization of $I_{2n}$ for every $n$ in terms of moment conditions and spectral decay. Finally, we give explicit approaches for the reconstruction of even tensors in iterated-tt form from their X-ray transform or its normal operator, using specific knowledge of geodesically invariant distributions with one-sided Fourier content, whose properties are analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Nonhomothetic complete periodic metrics with constant scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are infinitely many pairwise nonhomothetic, complete, periodic metrics with constant scalar curvature that are conformal to the round metric on $S^n\setminus S^k$, where $k &lt; \frac{n-2}{2}$. These metrics are obtained by pulling back Yamabe metrics defined on products of $S^{n-k-1}$ and compact hyperbolic $(k+1)$-manifolds. Our main result proves that these solutions are generically distinct up to homothety. The core of our argument relies on classical rigidity theorems due to Obata and Ferrand, which characterize the round sphere by its conformal group.</description>

      <title>The moduli spaces of left-invariant statistical structures on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of information geometry, the concept known as left-invariant statistical structure on Lie groups is defined by Furuhata--Inoguchi--Kobayashi [Inf. Geom. (2021)]. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the moduli space of left-invariant statistical structures on a Lie group. We study the moduli spaces for three particular Lie groups, each of which has a moduli space of left-invariant Riemannian metrics that is a singleton. As applications, we classify left-invariant conjugate symmetric statistical structures and left-invariant dually flat structures (which are equivalently left-invariant Hessian structures) on these three Lie groups. A characterization of the Amari--Chentsov $\alpha$-connections on the Takano Gaussian space is also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider simply connected Riemannian manifolds without conjugate points for which the horospherical mean curvature function is continuous, reversible and invariant under the geodesic flow. We show under mild additional curvature tensor conditions that rank one manifolds in this family are automatically asymptotically harmonic. In particular, compact rank one manifolds of this kind must be locally symmetric spaces of negative curvature. Moreover, we show under the same conditions that rank one D'Atri spaces without conjugate points are harmonic. An earlier result of this type was proved by Druetta for certain homogeneous D'Atri spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Poisson equation for the $G_2$-Laplacian on 3-forms on the 7-sphere that are invariant under a transitive group action. We establish the existence and uniqueness of $G$-invariant solutions for $G=SU(4),\: Spin(7),\: (Sp(2)\times Sp(1))/\mathbb{Z}_2$. In the case $G=Sp(2)\times U(1)/\mathbb{Z}_2$, we show that the operator does not preserve the set of positive 3-forms. The paper also discusses the eigenvalue problem for the $G_2$-Laplacian. We classify $G$-invariant solutions for the above choices of $G$ and determine which of these solutions are nearly parallel $G_2$-structures.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Einstein 4-manifolds with conformally K\"ahler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 4-dimensional Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds whose conformal class contains a K\"ahler metric. Such Einstein metrics are non-K\"ahler and admit a Killing field extending to the conformal infinity, and the Einstein equation reduces to a Toda-type equation. When the Killing field integrates to an $\mathbb{S}^1$-action, we formulate a Dirichlet boundary value problem and establish existence and uniqueness theory. This construction provides a non-perturbative realization of infinite-dimensional families of new Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics whose conformal infinities are of non-positive Yamabe type.</description>

      <title>Curvature pinching of asymptotically conical gradient expanding Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the well-known work of Hamilton [62] and Ivey [64], the Hamilton-Ivey curvature pinching and its generalizations have become a signature feature of gradient shrinking and steady Ricci solitons, and more generally, of ancient solutions to the Ricci flow. However, analogous results for gradient expanding Ricci solitons have remained elusive. This is largely due to the fact that the proofs of existing curvature pinching estimates crucially rely on shrinking and steady solitons being ancient, a property not shared by gradient Ricci expanders. In this paper, we investigate curvature pinching phenomena of non-compact asymptotically conical gradient expanding Ricci solitons and establish several Hamilton-Ivey type curvature pinching estimates. These results are parallel to those known for shrinking and steady Ricci solitons. In particular, we prove a three-dimensional Hamilton-Ivey type curvature pinching theorem: any three-dimensional non-compact, asymptotically conical, gradient Ricci expander with positive scalar curvature must have positive sectional curvature. As an application, we combine our result with that of Deruelle [51] to establish a uniqueness theorem for three-dimensional asymptotically conical expanders with positive scalar curvature. Furthermore, we prove a curvature pinching result for four-dimensional asymptotically conical Ricci expanders with uniformly positive isotropic curvature, analogous to a result for four-dimensional gradient steady solitons due to Brendle [7].</description>

      <title>Bulk Weyl Asymptotics in the Edge Variable under Affine Spectral Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Tauberian transfer principle showing that for any compact closed Riemannian manifold $(M^d,g)$ the affine spectral encoding $C=\pi-\epsilon\lambda$ transports Laplacian Weyl asymptotics to a Weyl law in the edge variable in the bulk regime $C\to-\infty$ (equivalently, $(\pi-C)/\epsilon\to\infty$): $N_{\mu_C}(C)\sim \gamma_d \epsilon^{-d/2}(\pi-C)^{d/2}$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{bulk}}(C)\sim \frac{d}{2}\gamma_d \epsilon^{-d/2}(\pi-C)^{(d-2)/2}$, so that $d$ and the Weyl constant $\gamma_d$ are recoverable from one-dimensional edge-variable data. Conversely, a bulk power law $N_{\mu_C}(C)\sim A(\pi-C)^\alpha$ as $C\to-\infty$ implies $d=2\alpha$ and $\gamma_d=A\epsilon^{d/2}$. We establish the uniqueness of the affine rule among polynomial-type encodings $g(\lambda)=a-b\lambda^{k}L(\lambda)$ (the edge-variable exponent forces $k=1$) and stability under small perturbations $C=\pi-\epsilon\lambda+\delta(\lambda)$ with $\delta(\lambda)=o(\lambda)$. For constant-curvature model spaces we record strengthened correspondences for heat traces and spectral zeta, $H_{\mathrm{edge}}(s)=\Theta_\Delta(\epsilon s)$ and $\zeta_{\mathrm{edge}}(u)=\epsilon^{-u}\zeta_\Delta(u)$, and we realize multiplicities via generalized one-dimensional models (Krein strings). When a Weyl remainder $O(\Lambda^{(d-1)/2})$ is available, it transfers to a bulk remainder $O((\pi-C)^{(d-1)/2})$ in the $C$-variable.</description>

Abstract: In this work, it is shown that there is no potential function on the Weilbull statistical manifold.

      <description>arXiv:2510.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an inverse curvature flow of $\ell$-convex Legendre curves. Since the Legendre curve is a natural generalization of regular curve, the flow is a generalization of the classical inverse curvature flow of regular curves. For the initial value problem, we study on the unique existence of the flow in global time, the monotonicity of the number of the singular cusps with respect to t &gt; 0 and the asymptotic behavior of the flow as $t \to \infty$. Regarding the asymptotics, the flow asymptotically converges to one of the self similar solutions by scaling appropriately, and the convergence is completely categorized depending on the initial curve.</description>

      <title>Geometric Mechanics of Thin Periodic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin surfaces are ubiquitous in nature, from leaves to cell membranes, and in technology, from paper to corrugated containers. Structural thinness imbues them with flexibility, the ability to easily bend under light loads, even as their much higher stretching stiffness can bear substantial stresses. When surfaces have periodic patterns of either smooth hills and valleys or sharp origami-like creases this can substantially modify their mechanical response. We show that for any such surface, there is a duality between the surface rotations of an isometric deformation and the in-plane stresses of a force-balanced configuration. This duality means that of the six possible combinations of global in-plane strain and out-of-plane bending, exactly three must be isometries. We show further that stressed configurations can be expressed in terms of both the applied deformation and the isometric deformation that is dual to the pattern of stress that arises. We identify constraints rooted in symplectic geometry on the three isometries that a single surface can generate. This framework sheds new light on the fundamental limits of the mechanical response of thin periodic surfaces, while also highlighting the role that continuum differential geometry plays in even sharply creased origami surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.04212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When trying to cast the free fermion in the framework of functorial field theory, its chiral anomaly manifests in the fact that it assigns the determinant of the Dirac operator to a top-dimensional closed spin manifold, which is not a number as expected, but an element of a complex line. In functorial field theory language, this means that the theory is twisted, which gives rise to an anomaly theory. In this paper, we give a detailed construction of this anomaly theory, as a functor that sends manifolds to infinite-dimensional Clifford algebras and bordisms to bimodules.</description>

      <title>Closed $G_2$-Structures with Negative Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study existence problems for closed $G_2$-structures with negative Ricci curvature, and we prove the $G_2$-Goldberg conjecture for noncompact manifolds. We first show that no closed manifold admits a closed $G_2$-structure with negative Ricci curvature. In the noncompact setting, we show that no complete manifold admits a closed $G_2$-structure with Ricci curvature pinched sufficiently close to a negative constant. As a consequence, an Einstein closed $G_2$-structure on a complete manifold must be torsion-free. In addition, when the Einstein metric is incomplete, we find restrictions on lengths of geodesics.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Realization of Spherical T-Duality via $\star$-Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between two distinct frameworks for constructing and relating smooth manifolds: the geometric theory of \emph{$\star$-diagrams} and the string-theory-inspired notion of \emph{spherical T-duality}. We prove that for linear $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over the 4-sphere, the existence of a $\star$-diagram connecting two such bundles is equivalent to them forming a spherical T-dual pair. This result provides a concrete geometric realization of spherical T-duality, interpreting its abstract cohomological definitions in the language of differential geometry.
  To forge this connection, we introduce a higher-dimensional generalization of \emph{logarithmic transformations}. These topological surgeries change the diffeomorphism type of the homology $\Sigma\times \mathrm{S}^1$, where $\Sigma$ is a homotopy sphere. Forgetting the $\mathrm{S}^1$-factor, they realize the constructed spherical T-dualities. Furthermore, we show that the known isomorphisms in the equivariant K-theory and cohomology between the T-dual manifolds are a direct consequence of an underlying \emph{Morita equivalence} between the action groupoids naturally associated with the base manifolds in a $\star$-diagram.</description>

Abstract: We construct a van Est map for strict Lie 2-groups from the Bott-Shulman-Stasheff double complex of the strict Lie 2-group to the Weil algebra of its associated strict Lie 2-algebra. We show that, under appropriate connectedness assumptions, this map induces isomorphisms in cohomology. As an application, we differentiate the Segal 2-form on the loop group.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of the Bigolin complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold, we study the cohomology and the Hodge theory for the elliptic complex of differential forms defined by Bigolin in 1969 and recently referred to as the Schweitzer complex. Recall that the double complex of a compact complex manifold decomposes into a direct sum of so-called squares and zigzags, and the zigzags are the only components contributing to cohomology. The main result of this paper states that in complex dimension 3, the multiplicities of zigzags in this decomposition are completely characterised by Betti, Hodge, Aeppli numbers plus Bigolin numbers, namely the dimensions of the Bigolin cohomology. The result is sharp, meaning that if we remove Hodge or Bigolin numbers from the previous statement then it becomes false. In addition, we compute the Bigolin cohomology on the small deformations of the complex structure of the Iwasawa manifold, and then apply the main theorem to fully describe the double complexes of all the small deformations. We also prove a Hodge decomposition for Bigolin harmonic forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds of any dimension. Finally, we partially extend the definition of this complex on almost complex manifolds, providing a cohomological invariant on $1$-forms which is finite when the manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>On the application of Lorentz-Finsler geometry to model wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in the study of Lorentz-Finsler geometry has led to several applications to model real-world physical phenomena. Our purpose is to provide a simple, step-by-step review on how to build and implement such a geometric model to describe the propagation of a classical wave satisfying Fermat's and Huygens' principles in an anisotropic and rheonomic (time-dependent) medium. The model is based on identifying the individual wave trajectories as lightlike pregeodesics of a specific Lorentz-Finsler metric, which obey a simple ODE system and can therefore be easily computed in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new families of four-dimensional Ricci solitons of cohomogeneity two with volume collapsing ends. In a local presentation of the metric conformal to a product, we reduce the soliton equation to a degenerate Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for the conformal factor coupled with ODEs. We obtain explicit complete expanding solitons as well as abstract existence results for shrinking and steady solitons with boundary. These families of Ricci solitons specialize to classical examples of Einstein and soliton metrics. We also classify local solutions of this Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation to prove rigidity for these solitons.</description>

      <title>Some structure theorems for Weingarten surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ be a properly embedded, connected, complete surface with boundary a convex planar curve $C$, satisfying an elliptic equation $H=f(H^2-K)$, where $H$ and $K$ are the mean and the Gauss curvature respectively - which we will refer to as Weingarten equation. When $M$ is contained in one of the two halfspaces determined by $C$, we give sufficient conditions for $M$ to inherit the symmetries of $C$. In particular, when $M$ is vertically cylindrically bounded, we get that $M$ is rotational if $C$ is a circle. In the case in which the Weingarten equation is linear, we give a sufficient condition for such a surface to be contained in a halfspace. Both results are generalizations of results of Rosenberg and Sa Earp, for constant mean curvature surfaces, to the Weingarten setting. In particular, our results also recover and generalize the constant mean curvature case.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the topological complexity of manifolds with a lower scalar curvature bound. We introduce a small scale index theorem to establish an upper bound for Gromov's simplicial norm of the Poincar\'e dual of the A-hat class for manifolds with spin universal covering. The bound depends on a scalar curvature lower bound, injectivity radius, and volume. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem and as a scalar curvature analogue to Cheeger finiteness theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a simplified exposition of the celebrated Aubin-Yau proof for the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics is provided. For the case of a compact K\"ahler manifold with vanishing first Chern class, the analysis presents an alternative formulation of the $C^0$ a priori estimate. Instead of relying on the $L^{\infty}$ norm of the K\"ahler potential $F$ as in the original proof, a different uniform bound for the solution to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation that depends only on the $L^{p}$ norm of $e^{F}$ is established. This estimate has a stronger version established by Ko{\l}odziej in 1998.</description>

      <title>Autoparallelity of Quantum Statistical Manifolds in Light of Quantum Estimation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the autoparallelity w.r.t. the e-connection for an information-geometric structure called the SLD structure, which consists of a Riemannian metric and mutually dual e- and m-connections, induced on the manifold of strictly positive density operators. Unlike the classical information geometry, the e-connection has non-vanishing torsion, which brings various mathematical difficulties. The notion of e-autoparallel submanifolds is regarded as a quantum version of exponential families in classical statistics, which is known to be characterized as statistical models having efficient estimators (unbiased estimators uniformly achieving the equality in the Cramer-Rao inequality). As quantum extensions of this classical result, we present two different forms of estimation-theoretical characterizations of the e-autoparallel submanifolds. We also give several results on the e-autoparallelity, some of which are valid for the autoparallelity w.r.t. an affine connection in a more general geometrical situation.</description>

      <title>The Fisher metric as a metric on the cotangent bundle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher metric on a manifold of probability distributions is usually treated as a metric on the tangent bundle. In this paper, we focus on the metric on the cotangent bundle induced from the Fisher metric with calling it the Fisher co-metric. We show that the Fisher co-metric can be defined directly without going through the Fisher metric by establishing a natural correspondence between cotangent vectors and random variables. This definition clarifies a close relation between the Fisher co-metric and the variance/covariance of random variables, whereby the Cram\'{e}r-Rao inequality is trivialized. We also discuss the monotonicity and the invariance of the Fisher co-metric with respect to Markov maps, and present a theorem characterizing the co-metric by the invariance, which can be regarded as a cotangent version of \v{C}encov's characterization theorem for the Fisher metric. The obtained theorem can also viewed as giving a characterization of the variance/covariance.</description>

      <title>Reverse Isoperimetric Properties of Thick $\lambda$-Concave Bodies in the Hyperbolic Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the reverse isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies with uniform curvature constraints in the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. We prove that the\textit{ thick $\lambda$-sausage} body, that is, the convex domain bounded by two equal circular arcs of curvature $\lambda$ and two equal arcs of hypercircle of curvature $1 / \lambda$, is the unique minimizer of area among all bodies $K \subset \mathbb{H}^2$ with a given length and with curvature of $\partial K$ satisfying $1 / \lambda \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$ (in a weak sense). We call this class of bodies \textit{thick $\lambda$-concave} bodies, in analogy to the Euclidean case where a body is $\lambda$-concave if $0 \leq \kappa \leq \lambda$. The main difficulty in the hyperbolic setting is that the inner parallel bodies of a convex body are not necessarily convex. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an extra assumption of thickness $\kappa \geq 1/\lambda$.</description>

As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>Important Classes of Morphisms and the Relative Cotangent Sequence in Tangent Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, their properties, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class appears in algebraic geometry, differential geometry, algebra, and in Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. In particular, we use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category.</description>
