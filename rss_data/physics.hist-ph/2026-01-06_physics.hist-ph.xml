      <title>Tractatus de Conscientia: A Tractatus-Style Sketch Toward a Modern, Physically Operational Theory of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tractatus de Conscientia is a tractatus-style sketch toward a modern, physically operational account of consciousness. It is also a tractatus-style attempt to talk about consciousness in a way that stays close to what we can actually test and build. It pushes back against two common moves: treating consciousness as a mysterious extra "stuff," and treating it as nothing more than outward behavior. The central idea is to keep three things separate: what appears for an agent (the lived "given"), what is accessible (what can shape report, control, memory, or other records), and what structure remains when we change descriptions (the invariants of organization). On this view, a conscious episode isn't a mathematical instant. It has a short duration during which many internal distinctions are pulled together into one perspective and held stable enough to guide action--and sometimes to be reported. Unity is captured as a kind of "whole-over-parts" surplus: the system, over a chosen timescale and partition, carries more integrated predictive power than its pieces considered separately, and that surplus must also be available to access channels (so we don't count integration that never makes a difference to anything the agent can do or say). The self, in turn, is treated less like a hidden entity and more like a dynamical role--a self-index that helps bind episodes over time by stabilizing prediction and control across changing contexts. The tractatus also stresses a hard limit: every piece of evidence about consciousness requires coupling to the system, and coupling changes what we observe. So there is no protocol-free, perfectly private "identifier" of what-it-is-like. Consciousness is something we infer and attribute under explicit measurement setups, conventions, and uncertainty bounds--and we should be willing to say "we can't tell" when identifiability runs out.</description>

      <title>Statistical Contextual Explanation of Quantum Paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We celebrate this year hundred years of quantum mechanics but there is still no consensus regarding its interpretation and limitations. In this article we advocate the statistical contextual interpretation which is free of paradoxes. State vectors and various operators are purely mathematical entities allowing making quantitative probabilistic predictions. State vector describes an ensemble of identically prepared physical systems and a specific operator represents a class of equivalent measurements of a physical observable. A collapse of wave function is not a mysterious and instantaneous physical process. A collapsed quantum state describes a new ensemble of physical systems prepared in a particular way. Probabilities are objective properties of random experiments in which empirical frequencies stabilize. Therefore, quantum probabilities do not provide a complete description of individual physical systems and their interactions. Whether these probabilities can be explained as emergent is an open question which cannot be settled by philosophical discussions and no-go theorems. It can be only answered by more detailed study of experimental data then it is usually done. Bell Tests allowed rejecting Bell local and Bell causal hidden variable models but we even don't know whether quantum probabilities provide a complete description of existing experimental data. Time series of experimental data may contain much more information than it is obtained using empirical frequencies and histograms. Therefore, predictable completeness of quantum mechanics has be tested and not taken for granted.</description>

      <title>A new kind of science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss whether science is in the process of being transformed from a quest for causality to a quest for correlation in light of the recent development in artificial intelligence. We observe that while a blind trust in the most seductive promises of AI is surely to be avoided, a judicious combination of computer simulation based on physical insight and the machine learning ability to explore ultra-dimensional spaces, holds potential for transformative progress in the way science is going to be pursued in the years to come.</description>

      <title>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</description>

      <title>Tractatus Quanticum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a re-editing, which takes quantum mechanics into account, of Wittgenstein's famous Tractatus. The operation has a playful side in the form, but is a serious attempt to capture possible philosophical implications of the Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and formalize the naturalistic third-way between realism and instrumentalism explored by this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Mathematics in the liturgical books of the Catholic Church: phases of the ecclesiastical moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use contemporary mathematical notation to describe the method for determining the age of the ecclesiastical moon as mandated by pope Gregory XIII and elaborated in the book of Christopher Clavius \emph{Romani calendarii explicatio}. The algorithm is first introduced by using the tabular method employed by liturgical books such as the Roman Missal, Breviary and Martyrology. Then we construct the recurrence equation for the epacts, derive its solution, and give a simple expression for the age of the moon on a given day of the year. We also consider the problems which can occur at the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year, when there could be a ``jump'' in moon's age ("saltus lunae") in years when epact corrections are applied. We propose a simple solution which fixes these problems. A summary of the formulae and listing of the implementation of relevant functions in Python is provided in the last section.</description>
