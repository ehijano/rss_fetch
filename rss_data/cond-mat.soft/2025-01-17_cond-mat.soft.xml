      <title>Measuring multisubunit mechanics of geometrically-programmed colloidal assemblies via cryo-EM multi-body refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly has recently enabled the creation of complex structures through precise control of the interparticle interactions and the particle geometries. Targeting ever more structurally complex, dynamic, and functional assemblies necessitates going beyond the design of the structure itself, to the measurement and control of the local flexibility of the inter-subunit connections and its impact on the collective mechanics of the entire assembly. In this study, we demonstrate a method to infer the mechanical properties of multisubunit assemblies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and RELION's multi-body refinement. Specifically, we analyze the fluctuations of pairs of DNA-origami subunits that self-assemble into tubules. By measuring the fluctuations of dimers using cryo-EM, we extract mechanical properties such as the bending modulus and interparticle spring constant. These properties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes, which align well with experimental observations. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics, but also opens new pathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior. This methodology could have broader applications in the study of nanomaterials, including protein assemblies, where understanding the interplay of mechanical properties and subunit geometry is essential for controlling complex self-assembled structures.</description>

      <title>At low temperatures, glass-forming liquids relax in a simple way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids have only a modest tendency to crystallize and hence their dynamics can be studied even below the melting temperature. The relaxation dynamics of most of these liquids shows at a temperature $T_c$, somewhat above the glass-transition temperature $T_g$, a crossover, which indicates the conjunction of two different dynamical regimes. For temperatures slightly above $T_c$, experiments and computer simulations have extensively probed this dynamics on the particle level and identified several universal scaling laws that are often compatible with theoretical predictions. Using large scale computer simulations we extend these studies to temperatures below $T_c$ and find that the relaxation mechanism is qualitatively different from the one found at higher temperatures. We identify new scaling laws that allow to give a simple description of the relaxation dynamics at very low $T$s. Specifically we reveal that the cage-escape process is related to rare but large particle displacements that give rise to a distinctive sub-diffusive power-law in the time correlation functions. This insight helps to advance our understanding on the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming systems at temperatures that are close to the experimental glass transition.</description>

      <title>Magnetically induced deformation of isotropic magneto-active elastomers and its relation to the magnetorheological effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can isotropic Magneto-Active Elastomers (MAEs) undergo giant magnetically induced deformations and exhibit huge magnetorheological effects simultaneously? In this experimental and theoretical study, we reveal how the macroscopic deformation of MAEs relates to the process of particle restructuring caused by application of a magnetic field. For this purpose, MAE cylinders with different aspect ratios and particle loadings are studied in uniform magnetic fields. The axial deformations of the cylinders are acquired using an optical camera. A unified mean-field model proposed in previous studies is adapted to describe the transition of initially isotropic cylinders into transversely isotropic ones. This mechanical transition is caused by the rearrangement of particles into dense columnar structures aligned with the field and is believed to result in a huge magnetorheological effect. Our model however predicts less than three-fold increase in elastic moduli when evaluated along the field direction. This prediction is based on a careful examination of the shear moduli of studied MAEs and the columnar structures. A weak magnetorheological effect explains significant axial deformations measured in the field direction. A strong magnetorheological effect would hinder axial deformations due to an increase in modulus by several orders of magnitude. Not only are the moduli and macroscopic deformations influenced by microstructure evolution, but so is the magnetization of particles, which increases as they rearrange into dense columns. With this study, we show that the unified mean-field model provides quantitative access to hidden material properties such as magnetization and stiffness in MAE samples with different shapes and evolving microstructures.</description>

      <title>Very soft microgels at the interface behave and flow as Hertzian-like spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in two dimensions (2D). Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Aging of colloidal gels in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the aging of colloidal gels using light microscopy movies of depletion gels from the International Space Station. Under such microgravity conditions, we observe a slowdown in particle dynamics consistent with gel aging. Stronger attractive forces promote the formation of thicker gel strands over time. The samples are bidisperse, composed of particles with a size ratio 1.2. Larger particles experience stronger depletion forces, which lead to a large first-neighbor peak in the pair correlation function $g(r)$ due to the prevalence of large-large particle contacts. As the gel ages, small mobile particles are incorporated into the gel structure. The changes in gel structure correlate with a slow power-law decay in particle motion, observed over nearly two orders of magnitude of time scales in microgravity experiments. Additionally, through complementary ground-based experiments, we compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images of depletion colloidal gels. While microgravity gel data are limited to 2D projections, ground-based data establish a correspondence between the 2D and 3D $g(r)$ peak heights. Our results provide new insights into how colloidal gels age in the absence of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Active particle in a very thin interfacial droplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single light-driven Janus particle confined in a very thin oil droplet at an air--water interface displays intriguing dynamics. While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet.</description>

      <title>Active contacts create controllable friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is reasonably described by the speed-independent Amonton-Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many situations where the frictional contact points between two surfaces are "active" and may not all be moving at the same relative speed. In this work we study the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts each with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple active contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction forces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent friction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled wheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds and demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active contact speeds. Next we directly measure the ground reaction forces and observe how the contact speeds can control the force-speed curve of the system. In the final experiments we demonstrate how control of the force-speed curve can create sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and controllable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with appropriate force-speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the force-speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems we can better understand animal and robot locomotion, and furthermore open up opportunities for new engineered surfaces to control sliding friction.</description>

      <title>Slowly decaying strain solitons in nonlinear viscoelastic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the modeling of longitudinal strain waves in a rod composed of a nonlinear viscoelastic material characterized by frequency-dependent second- and third-order elastic constants. We demonstrate that long waves in such a material can be effectively described by a damped Boussinesq-type equation for the longitudinal strain, incorporating dissipation through retarded operators. Using the existing theory of solitary wave solutions in nearly integrable systems, we derive a slowly-decaying strain soliton solution to this equation. The derived soliton characteristics are shown to be in a good agreement with results from full 3D simulations. We demonstrate the importance of taking into account the frequency dependence of third-order elastic constants for the description of strain solitons.</description>

      <title>Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Selective and Collective Actuation in Active Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active solids consist of elastically coupled out-of-equilibrium units performing work. They are central to autonomous processes, such as locomotion, self-oscillations and rectification, in biological systems,designer materials and robotics. Yet, the feedback mechanism between elastic and active forces, and the possible emergence of collective behaviours in a mechanically stable elastic solid remains elusive. Here we introduce a minimal realization of an active elastic solid, in which we characterize the emergence of selective and collective actuation and fully map out the interplay between activity, elasticity and geometry. Polar active agents exert forces on the nodes of a two dimensional elastic lattice. The resulting displacement field nonlinearly reorients the active agents. For large enough coupling, a collective oscillation of the lattice nodes around their equilibrium position emerges. Only a few elastic modes are actuated and, crucially, they are not necessarily the lowest energy ones. Combining experiments with the numerical and theoretical analysis of an agents model, we unveil the bifurcation scenario and the selection mechanism by which the collective actuation takes place. Our findings may provide a new mechanism for oscillatory dynamics in biological tissues and specifically confluent cell monolayers. The present selection mechanism may also be advantageous in providing meta-materials, with bona fide autonomy.</description>

      <title>Markov-type state models to describe non-Markovian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When clustering molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories into a few metastable conformational states, the Markov state models (MSMs) assumption of timescale separation between fast intrastate fluctuations and rarely occurring interstate transitions is often not valid. Hence, the naive estimation of the macrostate transition matrix via simply counting transitions between the states leads to significantly too short implied timescales and thus to too fast population decays. In this work, we discuss advanced approaches to estimate the transition matrix. Assuming that Markovianity is at least given at the microstate level, we consider the Laplace-transform based method by Hummer and Szabo, as well as a direct microstate-to-macrostate projection, which by design yields correct macrostate population dynamics. Alternatively, we study the recently proposed quasi-MSM ansatz of Huang and coworkers to solve a generalized master equations, as well as a hybrid method that employs MD at short times and MSM at long times. Adopting a one-dimensional toy model and an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, we discuss the virtues and shortcomings of the various approaches.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.</description>

      <title>Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>
