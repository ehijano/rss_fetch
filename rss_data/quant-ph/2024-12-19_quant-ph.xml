      <title>Resolving the Quantum Measurement Problem through Leveraging the Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schrodinger equation is incomplete, inherently unable to explain the collapse of the wavefunction caused by measurement; a fundamental issue known as the quantum measurement problem. Quantum mechanics is generally constrained by the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite observations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating that in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal equation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation window. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes substantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that only with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in a well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is warped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique solution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions. Our framework bridges seemingly disparate concepts such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, decoherence, and measurement within intrinsic quantum mechanics even without invoking new theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-parametric Nonlinear Generalization of Klein-Gordon: Real and Complex Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a nonlinear multiparametric Klein-Gordon for complex and real fields with mass dimension depending on a real parameter $\alpha$ as $\delta = 2/(1+\alpha)$ where $\delta$ is the mass dimension of the fields. We show that there are three classes of generalized models, one class for complex fields and two different classes for real fields. All models in these three classes have travelling-wave solutions and satisfy the relativistic dispersion relation. Moreover, all models of the complex class and models of only one class of the two real classes recover the standard Klein-Gordon model. We also build the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian for the three classes of models. The fields in the models of these three classes could in principle have the mass dimension varying from zero to one and this can allow us to construct interaction terms, other than $\lambda \Phi^4$, with coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimensions. Furthermore, we also show that there is a subclass of equations in the complex class which has a Lorentzian soliton solution.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Spin Glass Order and its realization in qLDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter have close connections to computation. Two prominent examples are spin glass order, with wide-ranging applications in machine learning and optimization, and topological order, closely related to quantum error correction. Here, we introduce the concept of topological quantum spin glass (TQSG) order which marries these two notions, exhibiting both the complex energy landscapes of spin glasses, and the quantum memory and long-range entanglement characteristic of topologically ordered systems. Using techniques from coding theory and a quantum generalization of Gibbs state decompositions, we show that TQSG order is the low-temperature phase of various quantum LDPC codes on expander graphs, including hypergraph and balanced product codes. Our work introduces a topological analog of spin glasses that preserves quantum information, opening new avenues for both statistical mechanics and quantum computer science.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Driven-Dissipative Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity of non-Hermitian systems has been extensively studied and stimulated ideas about developing new types of sensors. In this paper, we examine a chain of parametrically driven coupled resonators governed by the squeezed Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We emphasize the qualitative difference in sensor performance between configurations depending on bulk topology and boundary modes, specifically for detecting both on-site and non-Hermitian skin effect perturbations. Our analysis goes beyond the scenario of infinitesimal perturbations, extending to arbitrary perturbation strengths beyond the linear response regime. We stress the importance of optimizing the system's parameters to achieve quantum enhancement while avoiding fine-tuned regimes that could limit the practical applicability of this system for real-world quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous discharging of quantum batteries: the ergotropic Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in non equilibrium statistical mechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an initially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This effect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and quantum settings. In this letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba effect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where batteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged states. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic mode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the ergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the battery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's state and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism allows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and allows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We also find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using different operations can discharge at different rates.</description>

      <title>All pure multipartite entangled states of qubits can be self-tested up to complex conjugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing refers to the certification of quantum states and measurements based entirely on the correlations exhibited by measurements on separate subsystems. In the bipartite case, self-testing of states has been completely characterized, up to local isometries, as there exist protocols that self-test arbitrary pure states of any local dimension. Much less is known in the multipartite case, where an important difference with respect to the bipartite case appears: there exist multipartite states that are not equivalent, up to local isometries, to their complex conjugate. Thus, any self-testing characterization must in general be complete up to not only local unitaries, but also complex conjugation. Under these premises, in this work, we give a complete characterization of self-testing in the multipartite qubit case.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process model kernels for noisy optimization in variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) aim at solving classical or quantum optimization problems by optimizing parametrized trial states on a quantum device, based on the outcomes of noisy projective measurements. The associated optimization process benefits from an accurate modeling of the cost function landscape using Gaussian Process Models (GPMs), whose performance is critically affected by the choice of their kernel. Here we introduce trigonometric kernels, inspired by the observation that typical VQA cost functions display oscillatory behaviour with only few frequencies. Appropriate scores to benchmark the reliability of a GPM are defined, and a systematic comparison between different kernels is carried out on prototypical problems from quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization. We further introduce RotoGP, a sequential line-search optimizer equipped with a GPM, and test how different kernels can help mitigate noise and improve optimization convergence. Overall, we observe that the trigonometric kernels show the best performance in most of the cases under study.</description>

      <title>Assessing fault-tolerant quantum advantage for $k$-SAT with structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many problems, quantum algorithms promise speedups over their classical counterparts. However, these results predominantly rely on asymptotic worst-case analysis, which overlooks significant overheads due to error correction and the fact that real-world instances often contain exploitable structure. In this work, we employ the hybrid benchmarking method to evaluate the potential of quantum Backtracking and Grover's algorithm against the 2023 SAT competition main track winner in solving random $k$-SAT instances with tunable structure, designed to represent industry-like scenarios, using both $T$-depth and $T$-count as cost metrics to estimate quantum run times. Our findings reproduce the results of Campbell, Khurana, and Montanaro (Quantum '19) in the unstructured case using hybrid benchmarking. However, we offer a more sobering perspective in practically relevant regimes: almost all quantum speedups vanish, even asymptotically, when minimal structure is introduced or when $T$-count is considered instead of $T$-depth. Moreover, when the requirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we find that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical algorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth. We also discuss how more sophisticated heuristics could restore the asymptotic scaling advantage for quantum backtracking, but our findings suggest that the potential for practical quantum speedups in more structured $k$-SAT solving will remain limited.</description>

      <title>Simulating imperfect quantum optical circuits using unsymmetrized bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing requires the generation of large entangled resource states. The required size of these states makes it challenging to simulate the effects of errors such as loss and partial distinguishability. For an interferometer with $N$ partially distinguishable input photons and $M$ spatial modes, the Fock basis can have up to ${N+NM-1\choose N}$ elements. We show that it is possible to use a much smaller unsymmetrized basis with size $M^N$ without discarding any information. This enables simulations of the joint effect of loss and partial distinguishability on larger states than is otherwise possible. We demonstrate the technique by providing the first-ever simulations of the generation of imperfect qubits encoded using quantum parity codes, including an example where the Hilbert space is over $60$ orders of magnitude smaller than the $N$-photon Fock space. As part of the analysis, we derive the loss mechanism for partially distinguishable photons.</description>

      <title>WaveguideQED.jl: An Efficient Framework for Simulating Non-Markovian Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a numerical framework designed to solve problems within the emerging field of Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (WQED). The framework is based on collision quantum optics, where a localized quantum system interacts sequentially with individual time-bin modes. This approach provides a physically intuitive model that allows researchers familiar with tools such as QuTiP in Python, Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab, or QuantumOptics.jl in Julia to efficiently set up and execute WQED simulations. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we demonstrate the framework's robust ability to handle complex WQED scenarios. These applications include the scattering of single- or two-photon pulses by quantum emitters or cavities, as well as the exploration of non-Markovian dynamics, where emitted photons are reflected back, thereby introducing feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Experimental noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states of light by two-photon addition and subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noiseless quantum amplifiers are probabilistic quantum devices that enhance amplitude of coherent states without adding any noise, which has far reaching applications in quantum optics and quantum information processing. Here, we report on experimental implementation of an advanced noiseless quantum amplifier for coherent states of light that is based on conditional addition of two photons followed by conditional subtraction of two photons. We comprehensively characterize the noiselessly amplified coherent states via quantum state tomography and analyze the amplification gain and noise properties of the amplifier. We observe very good agreement between the experiment and theoretical predictions. Our work reveals that sequences of multiple photon additions and subtractions represent an efficient and experimentally feasible alternative to multiplexing that was originally proposed to boost the performance of noiseless quantum amplifiers. Beyond noiseless quantum amplification, our experiment represents a significant step forward towards engineering complex quantum operations on traveling light beams by coherent combinations of various sequences of multiphoton additions and subtractions.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single organic molecules embedded in solid-state matrices exhibit remarkable optical properties, making them competitive candidates for single-photon sources and quantum nonlinear optical elements. However, the lack of long-lived internal states imposes significant constraints on their application in the broader field of quantum technologies. In this article, we reexamine the single-molecule host-guest system from first principles, elaborate on the rich internal states this system encompasses and put forward strategies to harness them for applications in quantum memory, spin-photon interface, spin register, and optomechanics. Further, we discuss the potential of leveraging the vast chemical space of molecules, and highlight the challenges and opportunities for molecular systems along these directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing reliable quantum links between a network of satellites and ground stations is a crucial step towards realizing a wide range of satellite-based quantum protocols, including global quantum networks, distributed sensing, quantum key distribution, and quantum clock synchronization. In this article, we envision a network of satellites and ground stations where quantum links are created through the exchange of entangled photon pairs. We simulate the dynamics of a satellite constellation and a set of Bell tests between the constellation and ground stations. We identify the regions on Earth where Bell tests can be successfully conducted with a satellite or a set of them, at a specified level of confidence. These regions move with the constellation and will be referred to as "Bell violation shadows". We demonstrate that these shadows provide valuable insights for the study and evaluation of many satellite-mediated or satellite-assisted quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Characterizing quantum state-space with a single quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the state-space of $d$-dimensional quantum theory be derived from studying the behavior of a single measuring device? The answer is yes, if the measuring device corresponds to a complex-projective 3-design. Through its Jordan algebraic structure, quantum state-space is fully determined by its third moment, allowing one to characterize the states of the theory by their probabilities with respect to a 3-design measurement. QBism proposes that quantum theory is normative guidance for an agent's gambles in a world without hidden variables and re-interprets the quantum formalism as a set of consistency conditions on an agent's probability assignments across different experiments. Thus consistency with a single 3-design "reference device," properly interpreted, implies consistency with all of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Quantum Correlations in a Clean-Disordered Atom-Nanophotonic Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are essential to the emergent behaviors of quantum systems, supporting key phenomena such as localization or delocalization of particles, quantum avalanches in many-body localized systems, and quantum information transfer. In open atom-nanophotonic systems characterized by long-range spin-exchange interactions, we examine the influence of clean system size on high-order quantum correlations among a clean-disordered atomic array with multiple atomic excitations. By initializing the system far from equilibrium, we observe a suppression of quantum correlations for localized atomic excitations in the disordered zone as the clean system size increases, showcasing the delocalization behavior in the high-order spin-exchange processes. The calculation of the entanglement entropy at the interface further substantiates this thermalizing effect. Our results manifest distinct quantum correlations enabled by long-range interactions mediated by the waveguide, enhance the theoretical comprehension of clean-disordered systems, and provide insights to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in an atom-nanophotonic platform.</description>

      <title>Momentum space magic for the transverse field quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer entropies and quantum magic have been extensively explored in real-space formulations of quantum systems within the framework of resource theory. However, interesting and transparent physics often emerges in momentum space, such as Cooper pairing. Motivated by this, we investigate the momentum-space structure of Pauli strings and stabilizer entropies in the one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model. By mapping the Ising chain onto momentum-space qubits, where the stabilizer state corresponds to the paramagnetic state, we analyze the evolution of the Pauli string distribution. In the ferromagnetic phase, the distribution is broad, whereas in the paramagnetic phase, it develops a two-peaked structure. We demonstrate that all ferromagnetic states possess the same degree of magic in the thermodynamic limit, while stabilizer entropies are non-analytic at the critical point and vanish with increasing transverse field. The momentum-space approach to quantum magic not only complements its real-space counterpart but also provides advantages in terms of analyzing nonstabilizerness and classical simulability.</description>

      <title>Projective purification of correlated reduced density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for accurate approximate solutions of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation, reduced density matrices play an important role, as they allow to formulate approximate methods with polynomial scaling in the number of particles. However, these methods frequently encounter the issue of $N$-representability, whereby in self-consistent applications of the methods, the reduced density matrices become unphysical. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the past to restore a given set of $N$-representability conditions once the reduced density matrices become defective. However, these purification algorithms have either ignored symmetries of the Hamiltonian related to conserved quantities, or have not incorporated them in an efficient way, thereby modifying the reduced density matrix to a greater extent than is necessary. In this paper, we present an algorithm capable of efficiently performing all of the following tasks in the least invasive manner: restoring a given set of $N$-representability conditions, maintaining contraction consistency between successive orders of reduced density matrices, and preserving all conserved quantities. We demonstrate the superiority of the present purification algorithm over previous ones in the context of the time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix method applied to the quench dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>A Generic Method for Integrating Lindblad Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. While mathematically equivalent to the widely-used vectorization method, our method offers significant improvements in the numerical efficiency, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically study the exceptional points of a Liouvillian super-operator describing an open quantum system of two interacting qubits with a dissipative bath of polarization applied to one of the qubits. Our focus is the structure of the exceptional point manifolds in the parameter space which we describe in all analytic details. In particular, we characterize the manifold of bifurcation points corresponding to largest dissipation, and describe the relative effective quantum Zeno dynamics in the bifurcation-free regime, which may occur at relatively small dissipation.</description>

      <title>A hybrid learning agent for episodic learning tasks with unknown target distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "hybrid agent for quantum-accessible reinforcement learning", as defined in (Hamann and W\"olk, 2022), provides a proven quasi-quadratic speedup and is experimentally tested. However, the standard version can only be applied to episodic learning tasks with fixed episode length. In many real-world applications, the information about the necessary number of steps within an episode to reach a defined target is not available in advance and especially before reaching the target for the first time. Furthermore, in such scenarios, classical agents have the advantage of observing at which step they reach the target. Whether the hybrid agent can provide an advantage in such learning scenarios was unknown so far. In this work, we introduce a hybrid agent with a stochastic episode length selection strategy to alleviate the need for knowledge about the necessary episode length. Through simulations, we test the adapted hybrid agent's performance versus classical counterparts. We find that the hybrid agent learns faster than corresponding classical learning agents in certain scenarios with unknown target distance and without fixed episode length.</description>

      <title>Two-qubit gate protocols with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states constitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing. Elementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently fast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole interactions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated in a breakthrough experiment $[\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2152-9}{1}]$. We theoretically investigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate operations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear Paul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the essential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization scheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning and Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol. We show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving relative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect the fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of Rydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate protocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as $99.25\,\%$ for a gate time of $0.2\,\mu\mathrm{s}$. This considerably undercuts entangling gate durations between ground-state ions, for which gate times are typically limited by the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places trapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing and eventually quantum error correction become possible.</description>

      <title>Turning qubit noise into a blessing: Automatic state preparation and long-time dynamics for impurity models on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Qubit Readout of Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light can exponentially increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of dispersive qubit readout, especially using a combination of injected external squeezing (IES) and intracavity squeezing (ICS). We further investigate whether IES and ICS can also exponentially improve the measurement precision of temperature. In the case of fully thermalized qubits isolated from thermal bath, the measurement precision of temperature can be improved exponentially when the temperature or measurement time or the input photon number approaches 0. In general, thermal fluctuations prevent the action of squeezed light. When multiple qubits maintain interacting with the thermal bath, the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved if the loss rate of the cavity is large and the coupling between the qubit and the optical cavity is weak enough. In the meantime, IES can also further promote the improvement of the measurement precision of the temperature exponentially.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network decoders for process tensor descriptions of non-Markovian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Often in QEC errors are assumed to be independent and identically distributed and can be discretised to a random Pauli error during the execution of a quantum circuit. In real devices, however, the noise profile is much more complex and contains non-trivial spatiotemporal correlations, such as cross-talk, non-Markovianity, and their mixtures. Here, we examine the performance of two paradigmatic QEC codes in the presence of complex noise by using process tensors to represent spatiotemporal correlations beyond iid errors. This integration is an instance of the recently proposed \textit{strategic code}, which combines QEC with process tensors. In particular, we construct the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder for a quantum error correction code with a process tensor. To understand the computational overhead and implications of this approach, we implement our framework numerically for small code instances and evaluate its performance. We also propose a method to evaluate the performance of strategic codes and construct the ML decoder with an efficient tensor network approximation. Our results highlight the possible detrimental effects of correlated noise and potential pathways for designing decoders that account for such effects.</description>

      <title>Accurate and precise optical phase sensor based on a non-linear quantum Sagnac interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical phase measurements play a key role in the detection of macroscopic parameters such as position, velocity, and displacement. They also permit to qualify the microscopic properties of photonic waveguides such as polarization mode dispersion, refractive index difference, and chromatic dispersion. In the quest for ever-better measurement performance and relevance, we report an original quantum non-linear interferometer based on a Sagnac configuration allowing precise, accurate, self-stabilized, and reproductible optical phase measurement. The potential of this system is demonstrated through the measurement of second-order dispersion, namely chromatic dispersion, of a commercial dispersion-shifted fiber at telecommunication wavelength. We assess precision by exhibiting a statistical error of $7.10^{-3}\, \%$, showing more that one order of magnitude compares to state-of-the-art measurements. Additionally, the accuracy of the second-order dispersion value is determined through the measurement of the third-order dispersion, showing a quadratic error as low as 5\,\%. Our system promises the development of photonic-based sensors enabling the measurements of optical-material properties in a user-friendly manner.</description>

      <title>QuLTSF: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) involves predicting a large number of future values of a time series based on the past values and is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis, disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix and entanglement Hamiltonian for a free real scalar field on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact result for the reduced density matrix on a finite interval for a $1+1$ dimensional free real scalar field in the ground state is presented. In the massless case, the Williamson decomposition of the appearing kernels is explicitly performed, which allows to reproduce the known result for the entanglement (modular) Hamiltonian and, for a small mass $M$ of the field, find the leading $\sim1/\ln M$ non-local corrections. In the opposite $M\to\infty$ case, it is argued that, up to terms $O(M^{-1/2})$, the entanglement Hamiltonian is local with the density being the Hamiltonian density spatially modulated by a triangular-shape function.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Structured Bosonic Environments at Finite Temperature by Interpolative Decomposition: Theory and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theory for a novel method to discretize the spectral density of a bosonic heat bath, as introduced in [H. Takahashi and R. Borrelli, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{161}, 151101 (2024)]. The approach leverages a low-rank decomposition of the Fourier-transform relation connecting the bath correlation function to its spectral density. By capturing the time, frequency, and temperature dependencies encoded in the spectral density-autocorrelation function relation, our method significantly reduces the degrees of freedom required for simulating open quantum system dynamics. We benchmark our approach against existing methods and demonstrate its efficacy through applications to both simple models and a realistic electron transfer process in biological systems. Additionally, we show that this new approach can be effectively combined with the tensor-train formalism to investigate the quantum dynamics of systems interacting with complex non-Markovian environments. Finally, we provide a perspective on the selection and application of various spectral density discretization techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize various fields, yet the execution of quantum programs necessitates an effective compilation process. This involves strategically mapping quantum circuits onto the physical qubits of a quantum processor. The qubits' arrangement, or topology, is pivotal to the circuit's performance, a factor that often defies traditional heuristic or manual optimization methods due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce a novel approach leveraging reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor qubit topologies to the unique specifications of individual quantum circuits, guiding algorithm-driven quantum processor topology design for reducing the depth of mapped circuit, which is particularly critical for the output accuracy on noisy quantum processors. Our method marks a significant departure from previous methods that have been constrained to mapping circuits onto a fixed processor topology. Experiments demonstrate that we have achieved notable enhancements in circuit performance, with a minimum of 20\% reduction in circuit depth in 60\% of the cases examined, and a maximum enhancement of up to 46\%. Furthermore, the pronounced benefits of our approach in reducing circuit depth become increasingly evident as the scale of the quantum circuits increases, exhibiting the scalability of our method in terms of problem size. This work advances the co-design of quantum processor architecture and algorithm mapping, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in the field.</description>

      <title>Singular transport in non-equilibrium strongly internal-coupled 1D tilted field spin-1/2 chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium spin-chain systems have been attracting increasing interest in energy transport. This work studies a one-dimensional non-equilibrium Ising chain immersed in a tilted magnetic field, every spin contacts a Boson reservoir with the dissipative system-environment interaction. We analytically investigate the dynamics and the steady-state energy transport taking advantage of the Born-Markov-secular master equation. In the longitudinal field, one can find that the non dissipative $N^\prime$ spins decompose the spin chain into $N^\prime +1$ independent subchains and block the heat currents from the hot end to the cool end. Moreover, for the non-dissipative $\mu$th spin, its nearest two bulk spins become the nodal spins in the subchains and have the corresponding energy correction of $\pm J_{\mu-1,\mu}$ and $\pm J_{\mu,\mu+1}$ depending on the excited/ground state of the $\mu$th spin. Therefore, a magnetically controlled heat modulator can be designed by adjusting the direction of the magnetic field in which the non-dissipative spin is located. For the transverse field case, the whole Hilbert space of the chain can always be divided into two independent subspaces regardless of whether the bulk spin is dissipative. This work provides new insight into the dynamics and energy transport of the dissipative Ising model.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device-independent entanglement witness with imprecise input states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent entanglement witnesses (MDI-EWs) enable the detection of entanglement without relying on characterized measurements. However, the entanglement criteria for MDI-EWs typically assume the idealized condition that the lab input states are precisely the desired ones. In this work, we remove this idealization by considering the realistic scenario in which lab input states may be imprecise. We introduce a new class of MDI-EWs, termed sensitive MDI-EWs, whose entanglement criteria fail under any non-zero imprecision in the input states. We derive sufficient conditions for an MDI-EW to be classified as sensitive, revealing that a large class of MDI-EWs exhibit this sensitivity. Additionally, we demonstrate that two well-known MDI-EWs for Werner states are sensitive according to our criteria, one of which recovers the result from a previous study [Phys. Rev. A 104, 012429 (2021)]. Moreover, we clarify the concept of lab input states in a way that makes imprecisions experimentally measurable, and propose a systematic approach for modifying the criterion of any MDI-EW to accommodate small imprecisions, thus enhancing experimental relevance. A simple MDI-EW example is provided, where our modified criterion is already optimal. This work bridges the gap between idealized theoretical models and practical experimental conditions, paving the way for more robust and accessible entanglement detection in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace where we diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>99.9%-fidelity in measuring a superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant progress in superconducting quantum computation over the past years, quantum state measurement still lags nearly an order of magnitude behind quantum gate operations in speed and fidelity. The main challenge is that the strong coupling and readout signal used to probe the quantum state may also introduce additional channels which may cause qubit state transitions. Here, we design a novel architecture to implement the long-sought longitudinal interaction scheme between qubits and resonators. This architecture not only provides genuine longitudinal interaction by eliminating residual transversal couplings, but also introduces proper nonlinearity to the resonator that can further minimize decay error and measurement-induced excitation error. Our experimental results demonstrate a measurement fidelity of 99.8% in 202 ns without the need for any first-stage amplification. After subtracting the residual preparation errors, the pure measurement fidelity is above 99.9%. Our scheme is compatible with the multiplexing readout scheme and can be used for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Models for Time-series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a valuable tool for many applications, such as stock price predictions, demand forecasting or logistical optimization. There are many well-established statistical and machine learning models that are used for this purpose. Recently in the field of quantum machine learning many candidate models for forecasting have been proposed, however in the absence of theoretical grounds for advantage thorough benchmarking is essential for scientific evaluation.
  To this end, we performed a benchmarking study using real data of various quantum models, both gate-based and annealing-based, comparing them to the state-of-the-art classical approaches, including extensive hyperparameter optimization. Overall we found that the best classical models outperformed the best quantum models. Most of the quantum models were able to achieve comparable results and for one data set two quantum models outperformed the classical ARIMA model. These results serve as a useful point of comparison for the field of forecasting with quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Lindblad dynamics of open multi-mode bosonic systems: Algebra of bilinear superoperators, spectral problem, exceptional points and speed of evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the algebraic method based on the Lie algebra of quadratic combinations of left and right superoperators associated with matrices to study the Lindblad dynamics of multimode bosonic systems coupled a thermal bath and described by the Liouvillian superoperator that takes into account both dynamical (coherent) and environment mediated (incoherent) interactions between the modes. Our algebraic technique is applied to transform the Liouvillian into the diagonalized form by eliminating jump superoperators and solve the spectral problem. The temperature independent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}_{eff}$, is found to govern both the diagonalized Liouvillian and the spectral properties. It is shown that the Liouvillian exceptional points are represented by the points in the parameter space where the matrix, $H$, associated with $\hat{H}_{eff}$ is non-diagonalizable. We use our method to derive the low-temperature approximation for the superpropagator and to study the special case of a two mode system representing the photonic polarization modes. For this system, we describe the geometry of exceptional points in the space of frequency and relaxation vectors parameterizing the intermode couplings and, for a single-photon state, evaluate the time dependence of the speed of evolution as a function of the angles characterizing the couplings and the initial state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference between two independent photons stands as a crucial aspect of numerous quantum information protocols and technologies. In this work, we leverage fiber-coupled devices, which encompass fibered photon pair-sources and off-the-shelf optics, to demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We employ two distinct single photon sources, namely an heralded single-photon source and a weak coherent laser source, both operating asynchronously in continuous-wave regime. We record two-photon coincidences, showing a state-of-art visibility of 91.9(5)\%. This work, compliant with telecom technology provides realistic backbones for establishing long-range communication based on quantum teleportation in hybrid quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Transformation Matrices: A Block Decomposition Approach for Efficient Gate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm designed to approximate quantum transformation matrix with a restricted number of gates by using the block decomposition technique. Addressing challenges posed by numerous gates in handling large qubit transformations, the algorithm provides a solution by optimizing gate usage while maintaining computational accuracy. Inspired by the Block Decompose algorithm, our approach processes transformation matrices in a block-wise manner, enabling users to specify the desired gate count for flexibility in resource allocation. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in approximating transformations with significantly fewer gates, enhancing quantum computing efficiency for complex calculations. This work contributes a practical tool for efficient quantum computation, bridging the gap for scalable and effective quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply covariant affine integral quantization to study motion in the 2D punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), representing transformations of the plane composed of translations, rotations, and dilations. Near the punctured point, we observe that the topology influencing quantum fluctuations gives rise to an affine vector potential, which can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge potential generated by an infinite coil. This finding suggests that the AB effect originates from the topology enforced by the impenetrable coil, rather than from a classical gauge potential. Our results offer a novel perspective on the AB effect, emphasizing the fundamental role of topology in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The random coupled-plaquette gauge model and the surface code under circuit-level noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the decoding problem of the surface code under depolarizing and syndrome noise to a disordered spin model, which we call the random coupled-plaquette gauge model (RCPGM). By coupling X- and Z-syndrome volumes, this model allows us to optimally account for genuine Y-errors in the surface code in a setting with noisy measurements. Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for the phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\%$ under uniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement compared to results obtained via the previously known "uncoupled" random plaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing Y-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level noise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric depolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite this reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the intricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for the phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\%$, to be compared to $0.7\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the Y-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the landscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In particular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that accounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code decoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder development, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen recent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is further room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain time-resolved spectra of spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence of a single multilevel emitter where two antiparallel transitions interfere and cause quantum beats. After rising as a single broad peak, the spontaneous emission spectrum turns into a doublet of subnatural peaks and then fades for long times. For strong field resonance fluorescence, the beat signature is the formation of doublet sidebands, which initially grow asymmetrically but end up symmetrical. We stress the filter bandwidth's crucial role in the spectral resolution and causal evolution.</description>

      <title>Oscillators with imaginary coupling: spectral functions in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axioms of Quantum Mechanics require that the hamiltonian of any closed system is self-adjoint, so that energy levels are real and time evolution preserves probability. On the other hand, non-hermitian hamiltonians with ${\cal{PT}}$-symmetry can have both real spectra and unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study in detail a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an imaginary bilinear term, both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory. We discuss explicitly how such hamiltonians lead to perfectly sound physical theories with real spectra and unitary time evolution, in spite of their non-hermiticity. We also analyze two-point correlation functions and their associated K\"allen-Lehmann representation. In particular, we discuss the intimate relation between positivity violation of the spectral functions and the non-observability of operators in a given correlation function. Finally, we conjecture that positivity violation of some spectral functions of the theory could be a generic sign of the existence of complex pairs of energy eigenvalues (i.e., a ${\cal{PT}}$-broken phase) somewhere in its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</description>

Abstract: Achieving strong coherent interaction between qubits separated by large distances holds the key to many important developments in quantum technology, including new designs of quantum computers, new platforms for quantum simulations and implementation of large scale quantum optical networks. However, the inherent mismatch between the spatial dimensions of a quantum emitter and the photon wavelength fundamentally limits the transmission of quantum entanglement over long distances. Here we demonstrate, that long-range qubit entanglement can be readily achieved when qubit interactions are mediated by optical polariton waves in a hyperbolic material, due to the phenomenon of the Hyperbolic Super-Resonance. We show that in this regime the resulting quantum gate fidelity that exceeds 99%, can be achieved with the use of qubits based on well known deep donors in silicon when their interactions are mediated by polariton fields in the substrate formed by a hyperbolic material (such as e.g. hexagonal boron nitride. At the physical level the proposed system is essentially a silicon-based optoelectronic chip, and it's readily accessible to the existing methods of semiconductor nanofabrication, leading to the integration densities of well over 10^8. qubits/cm^2, and therefore opening the way to scalable and fault-tolerant error correction in quantum computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, due to the optical time scales that define the duration of the gate operation in the proposed system, and sub-nanosecond time of the decoherence in deep donors in silicon at the liquid nitrogen temperatures, the proposed Hyperbolic Quantum Processor does not require dilution refrigeration and therefore offers a pathway to bring quantum computation to the realm of conventional engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality mechanical resonators are critical for driving advances in quantum information technologies, precision sensing, and optomechanics. However, achieving compact resonator designs that maintain high performance is a key challenge. In this study, we present a new class of compact resonators optimized to operate at higher-order eigenmodes, achieving both high frequencies and enhanced quality factor-frequency (Qf) products. By employing topology optimization to maximize the damping dilution factor, these resonators achieve minimized edge bending losses and enhanced intrinsic damping. Their high-(Qf) performance and compact form factor position these resonators as promising candidates for applications in quantum information transduction, advanced optomechanical systems, and next-generation sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Synchronization in a driven qubit system coupled to a structured environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the issue of Quantum Synchronization in a driven two-level (qubit) system situated within a structured environment. Our findings have practical implications as we discover that adding a time-dependent periodic modulation to the transition frequency of the qubit can significantly enhance quantum synchronization. We first discovered the phase preference and, consequently, the phase locking conditions in our system using the Husimi Q-function. It is revealed that combining frequency modulation and non-Markovian effects enables us to achieve a stable phase-locking for the system. We show that tuning the amplitude-tofrequency ratio of the modulation process on the zeros of the zeroth-order Bessel function led to phase locking and, thus, surprisingly enhances quantum synchronization in the system. These results provide new insights into efficiently understanding phase dynamics in quantum environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum effects of mechanical motion, such as backaction evading measurements or squeezing, requires preparation of the oscillator in a high-purity state. The largest state purities in optomechanics to date have relied on cryogenic cooling, combined with coupling to electromagnetic resonators driven with a coherent radiation field. In this work, we cool the mega-hertz-frequency librational mode of an optically levitated silica nanoparticle from room temperature to its quantum ground state. Cooling is realized by coherent scattering into a Fabry-Perot cavity. We use sideband thermometry to infer a phonon population of 0.04 quanta under optimal conditions, corresponding to a state purity of 92%. The purity reached by our room-temperature experiment exceeds the performance offered by mechanically clamped oscillators in a cryogenic environment. Our work establishes a platform for high-purity quantum optomechanics at room temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a sea creature, we identify a robust chiral optical force that pushes the opposite enantiomers of a chiral molecule towards regions of orthogonal linear polarization in an optical field via electric dipole interactions. Our chiral optical force can be orders of magnitude stronger than others proposed to date and applies to essentially all chiral molecules, including isotopically chiral varieties which are notoriously difficult to separate using existing methods. We propose a realistic experiment supported by full numerical simulations, potentially enabling optical separation of opposite enantiomers for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of artificial neural networks that are implemented in a physical system. A major challenge in this context is that these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a change of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer program. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs high-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely used in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of reservoir computing. Moreover, I present some important physical implementations coming from electronics, photonics, spintronics, mechanics, and biology. Finally, I provide a brief discussion of quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials: exploring graphene and fractal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ the transfer matrix method to investigate relativistic particles in super-periodic potentials (SPPs) of arbitrary order $n \in I^{+}$. We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities for spinless Klein particles encountering rectangular potential barriers with super-periodic repetition. It is found that spinless relativistic particles exhibit Klein tunneling and a significantly higher degree of reflection compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. Additionally, we analytically explore the behavior of experimentally realizable massless Dirac electrons as they encounter rectangular potential barriers with a super-periodic pattern in a monolayer of graphene. In this system, the transmission probability, conductance, and Fano factor are evaluated as functions of the number of barriers, the order of super-periodicity, and the angle of incidence. Our findings reveal that the transmission probability shows a series of resonances that depend on the number of barriers and the order of super-periodicity. We extend our analysis to specific cases within the Unified Cantor Potentials (UCPs)-$\gamma$ system ($\gamma$ is a scaling parameter greater than $1$), focusing on the General Cantor fractal system and the General Smith-Volterra-Cantor (GSVC) system. For the General Cantor fractal system, we calculate the tunneling probability, which reveals sharp transmission peaks and progressively thinner unit cell potentials as $G$ increases. In the GSVC system, we analyze the potential segment length and tunneling probability, observing nearly unity tunneling coefficients when $\gamma \approx 1$, as well as saturation behavior in transmission coefficients at higher stages $G$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Exploring such uncertainty relations in pre- and postselected (PPS) systems, where weak measurements on post-selected states have been used as a powerful tool for exploring the foundation of quantum mechanics, has so far eluded experimental effort. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Robertson-Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for two incompatible observables in a PPS system. Through conducting a von Neumann-type measurement, uncertainty relations between two non-commuting Pauli observables are experimentally unveiled. Such uncertainty relations in the PPS system impose limitations on the joint sharp preparation of pre- and postselected states for two incompatible observables. Our experiments would be useful for the development of amplification techniques for precision measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is challenging to scale Ising machines for industrial-level problems due to algorithm or hardware limitations. Although higher-order Ising models provide a more compact encoding, they are, however, hard to physically implement. This work proposes a theoretical framework of a higher-order Ising simulator, IsingSim. The Ising spins and gradients in IsingSim are decoupled and self-customizable. We significantly accelerate the simulation speed via a bidirectional approach for differentiating the hyperedge functions. Our proof-of-concept implementation verifies the theoretical framework by simulating the Ising spins with exact and approximate gradients. Experiment results show that our novel framework can be a useful tool for providing design guidelines for higher-order Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Log-based Anomaly Detection: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is the main component of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), which can detect anomalous that occur during the system on-the-fly. Existing methods commonly extract log sequence features using classical machine learning techniques to identify whether a new sequence is an anomaly or not. However, these classical approaches often require trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. The advent of quantum machine learning (QML) offers a promising alternative. By transforming parts of classical machine learning computations into parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), QML can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy comparable to classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, \ourframework{}, for evaluating QML models in the context of LogAD. This framework incorporates diverse log data, integrated QML models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art methods such as DeepLog, LogAnomaly, and LogRobust, along with their quantum-transformed counterparts, are included in our framework.Beyond standard metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall, our evaluation extends to factors critical to QML performance, such as specificity, the number of circuits, circuit design, and quantum state encoding. Using \ourframework{}, we conduct extensive experiments to assess the performance of these models and their quantum counterparts, uncovering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in QML model selection and design for LogAD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum processors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In semiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multi-spin qubit encodings, such as the exchange-only qubit, where high-fidelity readout and both single- and two-qubit operations have been demonstrated. However, their performance is limited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the computational subspace. In this work, we introduce an alternative, scalable spin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole nanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating leakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is intrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates with two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and mitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture is fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization, readout, and multi-qubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By addressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and scalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry imposed. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

Abstract: Frequency multiplication involves generating harmonics from an input frequency, a technique particularly useful for integrating spin-wave devices operating at different frequencies. While topological magnetic textures offer distinct advantages in spin-wave applications, frequency multiplication has not yet been observed in these structures. Here, we study the magnetization dynamics of magnetic vortices formed in micron-sized disks and squares via wide-field magnetic imaging. We found the occurrence of coherent spin-wave harmonics arising from the gyration of vortex cores driven by microwave fields. This phenomenon reveals a universal mechanism where the periodical motion of delta function-like objects such as vortex cores gives rise to a frequency comb. Our results pave the way for creating nanoscale, tunable spin-based frequency multipliers and open new possibilities for frequency comb generation in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Fool's gold: ligand-receptor interactions and the origins of life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origins of life is a question that continues to intrigue scientists across disciplines. One theory - the iron-sulphur theory - suggests that reactions essential to the synthesis of biological materials got their catalytic 'spark' from mineral surfaces such as iron pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold. Additionally, the binding affinity of the ligands synthesised in this 'surface metabolism' acted as an early version of natural selection: more strongly-binding ligands were accumulated into further autocatalytic reactions and the aggregation of complex biological materials. Ligand-receptor binding is thus fundamental to the origins of life. In this paper, we use the iron-sulphur theory as a lens through which to review ligand-receptor interactions as they are more commonly understood today. In particular we focus on the electron tunnelling theory of receptor activation that has emerged from research into quantum biology. We revisit criticism against this theory, particularly the lack of evidence for electron transfer in receptors, to see what insights might be offered by ligand-receptor interactions mediated by iron pyrite at the origins of life. What emerges from this comparison is the central importance of redox activity in receptors, in particular with respect to the recurring presence of the disulphide bond. While the paper is a speculative exercise, we conclude that conductivity in biomolecules, particularly the selective conductivity conferred by appropriate ligand-receptor binding, is a powerful tool for understanding diverse phenomena such as pharmacological potency and viral infection. As such it deserves further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates are a flexible experimental platform to engineer synthetic quantum many-body systems. In particular, they host the so-called stripe phase, an instance of a supersolid state of matter. The peculiar excitation spectrum of the stripe phase, a definite footprint of its supersolidity, has so far remained out of experimental reach. We achieve in situ imaging of the stripes and directly observe both superfluid and crystal excitations. We investigate superfluid hydrodynamics and reveal a stripe compression mode, thus demonstrating that the system possesses a compressible crystalline structure. Through the frequency softening of this mode, we locate the supersolid transition point. Our results establish spin-orbit-coupled supersolids as a platform of choice to investigate supersolidity and its rich dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider spin chain models with local Hamiltonians that display weak ergodicity breaking. In these models, the majority of the eigenstates are thermal, but there is a distinguished subspace of the Hilbert space in which ergodicity is broken. We achieve such a weak breaking by embedding selected integrable models into larger Hilbert spaces of otherwise chaotic models. The integrable subspaces do not have a tensor product structure with respect to any spatial bipartition, therefore our constructions differ from certain trivial embeddings. We consider multiple mechanisms for such an embedding, and we also review previous examples in the literature. Curiously, all our examples can be seen as perturbations of models with Hilbert space fragmentation, such that the perturbed models are not fragmented anymore.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Screening of Local Spin Moments at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable interest in the context of spintronics device development due to their amenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The latter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the inevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we have systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in phthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive density functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show that the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together result in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin moments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that screening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our results highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted molecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or experimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent characteristic sampling time-scales.</description>

      <title>Modulating Low-Power Threshold Optical Bistability by Electrically Reconfigurable Free-Electron Kerr Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a microscopic mechanism to electrically reconfigure the Kerr nonlinearity by modulating the concentration of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors under a static bias. Our theory incorporates electrostatic and hydrodynamic frameworks to describe the electronic dynamics, demonstrating electrically tunable linear and nonlinear modulations. The power threshold of achieving optical bistability shows unprecedented tunability over two orders of magnitude, reaching values as low as 10 $\mu$W through surface charge control. These findings offer new insights into understanding and actively controlling Kerr nonlinearities, paving the way for efficient refractive index engineering as well as the development of advanced linear and nonlinear electro-optical modulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential probability of the process of Compton ionization of a hydrogen atom by a cylindrical electromagnetic wave is calculated taking into account the finite size of the target, which resulted in the appearance of a dependence of this value on the angular momentum of the cylindrical wave. It is shown that the use of a cylindrical wave instead of a plane wave does not lead to new angular distributions of the reaction products.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncloneable encryption, first introduced by Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) is a quantum encryption scheme in which a quantum ciphertext cannot be distributed between two non-communicating parties such that, given access to the decryption key, both parties cannot learn the underlying plaintext. In this work, we introduce a variant of uncloneable encryption in which several possible decryption keys can decrypt a particular encryption, and the security requirement is that two parties who receive independently generated decryption keys cannot both learn the underlying ciphertext. We show that this variant of uncloneable encryption can be achieved device-independently, i.e., without trusting the quantum states and measurements used in the scheme, and that this variant works just as well as the original definition in constructing quantum money. Moreover, we show that a simple modification of our scheme yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme, which was a related notion introduced by Georgiou and Zhandry. In particular, the resulting single-decryptor encryption scheme achieves device-independent security with respect to a standard definition of security against random plaintexts. Finally, we derive an "extractor" result for a two-adversary scenario, which in particular yields a single-decryptor encryption scheme for single bit-messages that achieves perfect anti-piracy security without needing the quantum random oracle model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies such as quantum computing or high performance detectors. Yet, one of their main limitations regarding to noise and sensitivity is the interaction with two-level systems present in oxide layers in the device. Focused on mitigating this problem, we study a superconducting device combining a 100 nm niobium (Nb) circuit with a 10 nm gold (Au) capping layer. Our investigation covers a wide range of temperatures and driving powers, revealing that adding the Au layer reduces the density of two-level system defects while maintaining a very high quality factor. Moreover, an increase in the non-linearity response is also observed. Our findings suggest the potential of Nb/Au lumped element resonators as versatile and promising tools for advancing superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiplexed operations and extended coherent control over multiple trapping sites are fundamental requirements for a trapped-ion processor in a large scale architecture. Here we demonstrate these building blocks using a surface-electrode trap with integrated photonic components which are scalable to larger numbers of zones. We implement a Ramsey sequence using the integrated light in two zones, separated by 375 $\mu$m, performing transport of the ion from one zone to the other in 200 $\mu$s between pulses. In order to achieve low motional excitation during transport, we developed techniques to measure and mitigate the effect of the exposed dielectric surfaces used to deliver the integrated light to the ion. We also demonstrate simultaneous control of two ions in separate zones with low optical crosstalk, and use this to perform simultaneous spectroscopy to correlate field noise between the two sites. Our work demonstrates the first transport and coherent multi-zone operations in integrated photonic ion trap systems, forming the basis for further scaling in the trapped-ion QCCD architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that three different generalized similarities enclose all unitary and anti-unitary symmetries that induce exceptional points in lower-dimensional non-Hermitian systems. We prove that the generalized similarity conditions result in a larger class of systems than any class defined by a unitary or anti-unitary symmetry. Further we highlight that the similarities enforce spectral symmetry on the Hamiltonian resulting in a reduction of the codimension of exceptional points. As a consequence we show that the similarities drive the emergence of exceptional points in lower dimensions without the more restrictive need for a unitary and/or anti-unitary symmetry.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum circuit cuts with application to clustered Hamiltonian simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study methods to replace entangling operations with random local operations in a quantum computation, at the cost of increasing the number of required executions. First, we consider "space-like cuts" where an entangling unitary is replaced with random local unitaries. We propose an entanglement measure for quantum dynamics, the product extent, which bounds the cost in a procedure for this replacement based on two copies of the Hadamard test. In the terminology of prior work, this procedure yields a quasiprobability decomposition with minimal 1-norm in a number of cases, which addresses an open question of Piveteau and Sutter. As an application, we give an improved algorithm for clustered Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically we show that interactions can be removed at a cost which is exponential in the sum of their strengths times the evolution time, and vanishing in the limit of weak interactions.
  We also give an improved upper bound on the cost of replacing wires with measure-and-prepare channels using "time-like cuts''. We prove a matching information-theoretic lower bound when estimating output probabilities.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic systems with negative Wigner function superposition states are fundamentally witnessing nonlinear quantum dynamics beyond linearized systems and, recently, have become essential resources of quantum technology with many applications. Typically, they appear due to sophisticated combination of external drives, nonlinear control, measurements or strong nonlinear dissipation of subsystems to an environment. Here, we propose a conceptually different and more autonomous way to obtain such states, avoiding these ingredients, using purely sudden interaction decay in the paradigmatic interacting qubit-oscillator system weakly coupled to bath at thermal equilibrium in a low-temperature limit. We demonstrate simultaneously detectable unconditional negative Wigner function and quantum coherence and their qualitative enhancement employing more qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indistinguishability of identical particles is a resource for quantum information processing and has been utilized to generate entanglement from independent particles that spatially overlap only at the detection stage. Here we provide a general controllable scheme capable of generating, from a pure product state of $N$ qubits, a comprehensive class of multipartite entangled states, including W, Dicke, GHZ, and cluster states with both bosonic and fermionic statistics within the framework of spatially localized operations and classical communication (sLOCC). Using graph-based representations of the sLOCC framework, we translate the generation schemes of specific entangled states into colored, complex, and weighted digraphs, each corresponding to a given experimental setup. This graph-theoretical approach allows for precise targeting of particular multipartite states, exploration of diverse generation schemes, and optimization of generation efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the indistinguishability of identical graph nodes in quantum networks offers useful perspectives for photonic technology.</description>

Abstract: Channel simulation using coherence, which refers to realizing a target channel with coherent states and free operations, is a fundamental problem in the quantum resource theory of coherence. The limitations of the accuracy of deterministic channel simulation motivate us to consider the more general probabilistic framework. In this paper, we develop the framework for probabilistic channel simulation using coherence with free operations. When the chosen set of free operations is the maximally incoherent operations, we provide an efficiently computable semidefinite program (SDP) to calculate the maximal success probability and derive the analytic expression of success probability for some special cases. When the chosen set of free operations is the dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO), we show that if the target channel is not a resource nonactivating channel, then one cannot simulate it exactly both deterministically and probabilistically. The SDP for maximal success probability of simulating a channel by DIO is also given correspondingly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As current experiments already realize small quantum circuits on error corrected qubits, it is important to fully understand the effect of physical errors on the logical error channels of these fault-tolerant circuits. Here, we investigate a lattice-surgery-based CNOT operation between two surface code patches under phenomenological error models. (i) For two-qubit logical Pauli measurements -- the elementary building block of the CNOT -- we optimize the number of stabilizer measurement rounds, usually taken equal to $d$, the size (code distance) of each patch. We find that the optimal number can be greater or smaller than $d$, depending on the rate of physical and readout errors, and the separation between the code patches. (ii) We fully characterize the two-qubit logical error channel of the lattice-surgery-based CNOT. We find a symmetry of the CNOT protocol, that results in a symmetry of the logical error channel. We also find that correlations between X and Z errors on the logical level are suppressed under minimum weight decoding.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements, which underpins the phenomenon known as the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). However, typical decoherence noises disrupts the volume law phase, complicating the observation of MIPT on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise, thereby enabling its detection in experiment. The transition is characterized by the conditional entanglement entropy (CEE), which is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as competing external random fields. When the net external field is zero, a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition is expected, resulting in the MIPT. This zero-field condition also ensures an average apparatus-environment symmetry, making CEE a valid probe of entanglement and establishing the transition as a genuine entanglement phase transition. Additionally, we provide numerical results demonstrate the MIPT in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum circuit under dephasing noise. We also propose a method to estimate the noise rate, enabling the zero-field condition to be achieved experimentally and ensuring the feasibility of our protocol. Our result serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise.</description>

Abstract: Since their inception, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors have been enabling quantum optical applications and the rise of the photonic quantum industry. The evolution in the detector design and read-out strategies has led to the introduction of devices with a plurality of independent pixels, which have been able to operate with high system detection efficiency at high speed while also supporting photon number resolution capabilities. However, this comes at the cost of a complex readout that requires one coaxial cable for each pixel of the array. Here, we report a 28-pixel SNSPD with a dedicated parallel architecture that, while maintaining a simple readout with a single coaxial line, enables the detector to operate at high speed with low-performance degradation. The device shows a maximum single-photon efficiency of 88% and is able to maintain its efficiency above 50%, coupled with a timing jitter lower than 80 ps, up to a detection rate of 200 million counts per second. The detector also provides state-of-the-art photon-number-resolving performances with a 2-photon efficiency of 75% and a 3-photon efficiency of 62%.</description>

Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Low-Temperature Tunable Microcavity featuring High Passive Stability and Microwave Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open microcavities offer great potential for the exploration and utilization of efficient spin-photon interfaces with Purcell-enhanced quantum emitters thanks to their large spectral and spatial tunability combined with high versatility of sample integration. However, a major challenge for this platform is the sensitivity to cavity length fluctuations in the cryogenic environment, which leads to cavity resonance frequency variations and thereby a lowered averaged Purcell enhancement. This work presents a closed-cycle cryogenic fiber-based microcavity setup, which is in particular designed for a low passive vibration level, while still providing large tunability and flexibility in fiber and sample integration, and high photon collection efficiency from the cavity mode. At temperatures below 10 Kelvin, a stability level of around 25 picometer is reproducibly achieved in different setup configurations, including the extension with microwave control for manipulating the spin of cavity-coupled quantum emitters, enabling a bright photonic interface with optically active qubits.</description>

      <title>Bath Dynamical Decoupling with a Quantum Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bang-bang dynamical decoupling protects an open quantum system from decoherence due to its interaction with the surrounding bath/environment. In its standard form, this is achieved by strongly kicking the system with cycles of unitary operations, which average out the interaction Hamiltonian. In this paper, we generalize the notion of dynamical decoupling to repeated kicks with a quantum channel, which is applied to the bath. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the employed quantum channel and find that bath dynamical decoupling works if and only if the kick is ergodic. Furthermore, we study in which circumstances CPTP kicks on a mono-partite quantum system induce quantum Zeno dynamics with its Hamiltonian cancelled out. This does not require the ergodicity of the kicks, and the absence of decoherence-free subsystems is both necessary and sufficient. While the standard unitary dynamical decoupling is essentially the same as the quantum Zeno dynamics, our investigation implies that this is not true any more in the case of CPTP kicks. To derive our results, we prove some spectral properties of ergodic quantum channels, that might be of independent interest. Our approach establishes an enhanced and unified mathematical understanding of several recent experimental demonstrations and might form the basis of new dynamical decoupling schemes that harness environmental noise degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) heavily depends on statistical inference. For a broad class of protocols, the central statistical task is a random sampling problem, customarily addressed using exponential tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. Here we devise a strikingly simple exponential bound for this task, of unprecedented tightness among QKD security analyses. As a by-product, confidence intervals for the average of non-identical Bernoulli parameters follow too. These naturally fit in statistical analyses of decoy-state QKD and also outperform standard tools. Lastly, we show that, in a vast parameter regime, the use of tail bounds is not enforced because the cumulative mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is accurately computable. This sharply decreases the minimum block sizes necessary for QKD, and reveals the tightness of our simple analytical bounds when moderate-to-large blocks are considered.</description>

      <title>Theory and Experimental Demonstration of Wigner Tomography of Unknown Unitary Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tomography of unknown unitary quantum processes within the framework of a finite-dimensional Wigner-type representation. This representation provides a rich visualization of quantum operators by depicting them as shapes assembled as a linear combination of spherical harmonics. These shapes can be experimentally tomographed using a scanning-based phase-space tomography approach. However, so far, this approach was limited to $\textit{known}$ target processes and only provided information about the controlled version of the process rather than the process itself. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a general protocol to extend Wigner tomography to $\textit{unknown}$ unitary processes. This new method enables experimental tomography by combining a set of experiments with classical post-processing algorithms introduced herein to reconstruct the unknown process. We also demonstrate the tomography approach experimentally on IBM quantum devices and present the specific calibration circuits required for quantifying undesired errors in the measurement outcomes of these demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Magic State Injection on IBM Quantum Processors Above the Distillation Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface code family is a promising approach to implementing fault-tolerant quantum computations. Universal fault-tolerance requires error-corrected non-Clifford operations, in addition to Clifford gates, and for the former, it is imperative to experimentally demonstrate additional resources known as magic states. Another challenge is to efficiently embed surface codes into quantum hardware with connectivity constraints. This work simultaneously addresses both challenges by employing a qubit-efficient rotated heavy-hexagonal surface code for IBM quantum processors (\texttt{ibm\_fez}) and implementing the magic state injection protocol. Our work reports error thresholds for both logical bit- and phase-flip errors, of $\approx0.37\%$ and $\approx0.31\%$, respectively, which are higher than the threshold values previously reported with traditional embedding. The post-selection-based preparation of logical magic states $|H_L\rangle$ and $|T_L\rangle$ achieve fidelities of $0.8806\pm0.0002$ and $0.8665\pm0.0003$, respectively, which are both above the magic state distillation threshold. Additionally, we report the minimum fidelity among injected arbitrary single logical qubit states as $0.8356\pm0.0003$. Our work demonstrates the potential for realising non-Clifford logical gates by producing high-fidelity logical magic states on IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the expectation that relativistic symmetries might acquire quantum features in Quantum Gravity, we take the first steps towards a theory of ''Doubly'' Quantum Mechanics, a modification of Quantum Mechanics in which the geometrical configurations of physical systems, measurement apparata, and reference frame transformations are themselves quantized and described by ''geometry'' states in a Hilbert space. We develop the formalism for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ measurements by promoting the group of spatial rotations $SU(2)$ to the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ and generalizing the axioms of Quantum Theory in a covariant way. As a consequence of our axioms, the notion of probability becomes a self-adjoint operator acting on the Hilbert space of geometry states, hence acquiring novel non-classical features. After introducing a suitable class of semi-classical geometry states, which describe near-to-classical geometrical configurations of physical systems, we find that probability measurements are affected, in these configurations, by intrinsic uncertainties stemming from the quantum properties of $SU_q(2)$. This feature translates into an unavoidable fuzziness for observers attempting to align their reference frames by exchanging qubits, even when the number of exchanged qubits approaches infinity, contrary to the standard $SU(2)$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conversion of thermal energy into work is usually more efficient in the slow-driving regime, where the power output is vanishingly small. Efficient work extraction for fast driving protocols remains an outstanding challenge at the nanoscale, where fluctuations play a significant role. In this Letter, we use a quantum-dot Szilard engine to extract work from thermal fluctuations with maximum efficiency over two decades of driving speed. We design and implement a family of optimised protocols ranging from the slow- to the fast-driving regime, and measure the engine's efficiency as well as the mean and variance of its power output in each case. These optimised protocols exhibit significant improvements in power and efficiency compared to the naive approach. Our results also show that, when optimising for efficiency, boosting the power output of a Szilard engine inevitably comes at the cost of increased power fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement of qudit pairs, with single particle Hilbert space dimension $d$, has important potential for quantum information processing, with applications in cryptography, algorithms, and error correction. For a pair of qudits of arbitrary even dimension $d$, we introduce a generalized Bell basis with definite symmetry under exchange of states between the two particles. We show that no complete exchange-symmetrized basis can exist for odd $d$. This framework extends prior work on exchange-symmetrized hyperentangled qubit bases, where $d$ is a power of two. As a direct application of our basis, we quantify the number of qudit Bell states that can be unambiguously distinguished by devices restricted to linear evolution and local measurement (LELM). We show that for any even $d$, at most $2d-1$ states can be reliably distinguished, extending known results for $d = 2^n$ and $d=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce an algorithmic method to find the conservative energy and non-conservative power of a large class of maximally nonlinear electric circuits (including Josephson tunnel junctions, coherent quantum phase slips, and superconducting loops), based on the incidence matrix of the circuits' digraph. We consider two-port linear circuits with mostly holonomic constraints provided by either Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current rules or Maxwell-Kirchhoff's voltage rules. The circuit's independent variables, generally a superset of the degrees of freedom, are obtained from the solution space of Maxwell-Kirchhoff's current or voltage rules. The method does not require to find any Lagrangian. Instead, the circuit's classical or quantum Hamiltonian is obtained from the energy of the reactive (i.e., conservative) circuit elements by means of transformations complementary to Hamilton's equations. Dissipation (loss) is accounted for by using the Rayleigh dissipation function and defining generalized Poisson brackets--Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. Fluctuations (noise) are added as voltage or current sources characterized by bath modes. Non-conservative elements (e.g., noisy resistors) are included ab initio using the incidence-matrix method, without needing to treat them as separate elements. Finally, we show that in order to form a complete set of canonical coordinates, auxiliary (which could be parasitic in certain cases) circuit elements are required to find the Hamiltonian of circuits with an incomplete set of generalized velocities. In particular, we introduce two methods to eliminate the coordinates associated with the auxiliary elements by either Hamiltonian reduction or equation-of-motion reduction. We use auxiliary circuit elements to treat a maximally nonlinear circuit comprising simultaneously both a Josephson junction and a quantum phase slip.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems, focusing on generic features of systems that are ergodic, spatially extended, and lack conserved densities. Quantum circuits of various types provide simple models for such systems. We focus on Floquet quantum circuits, comparing their behaviour with what has been found previously for circuits that are random in time. Floquet circuits, which have discrete time-translation symmetry, represent an intermediate case between circuits that are random in time and lack any symmetry, and systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian and continuous time-translation invariance. By making this comparison, one of our aims is to identify signatures of time-translation symmetry in Floquet operator dynamics. To characterise behaviour we examine a variety of quantities in solvable models and numerically: operator autocorrelation functions; the partial spectral form factor; the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC); and the paths in operator space that make the dominant contributions to the ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions. Our most striking result is that ensemble-averaged autocorrelation functions show behaviour that is distinctively different in Floquet systems compared to systems in which successive time-steps are independent. Specifically, while average autocorrelation functions decay on a microscopic timescale for circuits that are random in time, in Floquet systems they have a late-time tail with a duration that grows parametrically with the size of the operator support. The existence of these tails provides a way to understand deviations of the spectral form factor from random matrix behaviour at times shorter than the Thouless time. In contrast to this feature in autocorrelation functions, we find no new aspects to the behaviour of OTOCs for Floquet models compared to random-in-time circuits.</description>

      <title>Scalar field with a time-independent classical source, not trivial after all: from vacuum decay to scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically it has been believed that a time-independent classical source has no effect on the scattering of relativistic uncharged field, in contrast with single particle quantum mechanics. In this work we show that the dynamics is not trivial. We solve exactly for the scattering amplitudes and find that a key ingredient is the production of particles from the unstable vacuum, conceptually similar to the Schwinger mechanism. We compute exactly the probabilities for the vacuum to decay in $n$ particles. The time dependence of such probabilities displays interesting properties such as the quantum Zeno effect and in particular has no regime where the exponential decay law is a good approximation. We show that the trivial scattering found in the past is the byproduct of the adiabatic switching of the interaction. In fact, it is not possible to switch off the interaction (adiabatically or otherwise) at distant times and recover the exact results. Finally, this non trivial vacuum behavior is a source of particle production. We argue that such non-perturbative calculations can be phenomenologically relevant for the production processes that are suppressed at the lower orders in perturbation theory, for instance dilaton production in a medium.</description>

      <title>Floquet-driven crossover from density-assisted tunneling to enhanced pair tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well potential using Floquet engineering. We demonstrate a crossover from a regime with density-assisted tunneling to dominant pair tunneling by tuning the effective interactions. Furthermore, we show that the pair tunneling rate can be enhanced not only compared to the Floquet-reduced single-particle tunneling but even beyond the static superexchange rate, while keeping the effective interaction in a relevant range. This opens possibilities to realize models with explicit pair tunneling in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Pole and zero edge state invariant for 1D non-Hermitian sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been several criteria for the existence of topological edge states in 1D non-Hermitian two-band sublattice-symmetric tight-binding Hamiltonians. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) approach uses the integration of the Berry connection over the GBZ contour in the complex wavevector space. An alternate `pole-zero' approach uses algebraic properties of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the sublattice-symmetric Hamiltonian in off-diagonal form. Both correctly predict the presence or absence of edge states, but there has not been an explicit proof of their equivalence. Here we provide such an explicit proof and moreover we extend the pole-zero approach so that it also applies for sublattice-symmetric models when the Hamiltonian is not in off-diagonal form. We give numerical examples for these invariants.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Strong Coupling and Its Induced Time Diffraction of Magnon Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-varying media break the temporal translation symmetry of wave propagation in materials, enabling advanced wave manipulations. However, this novel phenomenon has been rarely explored in magnonic systems due to the significant challenge of achieving a sudden and prominent change in magnon dispersion within materials. Here, we construct a time-varying strong coupling between two magnon modes, and observe a change in the beats of Rabi-like oscillations near the pulse edges. Using a frequency-comb spectroscopy technique developed in this work, we characterize the frequency conversion of magnon modes induced by the time-varying strong-coupling effect. Moreover, we construct time slits with adjacent time interfaces and demonstrate, for the first time, the double-slit time diffraction of magnon modes, analogous to the well-known Young's double-slit experiment. These findings rely solely on the time-varying strong magnon coupling, independent of device reconfiguration. Our results open avenues for applications such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.</description>

      <title>Discrete Quantum Walks with Marked Vertices and Their Average Vertex Mixing Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete quantum walk on a regular graph $X$ that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices $S$ and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix $\AMM$.
  We then find bounds for entries in $\AMM$, and study when these bounds are tight. In particular, the average probabilities between marked vertices are lower bounded by a matrix determined by the induced subgraph $X[S]$, the vertex-deleted subgraph $X\backslash S$, and the edge deleted subgraph $X-E(S)$. We show this bound is achieved if and only if the marked vertices have walk-equitable neighborhoods in the vertex-deleted subgraph. Finally, for quantum walks attaining this bound, we determine when $\AMM[S,S]$ is symmetric, positive semidefinite or uniform.</description>

      <title>Bound of Casimir Effect by Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kovtun-Son-Starinet bound, we propose that holography impose a lower bound on the Casimir effect. For simplicity, we focus on the Casimir effect between parallel planes for 3d conformal field theories and briefly comment on the generalizations to other boundary shapes and higher dimensions. Remarkably, the ghost-free holographic models impose a universal lower bound of the Casimir effect. We verify the holographic bound by free theories, Ising model, and $O(N)$ model with $N=2,3$ at critical points. Remarkably, the holographic bound is also obeyed by a general class of quantum field theories without conformal symmetries. It is interesting to find a field-theoretical proof or counterexample for the holographic bound of Casimir effect.</description>
