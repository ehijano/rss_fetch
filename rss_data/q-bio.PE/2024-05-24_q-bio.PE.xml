      <title>Jump-Switch-Flow: hybrid stochastic-deterministic solutions of compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many multi-scale systems exhibit stochastic and deterministic dynamics. Capturing these aspects in a compartmental model is challenging. Notably, low occupancy compartments exhibit stochastic dynamics and high occupancy compartments exhibit deterministic dynamics. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce 'atto-foxes', e.g. in the classic Lotka-Volterra ODE system. This can be resolved with discrete stochastic models e.g. continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is infeasible for most realistic populations. We develop a hybrid CTMC-ODE approach, 'Jump-Switch-Flow' (JSF), available as a Python package. JSF couples CTMCs and ODEs, and depending on the state of the system, individual compartments 'switch' between stochastic 'jumping' and deterministic 'flowing' representations. Consequently, compartments can reach extinct states, thereby resolving atto-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially faster that existing alternatives. JSF's value for inference problems, particularly multi-scale problems, is demonstrated with a case-study using a particle filter. With existing data of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we perform a novel analysis to quantify within-host viral clearance. JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model development and simulation.</description>

      <title>Lessons to learn for better safeguarding of genetic resources during tree pandemics: the case of ash dieback in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ash dieback (ADB) is threatening populations of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior &amp; F. angustifolia) for more than three decades. Although much knowledge has been gathered in the recent past, practical conservation measures have been mostly implemented at local scale. Since range contraction in both ash species will be exacerbated in the near future by westward expansion of the emerald ash borer and climate change, systematic conservation frameworks need to be developed to avoid long-term population-genetic consequences and depletion of genomic diversity. In this article, we address the advantages and obstacles of conservation approaches aiming to conserve genetic diversity in-situ or ex-situ during tree pandemics. We are reviewing 47 studies which were published on ash dieback to unravel three important dimensions of ongoing conservation approaches or perceived conservation problems: i) conservation philosophy (i.e. natural selection, resistance breeding or genetic conservation), ii) the spatial scale (ecosystem, country, continent), and iii) the integration of genetic safety margins in conservation planning. Although nearly equal proportions of the reviewed studies mention breeding or active conservation as possible long-term solutions, only 17% consider that additional threats exist which may further reduce genetic diversity in both ash species. We also identify and discuss several knowledge gaps and limitations which may have limited the initiation of conservation projects at national and international level so far. Finally, we demonstrate that there is not much time left for filling these gaps, because European-wide forest health monitoring data indicates a significant decline of ash populations in the last 5 years.</description>

      <title>DendroPy 5: a mature Python library for phylogenetic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary bioinformatics has seen in profound new visibility into the composition, structure, and history of the natural world around us. Arguably, the central pillar of bioinformatics is phylogenetics -- the study of hereditary relatedness among organisms. Insight from phylogenetic analysis has touched nearly every corner of biology. Examples range across natural history, population genetics and phylogeography, conservation biology, public health, medicine, in vivo and in silico experimental evolution, application-oriented evolutionary algorithms, and beyond.
  High-throughput genetic and phenotypic data has realized groundbreaking results, in large part, through conjunction with open-source software used to process and analyze it. Indeed, the preceding decades have ushered in a flourishing ecosystem of bioinformatics software applications and libraries. Over the course of its nearly fifteen-year history, the DendroPy library for phylogenetic computation in Python has established a generalist niche in serving the bioinformatics community. Here, we report on the recent major release of the library, DendroPy version 5. The software release represents a major milestone in transitioning the library to a sustainable long-term development and maintenance trajectory. As such, this work positions DendroPy to continue fulfilling a key supporting role in phyloinformatics infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Generating-functional analysis of random Lotka-Volterra systems: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides what is hopefully a self-contained set of notes describing the detailed steps of a generating-functional analysis of systems of generalised Lotka-Volterra equations with random interaction coefficients. Nothing in these notes is original, instead the generating-functional method (also known as the Martin-Siggia-Rose-DeDominic-Janssen formalism) and the resulting dynamic mean field theories have been used for the study of disordered systems and spin glasses for decades. But it is hard to find unifying sources which would allow a beginner to learn step-by-step how these methods can be used. My aim is to provide such a source. Most of the calculations are specific to generalised Lotka-Volterra systems, but much can be transferred to disordered systems in more general.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Based Epidemiological Modelling Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by chemical reaction rules, we introduce a rule-based epidemiological framework for the systematic mathematical modelling of future pandemics. Here we stress that we do not have a specific model in mind, but a whole collection of models which can be transformed into each other, or represent different aspects of a pandemic, and these aspects can change during the course of the emergency, as happened during the Covid-19 pandemic. As conditions for outbreaks in the modern world change on different time-scales, some rapidly, epidemiology has few 'laws', besides perhaps the fundamental infection process described by Kermack-McKendrick. Each single of our variety of models, called framework, is based on a mathematical formulation that we call a rule-based system. They have several advantages, for example that they can be both interpreted stochastically and deterministically, without changing the model structure. Rule-based systems should be easier to communicate to non-specialists, when compared to differential equations. Due to their combinatorial nature, the rule-based model framework we propose is ideal for systematic mathematical modelling, systematic links to statistics, data analysis in general and also machine learning leading to artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Epidemiological impacts of age structures on human malaria transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the most common mosquito-borne diseases widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, causing thousands of deaths every year in the world. In a previous paper, we formulated an age-structured model containing three structural variables: (i) the chronological age of human and mosquito populations, (ii) the time since they are infected, and (iii) humans waning immunity (i.e. the progressive loss of protective antibodies after recovery). In the present paper, we expand the analysis of this age-structured model and focus on the derivation of entomological and epidemiological results commonly used in the literature, following the works of Smith and McKenzie. We generalize their results to the age-structured case. In order to quantify the impact of neglecting structuring variables such as chronological age, we assigned values from the literature to our model parameters. While some parameters values are readily accessible from the literature, at least those about the human population, the parameters concerning mosquitoes are less commonly documented and the values of a number of them (e.g. mosquito survival in the presence or in absence of infection) can be discussed extensively.</description>

      <title>Imitation dynamics and the replicator equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>

      <title>PhyloLM : Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metrics based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</description>

      <title>Power-law relaxation of a confined diffusing particle subject to resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a Brownian particle with long range memory under confinement in one dimension. The particle diffuses in an arbitrary confining potential and resets at random times to previously visited positions, chosen with a probability proportional to the local time spent there by the particle since the initial time. This model mimics an animal which moves erratically in its home range and returns preferentially to familiar places from time to time, as observed in nature. The steady state density of the position is given by the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, as in standard diffusion, while the transient part of the density can be obtained through a mapping of the Fokker-Planck equation of the process to a Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem. Due to memory, the approach at large time toward the steady state is critically self-organised, in the sense that it always follows a sluggish power-law form, in contrast to the exponential decay that characterises Markov processes. The exponent of this power-law depends in a simple way on the resetting rate and on the leading relaxation rate of the Brownian particle in the absence of resetting. We apply these findings to several exactly solvable examples, such as the harmonic, V-shaped and box potentials.</description>
