      <title>Multi-Scale Fiber Remodeling in HCM Using a Stress-Based Fiber Reorientation Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying fiber disarray, which is a prominent maladaptation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, remains critical to understanding the disease's complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous impairment of fiber contractility and fibrosis in the induction of disarray and their subsequent impact on cardiac pumping function. Fiber disarray is modeled via a stress-based fiber reorientation law within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework called MyoFE. Using multiscale modeling capabilities, this study quantifies the distinct impacts of hypocontractility, hypercontractility and fibrosis on the development of fiber disarray and quantifies how their contributions affect the functional characteristics of the heart.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ''hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>VascX Models: Model Ensembles for Retinal Vascular Analysis from Color Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VascX models, a comprehensive set of model ensembles for analyzing retinal vasculature from color fundus images (CFIs). Annotated CFIs were aggregated from public datasets for vessel, artery-vein, and disc segmentation; and fovea localization. Additional CFIs from the population-based Rotterdam Study were, with arteries and veins annotated by graders at pixel level. Our models achieved robust performance across devices from different vendors, varying levels of image quality levels, and diverse pathologies. Our models demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to existing systems under a variety of conditions. Significant enhancements were observed in artery-vein and disc segmentation performance, particularly in segmentations of these structures on CFIs of intermediate quality, a common characteristic of large cohorts and clinical datasets. Our model outperformed human graders in segmenting vessels with greater precision. With VascX models we provide a robust, ready-to-use set of model ensembles and inference code aimed at simplifying the implementation and enhancing the quality of automated retinal vasculature analyses. The precise vessel parameters generated by the model can serve as starting points for the identification of disease patterns in and outside of the eye.</description>
