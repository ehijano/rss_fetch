      <title>Exploring shell effects in fission yields of neutron-deficient Th, Ac, and Ra isotopes near N=126</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of nuclear fission over recent decades have led to a well-defined mapping of neutron and proton shell effects across the nuclear chart, particularly within the valley of stability. These shell effects play a crucial role in driving the asymmetric splitting of fissioning nuclei, as reflected in fission yields that are strongly influenced by spherical and deformed shell closures. In the actinide region, the existence of two primary fission modes, standard I and standard II, has been well-established. These fission modes are associated with the proton (neutron) shells at $Z=52$ ($N=82$) and $Z=56$ ($N=88$), respectively. Recently, a new proton shell around $Z=36$ has been found for the lighter fission fragments of pre-actinide nuclei. This discovery demonstrates that as we expand fission studies towards more exotic regions of the nuclear chart, new shell structures emerge. In this proposal, we aim to explore for the first time the most neutron-deficient isotopes of Th, Ac, and Ra. This region offers a unique opportunity to investigate stabilization effects around the spherical neutron shell $N=50$. To achieve this, we plan to use a primary beam of $^{238}$U at 1~GeV/u together with the Fragment Separator (FRS) to produce secondary beams of $^{213-216}$Th, $^{209-214}$Ac and $^{207-213}$Ra. For the investigation of the fission process, we will use the experimental methodology successfully applied in the S415, S438, and S455 experiments, being a continuation of those studies. Fission will be induced by electromagnetic-excitation (Coulex) reactions in inverse kinematics on an active target composed of Pb and C foils. The resulting fission fragments, together with emitted neutrons, will be measured using the R$^3$B experimental setup, which allows for complete kinematic measurements.</description>

      <title>Polarization Observables $T$ and $F$ in the $\gamma p \to \pi^0 p$ Reaction at CLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion photoproduction in the $\overrightarrow\gamma\overrightarrow p \to \pi^0 p$ reaction has been measured in the FROST experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. In this experiment, circularly polarized photons with energies up to 3.082 GeV impinged on a transversely polarized frozen-spin target. Final-state protons were detected in the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer. Results of the polarization observables $T$ and $F$ have been extracted for $W$ from 1445 MeV to 2525 MeV. The data generally agree with predictions of present partial-wave analyses, but also show marked differences for higher $W$ ranges. By incorporating the present data into the databases, the SAID fits have been improved with relatively small $\chi^2$ and significant changes in the parameters of the $\Delta(1910)1/2^+$ and $N(2190)7/2^-$ have been found with the J\"uBo model.</description>

      <title>Studying the onset of deconfinement at NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of particle production in high-energy collisions of heavy ions offers a unique opportunity to explore the phase transition of strongly interacting matter. The NA61/SHINE experiment, a fixed-target setup located in the CERN SPS North Area, plays a crucial role in this investigation. To perform a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter, the experiment varies both the beam momentum (ranging from 13 to 150/158 GeV/c per nucleon) and the size of the colliding ions (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This article presents a study of the properties of the onset of deconfinement by measuring the K+/pi+ ratio, which is proportional to the strangeness to entropy ratio of the produced system. New results from central Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c, focusing on the spectra of charged kaons and pions, confirm the presence of the horn structure in the energy dependence of the K+/pi+ ratio, consistent with earlier observations by NA49 and STAR, which could be interpreted as a hint of the onset of deconfinement at middle SPS energies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the branching ratio of $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ isotopes through the nuclear muon capture reaction in the Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Super-Kamiokande detector has measured solar neutrinos for more than $25$ years. The sensitivity for solar neutrino measurement is limited by the uncertainties of energy scale and background modeling. Decays of unstable isotopes with relatively long half-lives through nuclear muon capture, such as $\mathrm{^{16}N}$, $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$ and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$, are detected as background events for solar neutrino observations. In this study, we developed a method to form a pair of stopping muon and decay candidate events and evaluated the production rates of such unstable isotopes. We then measured their branching ratios considering both their production rates and the estimated number of nuclear muon capture processes as $Br(\mathrm{^{16}N})=(9.0 \pm 0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{15}C})=(0.6\pm0.1)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{12}B})=(0.98 \pm 0.18)\%$, $Br(\mathrm{^{13}B})=(0.14 \pm 0.12)\%$, respectively. The result for $\mathrm{^{16}N}$ has world-leading precision at present and the results for $\mathrm{^{15}C}$, $\mathrm{^{12}B}$, and $\mathrm{^{13}B}$ are the first branching ratio measurements for those isotopes.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in $^{86}$Kr via deuteron inelastic scattering using an active target CAT-M</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteron inelastic scattering on $^{86}$Kr was measured in inverse kinematics with the gaseous active target CAT-M, as part of a systematic investigation aimed at determining the nuclear matter incompressibility. The isoscalar monopole strength distribution was extracted via multipole decomposition analysis, and the energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance was determined to be 17 $\pm$ 1 MeV. The nuclear incompressibility of $^{86}$Kr and the isospin-dependent term of the nuclear matter incompressibility are discussed.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurements of the Neutron Magnetic Form Factor to High Momentum Transfer using Durand's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic electron-nucleon scattering provides insights into the spatial distributions of charge and current within nucleons through their electromagnetic form factors. Accurate knowledge of these form factors over a broad range of $Q^2$, the squared four-momentum transfer in the scattering process, reveals details about the nucleon's internal structure. However, high-$Q^2$ data of the nucleon electromagnetic form factor is scarce due to the challenges associated with such measurements. This thesis reports preliminary results from high-precision measurements of the neutron magnetic form factor ($G_M^n$) to unprecedented $Q^2$ using Durand's method, also known as the "ratio" method. Systematic errors are greatly reduced by extracting $G_M^n$ from the ratio of neutron-coincident ($D(e,e'n)$) to proton-coincident ($D(e,e'p)$) quasi-elastic electron scattering from deuteron. The scattered electrons were detected in the BigBite spectrometer, which features multiple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) layers with large active area for high-precision tracking at very high rates. Simultaneous nucleon detection was performed by the Super BigBite spectrometer, which utilizes a dipole magnet with large solid angle acceptance at forward angles and a novel hadron calorimeter with very high and comparable detection efficiencies for both protons and neutrons. This setup could handle very high luminosity, making high-$Q^2$ measurements feasible. Data were collected at five $Q^2$ points: $3,$ $4.5,$ $7.4,$ $9.9,$ and $13.6$ (GeV/c)$^2$. Preliminary results are reported for all, with the lowest two $Q^2$ points in good agreement with existing world data, while the higher points significantly extend the $Q^2$ range in which $G_M^n$ is known accurately. The precision of the highest $Q^2$ point is expected to remain unmatched for years to come.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Tritium Production in Irradiated TiD2 from Collisional Fusion in the Solid-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing research in new nuclear mechanisms hold the potential for beneficial developments in nuclear power cycle designs. Recent reports investigated the possibility of lattice dynamics to influence nuclear processes in metals. Results from Steinetz et al., at the NASA Glenn Research Center indicated that it may be feasible to initiate deuterium deuterium fusion reactions that are enhanced using electron screening to reduce the deuterium deuterium fusion barrier. This article presents tritium production results from both simulations and experiments targeting specific nuclear processes in an effort to identify the source of higher energy neutrons observed in those results. We explore two pathways of tritium generation in TiD2 through this fusion cycle. Tritium production from TiD2 in the University of Missouri Research Reactor, where the neutron spectrum was approximately 90 percent thermal, was within 25 percent of the predicted amount from simulations, and well explained by known nuclear reactions without invoking screening enhanced recoil-induced fusion. Tritium production from TiD2 in the cyclotron vault at MURR, where the neutron spectrum was completely energetic with almost no thermal neutrons, was a factor of 2.9 to 5.1 times higher than predicted from simulations using known nuclear reactions. This indicates the likelihood of an additional mechanism, such as collision-induced fusion in the solid state, increasing the credibility in the results from Steinetz et al.</description>

      <title>Baryon Electric Charge Correlation as QCD Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is crucial for observing effects such as the chiral magnetic effect but has proven exceptionally difficult. To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge correlation $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows us to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the collision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar collisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays via combined multi-transition analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments, with projected half-life sensitivities approaching $10^{28}$ years, aim to fully probe the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering. However, this discovery potential remains uncertain, as it depends sensitively on the nuclear matrix element, which exhibits significant model dependence. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to enhance experimental sensitivity by performing a combined analysis of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay to both the ground state and the first excited $0^+$ state of the daughter nucleus. This approach is particularly promising for large liquid xenon detectors, such as the proposed PandaX-xT and XLZD experiments, which are capable of identifying decays of $^{136}$Xe to excited states with high efficiency. Our analysis demonstrates that such a combined multi-transition analysis can improve the sensitivity to $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ by more than a factor of two for a nominal xenon detector setup, and by up to an order of magnitude in an ideal scenario, potentially accelerating access to the entire inverted ordering regime. These findings underscore the importance of probing multiple decay channels simultaneously in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches to maximize discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Probing In-Medium Effect via Giant Dipole Resonance in the Extended Quantum Molecular Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article uses a stochastic approach to analyze the collision term, rather than the geometric method used in the original EQMD model, to examine the width of the isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) in ${}^{208}$Pb. Based on the ``soft" EQMD model, the response and strength functions are self-consistently determined for various symmetry energy coefficient and in-medium reduction factor values. The results confirm that the peak position and GDR width in ${}^{208}$Pb are highly sensitive to the symmetry energy and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon ({\it NN}) cross section. This provides an opportunity to study the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and the medium effect. A significant reduction in free {\it NN} elastic cross sections within the medium is necessary to accurately reproduce the GDR width, as demonstrated by a comparison with evaluation data.</description>

      <title>Probing the spectral width of the 12.4-keV solid-state $^{45}$Sc isomeric resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17538</link>

Abstract: The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</description>

      <title>Two-flavored heavy mesons' nuclear bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the $B_c$- and $B_s$-nucleus bound state energies and coordinate space radial wave functions by solving the Klein-Gordon equation in momentum space. The attractive strong potentials for the $B_c$ and $B_s$ mesons in nuclei are calculated from the respective mass shifts of these mesons in nuclear matter using a local density approximation. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in medium in an empirical sense, because the origin of the negative mass shift in the present study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism.</description>

      <title>Bottom quark energy loss and hadronization with B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ nuclear modification factors using pp and PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>

Abstract: The production cross sections of B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ and B$^+$ mesons are reported in proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 302 pb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are based on measurements of the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ $\to$ J/$\psi (\mu^+\mu^-)\phi$(1020) (K$^+$K$^-$) and B$^+$ $\to$ J/$\psi (\mu^+\mu^-)$K$^+$ decay channels. Results are presented in the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) range 7-50 GeV/$c$ and the rapidity interval $\lvert y \rvert$ $\lt$ 2.4 for the B mesons. The measured $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential cross sections of B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ in pp collisions are well described by fixed-order plus next-to-leading logarithm perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Using previous PbPb collision measurements at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy, the nuclear modification factors, $R_\mathrm{AA}$, of the B mesons are determined. For $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 10 GeV/$c$, both mesons are found to be suppressed in PbPb collisions (with $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values significantly below unity), with less suppression observed for the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ mesons. In this $p_\mathrm{T}$ range, the $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values for the B$^+$ mesons are consistent with those for inclusive charged hadrons and D$^0$ mesons. Below 10 GeV/$c$, both B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ are found to be less suppressed than either inclusive charged hadrons or D$^0$ mesons, with the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ $R_\mathrm{AA}$ value consistent with unity. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values found for the B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ are compared to theoretical calculations, providing constraints on the mechanism of bottom quark energy loss and hadronization in the quark-gluon plasma, the hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments at the RIBF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-intensity radioactive ion beams has opened new avenues for nuclear structure research. By studying exotic ions, phenomena such as shell evolution, halos, and the limits of stability have been studied. In particular, Quasi-Free Scattering (QFS) experiments on hydrogen targets have proven to be a valuable tool to investigate the structure of exotic ions. Recently, a series of QFS experiments were performed at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) of the RIKEN Nishina Center employing the MINOS liquid hydrogen system. A fundamental part of the success of these experiments was the use of dedicated devices to measure the gamma-rays, charged particles, and neutrons emitted in the reactions. The experience gained during the past campaigns, as well as the upcoming upgrade of the RIBF facility call for improvements on the existing devices, as well as for the development of new detection systems. Here we review the main detection devices used at the RIBF for QFS experiments, and give an overview of the ongoing and upcoming developments.</description>

      <title>Refinement of an analytical capture cross section formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical formula with high accuracy is proposed for a systematic description of the capture cross sections at near-barrier energies from light to superheavy reaction systems. Based on the empirical barrier distribution (EBD) method, three key input quantities are refined by introducing nuclear surface correction to the Coulomb parameter $z$ for calculating the barrier height, incorporating the reaction $Q$-value and shell correction into the barrier distribution width calculations, and considering the deep inelastic scattering effects of superheavy systems on the barrier radius. With these refinements, not only the accuracy of the calculated barrier height but also the accuracy of the predicted capture cross sections, is substantially improved. The average deviation (in logarithmic scale) between the predicted cross sections and the experimental data for a total of 426 reaction systems with $ 35 &lt; Z_1 Z_2 &lt; 2600$ is sharply reduced from 3.485 to 0.113.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TD-CDFT) combined with angular momentum projection is developed and applied to study multinucleon transfer (MNT) reactions, with a focus on the intrinsic angular momentum distributions of the final fragments. Using the illustrative reaction $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb across a range of impact parameters, we find that the MNT process generates broad distributions of intrinsic spins. These distributions arise from the conversion of relative orbital angular momentum into intrinsic spin due to frictional interactions between the colliding nuclei. Additionally, mutual information (entanglement Shannon entropy) is employed to analyze correlations between the intrinsic spins of the fragments.</description>
