      <title>The Perseid and Geminid meteor shower activity over Hungary in 2019-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present statistical analysis of video meteor observations for the Perseid and Geminid showers taken with two camera systems operating in Hungary from the end of 2019 through 2023. Zenithal hourly rates (ZHR) and meteor fluxes, determined by MetRec-based analog video cameras HUKON, HUPIS and HUHOD, are inferred and compared with detections of slow fireballs measured at the same sites by a system consisting of automated DSLR cameras (the KoMON system).</description>

      <title>The Search for the Inbetweeners: How packed are TESS planetary systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine seven systems discovered by TESS, to see whether there is any room in those systems for an additional planet (or several) to lurk unseen between the two planets already confirmed therein. In five of those systems (namely HD 15337; HD 21749; HD 63433; HD 73583 and LTT 3780) we find that there is ample room for an undiscovered planet to move between those that have already been discovered. In other words, as they currently stand, those systems are not tightly packed. In stark contrast, the perturbative influence of the two known TOI-1670 planets is such that additional planets in between are ruled out. The final system, TOI 421, is more challenging. In the vast majority of cases, adding an Earth-mass planet to that system between the orbits of the known planets caused catastrophic instability. Just ~1.1% of our simulations of the modified system proved dynamically stable on a timescale of one million years. As a result, it seems that there is very little room between the two known planets in the TOI 421 system for an addition unseen world to exist, but the existence of such a planet can not be definitely ruled out on dynamical grounds alone.</description>

      <title>Dust mass in protoplanetary disks with porous dust opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA surveys have suggested that protoplanetary disks are not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population, under the assumption that the millimeter continuum emission is optically thin. In this work, we investigate how the mass determination is influenced when the porosity of dust grains is considered in radiative transfer models. The results show that disks with porous dust opacities yield similar dust temperature, but systematically lower millimeter fluxes compared to disks incorporating compact dust grains. Moreover, we recalibrate the relation between dust temperature and stellar luminosity for a wide range of stellar parameters, and calculate the dust masses of a large sample of disks using the traditionally analytic approach. The median dust mass from our calculation is about 6 times higher than the literature result, and this is mostly driven by the different opacities of porous and compact grains. A comparison of the cumulative distribution function between disk dust masses and exoplanet masses show that the median exoplanet mass is about 2 times lower than the median dust mass, if grains are porous, and there are no exoplanetary systems with masses higher than the most massive disks. Our analysis suggests that adopting porous dust opacities may alleviate the mass budget problem for planet formation. As an example illustrating the combined effects of optical depth and porous dust opacities on the mass estimation, we conduct new IRAM/NIKA-2 observations toward the IRAS 04370+2559 disk and perform a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution. The best-fit dust mass is roughly 100 times higher than the value from the traditionally analytic calculation. Future spatially resolved observations at various wavelengths are required to better constrain the dust mass.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Evolution of Hot Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have shown that the strength of planetary magnetic fields depends on the convective energy flux emerging from planetary interiors. Here we model the interior structure of gas giant planets using \texttt{MESA}, to determine the convective energy flux that can drive the generation of magnetic field. This flux is then incorporated in the Christensen et al. dynamo formalism to estimate the maximum dipolar magnetic field $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ of our simulated planets. First, we explore how the surface field of intensely irradiated hot Jupiters ($\sim 300 M_\oplus$) and hot Neptunes ($\sim 20 M_\oplus$) evolve as they age. Assuming an orbital separation of 0.1 au, for the hot Jupiters, we find that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ evolves from 240 G at 500 Myr to 120 G at 5~Gyr. For hot Neptunes, the magnetic field evolves from 11 G at young ages and dies out at $\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of atmospheric mass fraction, atmospheric evaporation, orbital separations $\alpha$ and additional planetary masses on the derived $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$. We found that $B^\mathrm{(max)}_\mathrm{dip}$ increases with $\alpha$ for very close-in planets and plateaus out after that. Higher atmospheric mass fractions lead in general to stronger surface fields, because they allow for more extensive dynamo regions and stronger convection.</description>

      <title>A generative model for Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs: selection functions for binary stars, giant planets, and compact object companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.</description>

      <title>Stellar surface information from the Ca II H&amp;K lines -- II. Defining better activity proxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our former paper I, we showed on the Sun that different active regions possess unique intensity profiles on the Ca II H &amp; K lines. We now extend the analysis by showing how those properties can be used on real stellar observations, delivering more powerful activity proxies for radial velocity correction. More information can be extracted on rotational timescale from the Ca II H &amp; K lines than the classical indicators: S-index and log(R'HK). For high-resolution HARPS observations of alpha Cen B, we apply a principal and independent component analysis on the Ca II H &amp; K spectra time-series to disentangle the different sources that contribute to the disk-integrated line profiles. While the first component can be understood as a denoised version of the Mount-Wilson S-index, the second component appears as powerful activity proxies to correct the RVs induced by the inhibition of the convective blueshift in stellar active regions. However, we failed to interpret the extracted component into a physical framework. We conclude that a more complex kernel or bandpass than the classical triangular of the Mount Wilson convention should be used to extract activity proxies. To this regard, we provide the first principal component activity profile obtained across the spectral type sequence between M1V to F9V type stars.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 2000$ days.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>
