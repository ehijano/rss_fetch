      <title>Shell-model study of $^{28}$Si: coexistence of oblate, prolate and superdeformed shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shape coexistence in the nucleus $^{28}$Si with the nuclear shell model using numerical diagonalizations complemented with variational calculations based on the projected generator-coordinate method. The theoretical electric quadrupole moments and transitions as well as the collective wavefunctions indicate that the standard USDB interaction in the $sd$ shell describes well the ground-state oblate rotational band, but misses the experimental prolate band. Guided by the quasi-SU(3) model, we show that the prolate band can be reproduced in the $sd$ shell by reducing the energy of the $0d_{3/2}$ orbital. Alternatively, in the extended $sdpf$ configuration space the SDPF-NR interaction, which describes well other Si isotopes, also reproduces the oblate and prolate bands. Finally, we address the possibility of superdeformation in $^{28}$Si within the $sdpf$ space. Our results disfavour the appearance of superdeformed states with excitation energy below 20 MeV.</description>

      <title>Parameter dependence of the $\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parameter dependence of the calculated $\beta$-decay properties, as well as low-lying states for the neutron-rich Zr isotopes within the neutron-proton interacting boson model (IBM-2) and interacting boson-fermion-fermion model (IBFFM-2). It is shown that the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the transitions of the $0^+_1$ ground states of the parent even-even nuclei $^{96-102}$Zr into the $1^+_1$ states of the daughter odd-odd nuclei $^{96-102}$Nb consistently exhibit a strong dependence on those parameters associated with the quadrupole-quadrupole boson interaction, and with the residual interaction between an unpaired neutron and an unpaired proton in the IBFFM-2 Hamiltonian for the odd-odd Nb nuclei. By the reduction in magnitude of the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction strength by approximately a factor of 2, the calculated $\log_{10}ft$ values for the Zr$(0^+_1)\to$Nb$(1^+_1)$ transitions increase and agree with the experimental values. This points to a significant improvement over the previous study performed in the same mass region, that consists in the mapping from a relativistic energy density functional calculation onto the IBM-2 Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Properties of quark stars based on the density-dependent MIT bag model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we extend the MIT bag model by incorporating the vector interaction among quarks and introducing a density-dependent bag pressure. Then we proceed to investigate the thermodynamic properties of strange quark matter (SQM) and pure up-down quark matter (udQM) in quark stars. The results demonstrate that the vector interaction among quarks and the densitydependent bag pressure have significant impacts on the equation of state for both SQM and udQM. The inclusion of GV , which represents the strength of vector interactions, results in a stiffening of equation of state while maintaining causality. This allows for the description of massive compact stars such as those observed in GW190814 and PSR J0740+6620 as quark stars. Ultimately, we utilize the vMIT bag model to derive a series of mass-radius relations of quark stars (QSs) which is consistent with the astronomical observations from HESS J1731-347, 4U 1702-429, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817 and GW190814.</description>

      <title>Nuclear mass predictions based on convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to investigate nuclear mass. By introducing the masses of neighboring nuclei and the paring effects at the input layer of the network, local features of the target nucleus are extracted to predict its mass. Then, through learning the differences between the predicted nuclear masses by the WS4 model and the experimental nuclear masses, a new global-local model (CNN-WS4) is developed, which incorporates both the global nuclear mass model and local features. This model achieves an accuracy of 0.070 MeV for the nuclei with $Z\geqslant8$ and $N\geqslant8$ in AME2016, significantly enhancing the accuracy of nuclear mass prediction. When extrapolating for newly emerged nuclei in AME2020, the CNN-WS4 also exhibits appreciable stability, thereby demonstrating its robustness.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory for Spontaneously Broken Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a preprint of an open-access book published by Springer Cham. The book gives an up-to-date overview of the physics of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry from the point of view of effective field theory. Upon building up the necessary foundations, the text reviews the classification of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and then focuses on the construction of the effective-field-theoretic description of their dynamics. Both internal and spacetime broken symmetries are covered, including numerous illustrative examples and a few selected applications, worked out in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Investigating $\Xi$ resonances from pentaquark perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the $qss\bar{q}q$ ($q = u$ or $d$) system to find possible pentaquark explanations for the $\Xi$ resonances. The bound state calculation is carried out within the framework of the quark delocalization color screening model. The scattering processes are also studied to examine the possible resonance states. The current results indicate that the $\Xi(1950)$ can be interpreted as $\Lambda \bar{K}^*$ state with $J^P = 1/2^-$. Three states are identified that match the $\Xi(2250)$, which are $\Sigma^* \bar{K}^*$ state with $J^P = 3/2^-$, $\Sigma^* \bar{K}^*$ state with $J^P =5/2^-$, and $\Xi^* \rho$ state with $J^P =5/2^-$. This may explain the conflicting experimental values for the width of the $\Xi(2250)$. A new $\Xi$ resonance is predicted, whose mass and width are 2066--2079 MeV and 186--189 MeV, respectively. These results contribute to understanding the nature of the $\Xi$ resonances and to the future search for new $\Xi$ resonances. Moreover, it is meaningful to further investigate the $\Xi$ resonances from an unquenched picture on the basis of pentaquark investigation.</description>

      <title>Two-body problem of impurity atoms in dipolar Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarized dipolar Fermi gas shows exotic properties at low temperatures, characterized by an axially-deformed Fermi surface and anisotropic single-particle energy, due to the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interaction. In cold-atom experiments such a system has been realized, e.g., in degenerate gas of Er and Dy atoms. In the case that non-dipolar impurity atoms are introduced in such system, they undergoes an induced interaction mediated by the density fluctuations of the background dipolar Fermi gas. We derive the induced interaction potential to the single-loop order of fluctuations and show that it becomes indeed an anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type potential which preserves the axial symmetry around the polarization axis. We then solve the two-body problem of impurity atoms interacting via the anisotropic potential and figure out the dependence of bound state and scattering properties on the parameters of dipolar Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Estimating Longitudinal Polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ Hyperons at Relativistic Energies using Hydrodynamic and Transport models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global and local polarization measurements of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons by STAR and ALICE Collaborations open up an immense interest in investigating the polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Recent studies suggest the transverse component of the vorticity field is responsible for the global spin polarization, while the longitudinal component of the vorticity field accounts for the local polarization. The local polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperons arises due to the anisotropic flows in the transverse plane, indicating a quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity along the beam direction. The present study focuses on the local (longitudinal) polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Further, we explore the centrality and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence of longitudinal polarization using hydrodynamic and transport models. All these models predict a maximum longitudinal polarization in mid-central collisions around 30-50 \% centrality at $p_{\rm T} \approx$ 2.0 - 3.0 GeV/c. These findings on longitudinal polarization advocate the existence of a thermal medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Our findings are in agreement with corresponding experimental data at the RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision kernel is employed in the Boltzmann equation to formulate relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics. In this formulation, we find that there remains freedom of choosing a matching condition that affects the scalar transport in the system. We also propose a new collision kernel which, unlike BGK collision kernel, is valid in the limit of zero chemical potential and derive relativistic first-order dissipative hydrodynamics using it. We study the effects of this new formulation on the coefficient of bulk viscosity.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of the neutral pion longitudinal screening mass in the linear sigma model with quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the linear sigma model with quarks to study the magnetic-field-induced modifications on the longitudinal screening mass for the neutral pion at one-loop level. The effects of the magnetic field are introduced into the self-energy, which contains the contributions from all the model particles. We find that, to obtain a reasonable description for the behavior with the field strength, we need to account for the magnetic field dependence of the particle masses. We also find that the couplings need to decrease fast enough with the field strength to then reach constant and smaller values as compared to their vacuum ones. The results illustrate the need to treat the magnetic corrections to the particle masses and couplings in a self-consistent manner, accounting for the backreaction of the field effects for the magnetic field dependence of the rest of the particle species and couplings in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the mass radius, scalar radius, tensor radius, baryon number radius and mechanical radius of nuclei with baryon number $B=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,32,108$ in the Skyrme model. The relations between these radii and the nuclear gravitational form factors are investigated. We also compute the `pressure' distribution and find that it is negative in the core region for all the nuclei with $B&gt;1$. This suggests that the way mechanical stability is achieved in nuclei is qualitatively different than in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the Pseudoscalar Meson Octet and the Baryon Decuplet in the Continuum and a Finite Volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the interaction of the pseudoscalar meson octet and the baryon decuplet. In the continuum, it is observed that several $J^{P}=\frac32^-$ baryon resonances can be produced by the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction in unitarized chiral perturbation theory, including the $N(1875)$, $\Sigma(1670)$, $\Sigma(1910)$, $\Xi(1820)$ and $\Omega(2012)$. Among them, the $\Xi(1820)$ and $\Sigma(1670)$ may exhibit a potential two-pole structures. The unitarized chiral perturbation approach is then applied as the underlying theory to predict the energy levels of these systems in a finite volume. These energy levels are well described by the $K$-matrix parameterization constrained by flavor SU(3) symmetry. With the parameters from the best fits, the poles extracted from the $K$-matrix parameterization closely correspond to those derived from the underlying chiral effective field theory, as long as they are close to physical region and not significantly higher than the lowest relevant threshold.</description>

      <title>The fermion self-energy and damping rate in a hot magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the fermion self-energy in a hot magnetized plasma by using the Landau-level representation. In the one-loop approximation, the Dirac structure of the self-energy is characterized by five different functions that depend on the Landau-level index $n$ and the longitudinal momentum $p_z$. We derive general expressions for all five functions and obtain closed-form expressions for their imaginary parts. The latter receive contributions from three types of on-shell processes, which are interpreted in terms of Landau-level transitions, accompanied by a single photon (gluon) emission or absorption. By making use of the imaginary parts of the self-energy functions, we also derive the Landau-level dependent fermion damping rates $\Gamma_{n}(p_z)$ and study them numerically in a wide range of model parameters. We also demonstrate that the two-spin degeneracy of the Landau levels is lifted by the one-loop self-energy corrections. While the spin splitting of the damping rates is small, it may be important for some spin and chiral effects. We argue that the general method and the numerical results for the rates can have interesting applications in heavy-ion physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, where strongly magnetized QED or QCD plasmas are ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Semiclassics for the QCD vacuum structure through $T^2$-compactification with the baryon-'t Hooft flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study QCD vacuum structure with the topological $\theta$ angle using a recently proposed semiclassical approach on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times T^2$ with the 't Hooft and baryon magnetic fluxes. Under the assumption of adiabatic continuity in this setup, the confining vacuum can be described by the dilute gas of center vortices. With this semiclassical approach, we derive the 2d effective description at small $T^2$ and successfully explain the reasonable theta dependence of the QCD vacuum: In the one-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken for quark mass above a critical value and restored for a subcritical mass, while the $CP$ symmetry is always spontaneously broken in the multi-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$. From our semiclassical description, we discuss implications to the $4$d chiral Lagrangian and propose how the $\eta'$ meson should be incorporated in consistent with known global structures: The periodicity of the $\eta'$ should be extended from the naive one $2\pi$ to $2\pi N$. Additionally, we revisit the phase diagram of $N_f = 1+1$ and $N_f = 1+1+1$ QCD on the up and down quark mass plane, confirming and refining the existence of the $CP$-broken Dashen phase.</description>
