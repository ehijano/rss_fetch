      <title>A Comprehensive Overview of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formalization of real analysis offers a chance to rebuild traditional proofs of important theorems as unambiguous theories that can be interactively explored. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem formalized in the Coq proof assistant, from which the first Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) for the Lebesgue integral is obtained as a corollary. Proving the first FTC in this way has the advantage of decomposing into loosely-coupled theories of moderate size and of independent interest that lend themselves well to incremental and collaborative development. We explain how we formalize all the topological constructs and all the standard lemmas needed to eventually relate the definitions of derivability and of Lebesgue integration of MathComp-Analysis, a formalization of analysis developed on top of the Mathematical Components library. In the course of this experiment, we substantially enrich MathComp-Analysis and even devise a new proof for Urysohn's lemma.</description>

      <title>On Propositional Dynamic Logic and Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic logic in the setting of concurrency has proved problematic because of the challenge of capturing interleaving. This challenge stems from the fact that the operational semantics for programs considered in these logics is tailored on trace reasoning for sequential programs. In this work, we generalise propositional dynamic logic (PDL) to a logic framework we call operational propositional dynamic logic (OPDL) in which we are able to reason on sets of programs provided with arbitrary operational semantics. We prove cut-elimination and adequacy of a sequent calculus for PDL and we extend these results to OPDL. We conclude by discussing OPDL for Milner's CCS and Choreographic Programming.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Wait-Only Non-Blocking Broadcast Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite protocol and communicate synchronously in two different ways: a process can broadcast one message to all other processes or send it to at most one other process. In both cases, if no process can receive the message, it will still be sent. We establish a precise complexity class for two coverability problems with a parameterised number of processes: the state coverability problem and the configuration coverability problem. It is already known that these problems are Ackermann-hard (but decidable) in the general case. We show that when the protocol is Wait-Only, i.e., it has no state from which a process can send and receive messages, the complexity drops to P and PSPACE, respectively.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In formal epistemology, group knowledge is often modelled as the knowledge that the group would have, if the agents shared all their individual knowledge. However, this interpretation does not account for relations between agents. In this work, we propose the notion of synergistic knowledge which makes it possible to model those relationships.</description>

      <title>Formally Modelling the Rijkswaterstaat Tunnel Control Systems in a Constrained Industrial Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rijkswaterstaat, the National Dutch body responsible for infrastructure, recognised the importance of formal modelling and set up a program to model the control of road tunnels. This is done to improve the standardisation of tunnel control and make communication with suppliers smoother. A subset of SysML is used to formulate the models, which are substantial. In an earlier paper we have shown that these models can be used to prove behavioural properties by manually translating the models to mCRL2. In this paper we report on an automatic translation to mCRL2. As the results of the translation became unwieldy, we also investigated modelling tunnel control in the specification language Dezyne which has built-in verification capabilities and compared the results.</description>

      <title>Four Formal Models of IEEE 1394 Link Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the IEEE 1394 high-performance serial bus ("FireWire"), which became a success story in formal methods after three PhD students, by using process algebra and model checking, detected a deadlock error in this IEEE standard. We present four formal models for the asynchronous mode of the Link Layer of IEEE 1394: the original model in muCRL, a simplified model in mCRL2, a revised model in LOTOS, and a novel model in LNT.</description>

      <title>A categorical formulation of Kraus' paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a categorical formulation of Kraus' "magic trick" for recovering information from truncated types. Rather than type theory, we work in Van den Berg-Moerdijk path categories with a univalent universe, and rather than propositional truncation we work with arbitrary cofibrations, which includes truncation as a special case. We show, using Kraus' argument that any cofibration with homogeneous domain is a monomorphism. We give some simple concrete examples in groupoids to illustrate the interaction between homogeneous types, cofibrations and univalent fibrations.</description>

      <title>Preference-Based Planning in Stochastic Environments: From Partially-Ordered Temporal Goals to Most Preferred Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human preferences are not always represented via complete linear orders: It is natural to employ partially-ordered preferences for expressing incomparable outcomes. In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning in stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a partially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals. Specifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially ordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal goals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred policy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most preferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first step, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over temporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which is a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the second step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to computing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed from the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic ordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to illustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing detailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.</description>

      <title>A Path Towards Legal Autonomy: An interoperable and explainable approach to extracting, transforming, loading and computing legal information using large language models, expert systems and Bayesian networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal autonomy - the lawful activity of artificial intelligence agents - can be achieved in one of two ways. It can be achieved either by imposing constraints on AI actors such as developers, deployers and users, and on AI resources such as data, or by imposing constraints on the range and scope of the impact that AI agents can have on the environment. The latter approach involves encoding extant rules concerning AI driven devices into the software of AI agents controlling those devices (e.g., encoding rules about limitations on zones of operations into the agent software of an autonomous drone device). This is a challenge since the effectivity of such an approach requires a method of extracting, loading, transforming and computing legal information that would be both explainable and legally interoperable, and that would enable AI agents to reason about the law. In this paper, we sketch a proof of principle for such a method using large language models (LLMs), expert legal systems known as legal decision paths, and Bayesian networks. We then show how the proposed method could be applied to extant regulation in matters of autonomous cars, such as the California Vehicle Code.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification with Constrained Polynomial Logical Zonotope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose using constrained polynomial logical zonotopes for formal verification of logical systems. We perform reachability analysis to compute the set of states that could be reached. To do this, we utilize a recently introduced set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing computationally efficient and exact reachability analysis on logical systems. Notably, polynomial logical zonotopes address the "curse of dimensionality" when analyzing the reachability of logical systems since the set representation can represent 2^n binary vectors using n generators. After finishing the reachability analysis, the formal verification involves verifying whether the intersection of the calculated reachable set and the unsafe set is empty or not. However, polynomial logical zonotopes are not closed under intersections. To address this, we formulate constrained polynomial logical zonotopes, which maintain the computational efficiency and exactness of polynomial logical zonotopes for reachability analysis while supporting exact intersections. Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical study illustrating and verifying the benefits of using constrained polynomial logical zonotopes for the formal verification of logical systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Formalisation of ISO 34502 Critical Scenarios: Modular Construction with the RSS Safety Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the development of autonomous vehicles progresses, efficient safety assurance methods become increasingly necessary. Safety assurance methods such as monitoring and scenario-based testing call for formalisation of driving scenarios. In this paper, we develop a temporal-logic formalisation of an important class of critical scenarios in the ISO standard 34502. We use signal temporal logic (STL) as a logical formalism. Our formalisation has two main features: 1) modular composition of logical formulas for systematic and comprehensive formalisation (following the compositional methodology of ISO 34502); 2) use of the RSS distance for defining danger. We find our formalisation comes with few parameters to tune thanks to the RSS distance. We experimentally evaluated our formalisation; using its results, we discuss the validity of our formalisation and its stability with respect to the choice of some parameter values.</description>

      <title>Compositional Inductive Invariant Based Verification of Neural Network Controlled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of neural networks into safety-critical systems has shown great potential in recent years. However, the challenge of effectively verifying the safety of Neural Network Controlled Systems (NNCS) persists. This paper introduces a novel approach to NNCS safety verification, leveraging the inductive invariant method. Verifying the inductiveness of a candidate inductive invariant in the context of NNCS is hard because of the scale and nonlinearity of neural networks. Our compositional method makes this verification process manageable by decomposing the inductiveness proof obligation into smaller, more tractable subproblems. Alongside the high-level method, we present an algorithm capable of automatically verifying the inductiveness of given candidates by automatically inferring the necessary decomposition predicates. The algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline method and shows remarkable reductions in execution time in our case studies, shortening the verification time from hours (or timeout) to seconds.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>
