      <title>A high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian Runge-Kutta finite volume (EL-RK-FV) method for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian Runge-Kutta finite volume methods that can numerically solve Burgers' equation with shock formations, which could be extended to general scalar conservation laws. Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) and semi-Lagrangian (SL) methods have recently seen increased development and have become a staple for allowing large time-stepping sizes. Yet, maintaining relatively large time-stepping sizes post shock formation remains quite challenging. Our proposed scheme integrates the partial differential equation on a space-time region partitioned by linear approximations to the characteristics determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition. We trace the characteristics forward in time and present a merging procedure for the mesh cells to handle intersecting characteristics due to shocks. Following this partitioning, we write the equation in a time-differential form and evolve with Runge-Kutta methods in a method-of-lines fashion. High-resolution methods such as ENO and WENO-AO schemes are used for spatial reconstruction. Extension to higher dimensions is done via dimensional splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate our scheme's high-order accuracy and ability to sharply capture post-shock solutions with large time-stepping sizes.</description>

      <title>Low-rank Tree Tensor Network Operators for Long-Range Pairwise Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compactly representing and efficently applying linear operators are fundamental ingredients in tensor network methods for simulating quantum many-body problems and solving high-dimensional problems in scientific computing. In this work, we study such representations for tree tensor networks, the so called tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), paying particular attention to Hamiltonian operators that involve long-range pairwise interactions between particles. Generalizing the work by Lin, Tong, and others on matrix product operators, we establish a direct connection between the hierarchical low-rank structure of the interaction matrix and the TTNO property. This connection allows us to arrive at very compact TTNO representations by compressing the interaction matrix into a hierarchically semi-separable matrix. Numerical experiments for different quantum spin systems validate our results and highlight the potential advantages of TTNOs over matrix product operators.</description>

      <title>Single-ensemble multilevel Monte Carlo for discrete interacting-particle methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve problems in domains such as filtering, optimization, and posterior sampling, interacting-particle methods have recently received much attention. These parallelizable and often gradient-free algorithms use an ensemble of particles that evolve in time, based on a combination of well-chosen dynamics and interaction between the particles. For computationally expensive dynamics -- for example, dynamics that solve inverse problems with an expensive forward model -- the cost of attaining a high accuracy quickly becomes prohibitive. We exploit a hierarchy of approximations to this forward model and apply multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques, improving the asymptotic cost-to-error relation. More specifically, we use MLMC at each time step to estimate the interaction term within a single, globally-coupled ensemble. This technique was proposed by Hoel et al. in the context of the ensemble Kalman filter; the goal of the present paper is to study its applicability to a general framework of interacting-particle methods. After extending the algorithm and its analysis to a broad set of methods with fixed numbers of time steps, we motivate the application of the method to the class of algorithms with an infinite time horizon, which includes popular methods such as ensemble Kalman algorithms for optimization and sampling. Numerical tests confirm the improved asymptotic scaling of the multilevel approach.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Graph Signal Recovery Using High-Order Smoothness and Adaptive Low-rankness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying graph signal recovery has been widely used in many applications, including climate change, environmental hazard monitoring, and epidemic studies. It is crucial to choose appropriate regularizations to describe the characteristics of the underlying signals, such as the smoothness of the signal over the graph domain and the low-rank structure of the spatial-temporal signal modeled in a matrix form. As one of the most popular options, the graph Laplacian is commonly adopted in designing graph regularizations for reconstructing signals defined on a graph from partially observed data. In this work, we propose a time-varying graph signal recovery method based on the high-order Sobolev smoothness and an error-function weighted nuclear norm regularization to enforce the low-rankness. Two efficient algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers and iterative reweighting are proposed, and convergence of one algorithm is shown in detail. We conduct various numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art in graph signal recovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <title>Convergence of kinetic Langevin samplers for non-convex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three kinetic Langevin samplers including the Euler discretization, the BU and the UBU splitting scheme. We provide contraction results in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for non-convex potentials. These results are based on a carefully tailored distance function and an appropriate coupling construction. Additionally, the error in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance between the true target measure and the invariant measure of the discretization scheme is bounded. To get an $\varepsilon$-accuracy in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, we show complexity guarantees of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ for the Euler scheme and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for the UBU scheme under appropriate regularity assumptions on the target measure. The results are applicable to interacting particle systems and provide bounds for sampling probability measures of mean-field type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ of $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ and $OUT$ of $\left|\phi\right\rangle$ based on a set of wavefunction measurements (within a phase) $\psi_l \to \phi_l$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} \left|\langle\phi_l|\mathcal{U}|\psi_l\rangle\right|^2$ subject to probability preservation constraints on $\mathcal{U}$ (partial unitarity). Constructed operator $\mathcal{U}$ can be considered as a $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel; it is a partially unitary rectangular matrix of the dimension $\dim(OUT) \times \dim(IN)$ transforming operators as $A^{OUT}=\mathcal{U} A^{IN} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. An iteration algorithm finding the global maximum of this optimization problem is developed and it's application to a number of problems is demonstrated. A software product implementing the algorithm is available from the authors.</description>

      <title>A $\mu$-mode approach for exponential integrators: actions of $\varphi$-functions of Kronecker sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for computing actions of the exponential-like $\varphi$-functions for a Kronecker sum $K$ of $d$ arbitrary matrices $A_\mu$. It is based on the approximation of the integral representation of the $\varphi$-functions by Gaussian quadrature formulas combined with a scaling and squaring technique. The resulting algorithm, which we call PHIKS, evaluates the required actions by means of $\mu$-mode products involving exponentials of the small sized matrices $A_\mu$, without forming the large sized matrix $K$ itself. PHIKS, which profits from the highly efficient level 3 BLAS, is designed to compute different $\varphi$-functions applied on the same vector or a linear combination of actions of $\varphi$-functions applied on different vectors. In addition, thanks to the underlying scaling and squaring techniques, the desired quantities are available simultaneously at suitable time scales. All these features allow the effective usage of PHIKS in the exponential integration context. In fact, our newly designed method has been tested on popular exponential Runge--Kutta integrators of stiff order from one to four, in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms for computing actions of $\varphi$-functions. The numerical experiments with discretized semilinear evolutionary 2D or 3D advection--diffusion--reaction, Allen--Cahn, and Brusselator equations show the superiority of the proposed $\mu$-mode approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of Gaussian random fields on Closed Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation of Gaussian random fields on closed surfaces defined as the solution to a fractional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with additive white noise. The SPDE involves two parameters controlling the smoothness and the correlation length of the Gaussian random field. The proposed numerical method relies on the Balakrishnan integral representation of the solution and does not require the approximation of eigenpairs. Rather, it consists of a sinc quadrature coupled with a standard surface finite element method. We provide a complete error analysis of the method and illustrate its performances by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Open Source Implementations of Numerical Algorithms for Computing the Complete Elliptic Integral of the First Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1) plays in a significant role in mathematics, physics and engineering. There is no simple formula for its computation, thus numerical algorithms are essential for coping with practical problems involved. The commercial implementations for the numerical solutions, such as the functions ellipticK and EllipticK provided by MATLAB and Mathematica respectively, are based on $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{cs}}(m)$ instead of the usual form $K(k)$ such that $m = k^2$ and $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{cs}}(k^2) = K(k)$. It is necessary to develop open source implementations for the computation of the CEI-1 in order to avoid potential risks of using commercial software and possible limitations due to the unknown factors. In this paper, the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss-Chebyshev method and Gauss-Legendre methods are discussed in details with a top-down strategy. The four key algorithms for computing CEI-1 are designed, verified, validated and tested, which can be utilized in R\&amp; D and be reused properly. Numerical results show that our open source implementations based on $K(k)$ are equivalent to the commercial implementation based on $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{cs}}(m)$. The general algorithms for computing orthogonal polynomials developed are significant byproducts in the sense of STEM education and scientific computation.</description>

      <title>Particle method and quantization-based schemes for the simulation of the McKean-Vlasov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three numerical schemes for the McKean-Vlasov equation \[\begin{cases} \;dX_t=b(t, X_t, \mu_t) \, dt+\sigma(t, X_t, \mu_t) \, dB_t,\: \\ \;\forall\, t\in[0,T],\;\mu_t \text{ is the probability distribution of }X_t, \end{cases}\] where $X_0$ is a known random variable. Under the assumption on the Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients $b$ and $\sigma$, our first result proves the convergence rate of the particle method with respect to the Wasserstein distance, which extends a previous work [BT97] established in one-dimensional setting. In the second part, we present and analyse two quantization-based schemes, including the recursive quantization scheme (deterministic scheme) in the Vlasov setting, and the hybrid particle-quantization scheme (random scheme, inspired by the $K$-means clustering). Two examples are simulated at the end of this paper: Burger's equation and the network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Randomly sampling bipartite networks with fixed degree sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04937v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of bipartite networks frequently requires randomly sampling from the set of all bipartite networks with the same degree sequence as an observed network. Trade algorithms offer an efficient way to generate samples of bipartite networks by incrementally `trading' the positions of some of their edges. However, it is difficult to know how many such trades are required to ensure that the sample is random. I propose a stopping rule that focuses on the distance between sampled networks and the observed network, and stops performing trades when this distribution stabilizes. Analyses demonstrate that, for over 650 different degree sequences, using this stopping rule ensures a random sample with a high probability, and that it is practical for use in empirical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems with homogeneous essential boundary conditions where the coefficients (and hence the solution $u$) may depend on a parameter $y$. For the efficient approximate evaluation of parameter sensitivities of the first eigenpairs on the entire parameter space we propose and analyse Gevrey class and analytic regularity of the solution with respect to the parameters. This is made possible by a novel proof technique which we introduce and demonstrate in this paper. Our regularity result has immediate implications for convergence of various numerical schemes for parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems, in particular, for elliptic eigenvalue problems with infinitely many parameters arising from elliptic differential operators with random coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximal regularity is a kind of a priori estimates for parabolic-type equations and it plays an important role in the theory of nonlinear differential equations. The aim of this paper is to investigate the temporally discrete counterpart of maximal regularity for the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time-stepping method. We will establish such an estimate without logarithmic factor over a quasi-uniform temporal mesh. To show the main result, we introduce the temporally regularized Green's function and then reduce the discrete maximal regularity to a weighted error estimate for its DG approximation. Our results would be useful for investigation of DG approximation of nonlinear parabolic problems.</description>

      <title>Denoising of Sphere- and SO(3)-Valued Data by Relaxed Tikhonov Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifold-valued signal- and image processing has received attention due to modern image acquisition techniques. Recently, a convex relaxation of the otherwise nonconvex Tikhonov-regularization for denoising circle-valued data has been proposed by Condat (2022). The circle constraints are here encoded in a series of low-dimensional, positive semi-definite matrices. Using Schur complement arguments, we show that the resulting variational model can be simplified while leading to the same solution. The simplified model can be generalized to higher dimensional spheres and to SO(3)-valued data, where we rely on the quaternion representation of the latter. Standard algorithms from convex analysis can be applied to solve the resulting convex minimization problem. As proof-of-the-concept, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers to demonstrate the denoising behavior of the proposed method. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the numerical convergence of the signal- or image values to the underlying manifold.</description>

In particular, we consider derivative-based sensitivity analysis of the information gain, as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the posterior to the prior distribution. To facilitate this, we develop a fast and accurate method for computing derivatives of the information gain with respect to auxiliary model parameters. Our approach combines low-rank approximations, adjoint-based eigenvalue sensitivity analysis, and post-optimal sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach also paves way for global sensitivity analysis by computing derivative-based global sensitivity measures. We illustrate different aspects of the proposed approach using an inverse problem governed by a scalar linear elliptic PDE, and an inverse problem governed by the three-dimensional equations of linear elasticity, which is motivated by the inversion of the fault-slip field after an earthquake.</description>

      <title>Stability estimates of Nystr\"om discretizations of Helmholtz decomposition boundary integral equation formulations for the solution of Navier scattering problems in two dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>

Abstract: Helmholtz decompositions of elastic fields is a common approach for the solution of Navier scattering problems. Used in the context of Boundary Integral Equations (BIE), this approach affords solutions of Navier problems via the simpler Helmholtz boundary integral operators (BIOs). Approximations of Helmholtz Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) can be employed within a regularizing combined field strategy to deliver BIE formulations of the second kind for the solution of Navier scattering problems in two dimensions with Dirichlet boundary conditions, at least in the case of smooth boundaries. Unlike the case of scattering and transmission Helmholtz problems, the approximations of the DtN maps we use in the Helmholtz decomposition BIE in the Navier case require incorporation of lower order terms in their pseudodifferential asymptotic expansions. The presence of these lower order terms in the Navier regularized BIE formulations complicates the stability analysis of their Nystr\"om discretizations in the framework of global trigonometric interpolation and the Kussmaul-Martensen kernel singularity splitting strategy. The main difficulty stems from compositions of pseudodifferential operators of opposite orders, whose Nystr\"om discretization must be performed with care via pseudodifferential expansions beyond the principal symbol. The error analysis is significantly simpler in the case of arclength boundary parametrizations and considerably more involved in the case of general smooth parametrizations which are typically encountered in the description of one dimensional closed curves.</description>

      <title>Solving Fredholm Integral Equations of the First Kind via Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Fredholm equations of the first kind is crucial in many areas of the applied sciences. In this work we adopt a probabilistic and variational point of view by considering a minimization problem in the space of probability measures with an entropic regularization. Contrary to classical approaches which discretize the domain of the solutions, we introduce an algorithm to asymptotically sample from the unique solution of the regularized minimization problem. As a result our estimators do not depend on any underlying grid and have better scalability properties than most existing methods. Our algorithm is based on a particle approximation of the solution of a McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation associated with the Wasserstein gradient flow of our variational formulation. We prove the convergence towards a minimizer and provide practical guidelines for its numerical implementation. Finally, our method is compared with other approaches on several examples including density deconvolution and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Framework for Global Non-Convex Polynomial Optimization over the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel efficient theoretical and numerical framework for solving global non-convex polynomial optimization problems. We analytically demonstrate that such problems can be efficiently reformulated using a non-linear objective over a convex set; further, these reformulated problems possess no spurious local minima (i.e., every local minimum is a global minimum). We introduce an algorithm for solving these resulting problems using the augmented Lagrangian and the method of Burer and Monteiro. We show through numerical experiments that polynomial scaling in dimension and degree is achievable for computing the optimal value and location of previously intractable global polynomial optimization problems in high dimension.</description>
