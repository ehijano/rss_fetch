      <title>An uncertainty-aware physics-informed neural network solution for the Black-Scholes equation: a novel framework for option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed neural network (PINN) for option pricing that solves the Black--Scholes (BS) partial differential equation (PDE) as a mesh-free, global surrogate over $(S,t)$. The model embeds the BS operator and boundary/terminal conditions in a residual-based objective and requires no labeled prices. For American options, early exercise is handled via an obstacle-style relaxation while retaining the BS residual in the continuation region. To quantify \emph{epistemic} uncertainty, we introduce an anchored-ensemble fine-tuning stage (AT--PINN) that regularizes each model toward a sampled anchor and yields prediction bands alongside point estimates. On European calls/puts, the approach attains low errors (e.g., MAE $\sim 5\times10^{-2}$, RMSE $\sim 7\times10^{-2}$, explained variance $\approx 0.999$ in representative settings) and tracks ground truth closely across strikes and maturities. For American puts, the method remains accurate (MAE/RMSE on the order of $10^{-1}$ with EV $\approx 0.999$) and does not exhibit the error accumulation associated with time-marching schemes. Against data-driven baselines (ANN, RNN) and a Kolmogorov--Arnold FINN variant (KAN), our PINN matches or outperforms on accuracy while training more stably; anchored ensembles provide uncertainty bands that align with observed error scales. We discuss design choices (loss balancing, sampling near the payoff kink), limitations, and extensions to higher-dimensional BS settings and alternative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning a family of solutions to an optimal pension investment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a neural network to identify the optimal solution to a family of optimal investment problems, where the parameters determining an investor's risk and consumption preferences are given as inputs to the neural network in addition to economic variables. This is used to develop a practical tool that can be used to explore how pension outcomes vary with preference parameters. We use a Black-Scholes economic model so that we may validate the accuracy of network using a classical and provably convergent numerical method developed using the duality approach.</description>

      <title>Push-response anomalies in high-frequency S&amp;P 500 price series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis that consecutive intraday price changes in the most liquid U.S. equity ETF (SPY) are conditionally nonrandom. Using NBBO event-time data for about 1,500 regular trading days, we form for every lag L ordered pairs of a backward price increment ("push") and a forward price increment ("response"), standardize them, and estimate the expected responses on a fine grid of push magnitudes. The resulting lag-by-magnitude maps reveal a persistent structural shift: for short lags (1-5,000 ticks), expected responses cluster near zero across most push magnitudes, suggesting high short-term efficiency; beyond that range, pronounced tails emerge, indicating that larger historical pushes increasingly correlate with nonzero conditional responses. We also find that large negative pushes are followed by stronger positive responses than equally large positive pushes, consistent with asymmetric liquidity replenishment after sell-side shocks. Decomposition into symmetric and antisymmetric components and the associated dominance curves confirm that short-horizon efficiency is restored only partially. The evidence points to an intraday, lag-resolved anomaly that is invisible in unconditional returns and that can be used to define tradable pockets and risk controls.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Neutral Neural Operator for Arbitrage-Free SPX-VIX Term Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Operator Learning for Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep neural-operator framework for a general class of probability models. Under global Lipschitz conditions on the operator over the entire Euclidean space-and for a broad class of probabilistic models-we establish a universal approximation theorem with explicit network-size bounds for the proposed architecture. The underlying stochastic processes are required only to satisfy integrability and general tail-probability conditions. We verify these assumptions for both European and American option-pricing problems within the forward-backward SDE (FBSDE) framework, which in turn covers a broad class of operators arising from parabolic PDEs, with or without free boundaries. Finally, we present a numerical example for a basket of American options, demonstrating that the learned model produces optimal stopping boundaries for new strike prices without retraining.</description>

      <title>A Novel Loss Function for Deep Learning Based Daily Stock Trading System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making consistently profitable financial decisions in a continuously evolving and volatile stock market has always been a difficult task. Professionals from different disciplines have developed foundational theories to anticipate price movement and evaluate securities such as the famed Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In recent years, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in asset pricing has been growing. Although the black-box nature of deep learning models lacks interpretability, they have continued to solidify their position in the financial industry. We aim to further enhance AI's potential and utility by introducing a return-weighted loss function that will drive top growth while providing the ML models a limited amount of information. Using only publicly accessible stock data (open/close/high/low, trading volume, sector information) and several technical indicators constructed from them, we propose an efficient daily trading system that detects top growth opportunities. Our best models achieve 61.73\% annual return on daily rebalancing with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 1.18 over 1340 testing days from 2019 to 2024, and 37.61\% annual return with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.97 over 1360 testing days from 2005 to 2010. The main drivers for success, especially independent of any domain knowledge, are the novel return-weighted loss function, the integration of categorical and continuous data, and the ML model architecture. We also demonstrate the superiority of our novel loss function over traditional loss functions via several performance metrics and statistical evidence.</description>
