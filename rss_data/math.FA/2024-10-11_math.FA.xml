      <title>New tools for the study of Bochner differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence $\{\delta_n^{(k)}\}$ associated to a Bochner differential operator is introduced as an effective tool to study this kind of operators. Some properties of this sequence are proven and used to deduce that a particular operator leads to solutions of a bispectral problem. In addition, the inverse problem is studied; that is, given a sequence
  $\{\lambda_n\}$ of complex numbers and a sequence
  $\{P_n\}$ of polynomials with complex coefficients,
  $\deg{P_n}=n$, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a Bochner differential operator that has those sequences as eigenvalues and eigenpolynomials, respectively. The mentioned condition also depends on
  $\{\delta_n^{(k)}\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hausdorff operator $\mathcal{H}_\mu$ on a large class of weighted mixed norm Fock spaces $F_\phi^{p,q}$ for $1\leq p,q\leq\infty$. The boundedness and compactness of $\mathcal{H}_\mu$ on $F_\phi^{p,q}$ are characterized. As applications, we give when Hausdorff operator on $F_\phi^{p,q}$ is power bounded or uniformly mean ergodic.</description>

      <title>Potential theory and boundary behavior in the Drury-Arveson space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a notion of capacity for the Drury-Arveson space $H^2_d$ of holomorphic functions on the Euclidean unit ball. We show that every function in $H^2_d$ has a non-tangential limit (in fact Kor\'anyi limit) at every point in the sphere outside of a set of capacity zero. Moreover, we prove that the capacity zero condition is sharp, and that it is equivalent to being totally null for $H^2_d$. We also provide applications to cyclicity. Finally, we discuss generalizations of these results to other function spaces on the ball.</description>

      <title>Additive mappings preserving orthogonality between complex inner product spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ and $K$ be two complex inner product spaces with dim$(X)\geq 2$. We prove that for each non-zero additive mapping $A:H \to K$ the following statements are equivalent:
  $(a)$ $A$ is (complex) linear or conjugate-linear mapping and there exists $\gamma &gt;0$ such that $\| A (x) \| = \gamma \|x\|$, for all $x\in X$, that is, $A$ is a positive scalar multiple of a linear or a conjugate-linear isometry;
  $(b)$ There exists $\gamma_1 &gt;0$ such that one of the next properties holds for all $x,y \in H$:
  $(b.1)$ $\langle A(x) |A(y)\rangle = \gamma_1 \langle x|y\rangle,$
  $(b.2)$ $\langle A(x) |A(y)\rangle = \gamma_1 \langle y|x \rangle;$
  $(c)$ $A$ is linear or conjugate-linear and preserves orthogonality in both directions;
  $(d)$ $A$ is linear or conjugate-linear and preserves orthogonality;
  $(e)$ $A$ is additive and preserves orthogonality in both directions;
  $(f)$ $A$ is additive and preserves orthogonality.
  This extends to the complex setting a recent generalization of the Koldobsky--Blanco--Turn\v{s}ek theorem obtained by W\'ojcik for real normed spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum law of large numbers for Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\ell_p, \ell_p)$ for some $1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty$. The law of large numbers is known in the case $p=2$ in the form of usual law of large numbers. Instead of sum of i.i.d. variables there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$. We obtain the law of large numbers for the case $p \leqslant 2$.</description>

      <title>On difference Riccati equation and continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a difference Riccati equation $\Phi(x) + \rho(x)/\Phi(x-\omega) = v(x)$ with $1-$periodic continuos coefficients. Using continued fraction theory we investigate a problem of existence of continuos solutions for this equation. It is shown that convergence of a continued fraction representing a solution of the Riccati equation can be expressed in terms of hyperbolicity of a cocycle naturally associated to this continued fraction. We apply the critical set method to establish the uniform hyperbolicity of the cocycle and to obtain sufficient conditions for the convergence of a continued fraction giving a representation for a solution of the Riccati equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\ell^r$-valued extensions of linear operators defined on Lebesgue spaces with variable exponent. Under some natural (and usual) conditions on the exponents, we characterize $1\leq r\leq \infty$ such that every bounded linear operator $T\colon L^{q(\cdot)}(\Omega_2, \mu)\to L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega_1, \nu)$ has a bounded $\ell^r$-valued extension. We consider both non-atomic measures and measures with atoms and show the differences that can arise. We present some applications of our results to weighted norm inequalities of linear operators and vector-valued extensions of fractional operators with rough kernel.</description>

      <title>Measure-operator convolutions and applications to mixed-state Gabor multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Weyl-Heisenberg group, convolutions between functions and operators were defined by Werner as a part of a framework called quantum harmonic analysis. We show how recent results by Feichtinger can be used to extend this definition to include convolutions between measures and operators. Many properties of function-operator convolutions carry over to this setting and allow us to prove novel results on the distribution of eigenvalues of mixed-state Gabor multipliers and derive a version of the Berezin-Lieb inequality for lattices. New results on the continuity of Gabor multipliers with respect to lattice parameters, masks and windows as well as their ability to approximate localization operators are also derived using this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic variational method for functionals depending on eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds. It is based on a new concept of Palais Smale sequences that can be constructed thanks to a generalization of classical min-max methods on $C^1$ functionals to locally-Lipschitz functionals. We prove convergence results on these Palais-Smale sequences emerging from combinations of Laplace eigenvalues or combinations of Steklov eigenvalues in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory, Computing, and Deep Learning on the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19548v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of approximating functions in infinite-dimensional spaces from finite samples is widely regarded as formidable. We delve into the challenging problem of the numerical approximation of Sobolev-smooth functions defined on probability spaces. Our particular focus centers on the Wasserstein distance function, which serves as a relevant example. In contrast to the existing body of literature focused on approximating efficiently pointwise evaluations, we chart a new course to define functional approximants by adopting three machine learning-based approaches: 1. Solving a finite number of optimal transport problems and computing the corresponding Wasserstein potentials. 2. Employing empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization in Wasserstein Sobolev spaces. 3. Addressing the problem through the saddle point formulation that characterizes the weak form of the Tikhonov functional's Euler-Lagrange equation. We furnish explicit and quantitative bounds on generalization errors for each of these solutions. We leverage the theory of metric Sobolev spaces and we combine it with techniques of optimal transport, variational calculus, and large deviation bounds. In our numerical implementation, we harness appropriately designed neural networks to serve as basis functions. These networks undergo training using diverse methodologies. This approach allows us to obtain approximating functions that can be rapidly evaluated after training. Our constructive solutions significantly enhance at equal accuracy the evaluation speed, surpassing that of state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitude. This allows evaluations over large datasets several times faster, including training, than traditional optimal transport algorithms. Our analytically designed deep learning architecture slightly outperforms the test error of state-of-the-art CNN architectures on datasets of images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smocked spaces are a class of metric spaces which were introduced to generalise pulled thread spaces. We investigate convergence of these spaces, showing that the smocked space obtained from the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of smocking sets is equivalent to the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the corresponding smocked spaces. We prove that it is sufficient to have uniform bounds on the smocking constants in order to have a sequence of smocked spaces with a Gromov-Hausdorff converging subsequence. We also show that given a normed space, there exists a smocked space whose unique tangent cone at infinity is that space. This answers three open questions of Sormani et al. We finish with some remarks on possible applications to metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>
