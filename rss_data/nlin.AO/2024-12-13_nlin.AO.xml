      <title>Dynamics of swarmalators in the presence of a contrarian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarmalators are entities that combine the swarming behavior of particles with the oscillatory dynamics of coupled phase oscillators and represent a novel and rich area of study within the field of complex systems. Unlike traditional models that treat spatial movement and phase synchronization separately, swarmalators exhibit a unique coupling between their positions and internal phases, leading to emergent behaviors that include clustering, pattern formation, and the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states etc. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a two-dimensional swarmalator model in the presence of a predator-like agent that we call a contrarian. The positions and the phases of the swarmalators are influenced by the contrarian and we observe the emergence of intriguing collective states. We find that swarmalator phases are synchronized even with negative coupling strength when their interaction with the contrarian is comparatively strong. Through a combination of analytical methods and simulations, we demonstrate how varying these parameters can lead to transitions between different collective states.</description>

      <title>Towards the Structure and Mechanisms of Complex Systems, the Approach of the Quantitative Theory of Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analysis of complex systems using a Quantitative Theory of Meaning developed as an extention of Shannon's Communication Theory. The approach consideres complexity not in terms of the manifestation of its effects which are manifestation of the dynamics of the system, but in terms of primary causes and taking into account the topology of the system. Here, the dynamics of the system are provided by reflexive communication between heterogenious agents that make up the system. Unlike Shannon's Communication Theory the Theory of Meaning imposes restrictions on the complex systems being analyzed. Non-linearity and specific dynamics of the system arise as a consequence of the topology of the system. This topology also suggests a method for analyzing complex systems, the logistic Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The paper also lays the foundation for future research in various fields studying complex systems of interacting geterogeneous agents, which may form a new paradigm for better understanding the structure, mechanisms, and dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>An exact solution for a non-autonomous delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for a simple non-autonomous delay differential equation (DDE) over the entire real-time axis, representing it as a sum of Gaussian-shaped dynamics with distinct peak positions. This marks the first explicit solution for non-autonomous DDEs and is a rare example even among general DDEs. The constructed solution offers key physical insights and facilitates the analysis of system properties, such as the envelope profile of the dynamics.</description>
