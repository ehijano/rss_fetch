      <title>A Coarsening Approach to the Troll Aquifer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective management of pressure communication and interference between concurrent CO$_2$ storage operations is essential for the development of gigaton-scale storage hubs. Coarse models in reservoir simulation offer a simplified representation of the subsurface to efficiently predict pressure distribution. By averaging properties over larger grid blocks, coarsened models significantly reduce computational demands, enabling faster and more manageable simulations. The approach focuses on preserving key physical properties, namely cell connectivity (transmissibilities) and storage capacity (pore volumes). The effectiveness of the coarsened model is demonstrated by applying the improved well location derived from the coarsened model to the full-resolution Troll aquifer model, resulting in improved pressure distribution. The coarsened model enabled the execution of approximately 100,000 simulations over five days using a local server with 144 CPUs, an effort that would have required around seven months using the original model. The coarsening methodology is implemented using pycopm, an open-source tool design to tailor geological models based on industry-standard grid formats, facilitating its application to other models and applications in reservoir engineering.</description>

      <title>Do Earthquakes Wake More Slopes Than They Calm?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong earthquakes can have a dual impact on the slow-moving landslide budget of a landscape by either triggering new actively deforming hillslopes or stabilizing existing ones. However, their regional-scale influence on hillslope processes remains poorly understood due to limited observational coverage and the masking effects of long-wavelength post-seismic signals. This knowledge gap constrains our ability to assess post-seismic landslide hazards, particularly since actively deforming hillslopes may evolve into rapid failures, especially under the influence of meteorological factors following a major earthquake. This study addresses this gap by analyzing slope instability across approximately 66,800sq.km of southeastern T\"urkiye in the aftermath of the February 6, 2023, Kahramanmara\c{s} earthquake sequence. We used Sentinel-1 InSAR time series spanning three years before and one year after the earthquakes and applied a convolution-based filtering method to isolate localized surface deformation from broader tectonic signals. Given the challenge of validating deformation anomalies at a regional scale without in-situ measurements, we cross-checked these locations using high-resolution optical imagery and assigned confidence levels based on observable surface features indicative of slow-moving landslides. The resulting inventories were further enriched by expert-based assessments. Our results show that the total area affected by slow-moving landslides increased from 12.36sq.km to 159.38sq.km, reflecting a more than 12-fold rise. While a substantial number of slopes were newly activated (348), others became stabilized (28) or shifted to different deformation states (20). These findings highlight the complex response of hillslopes to seismic forcing and emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring to capture the full spectrum of earthquake-induced landslide behavior.</description>

      <title>Economy and Geography Shape the Collective Attention of Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are commonly used to explore human behavior. However, previous studies largely overlooked the geographical and economic factors embedded in collective attention. To address this, we construct attention networks from time-series data for the United States and China, each a key economic power in the West and the East, respectively. We reveal a strong macroscale correlation between urban attention and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). At the mesoscale, community detection of attention networks shows that high-GDP cities consistently act as core nodes within their communities and occupy strategic geographic positions. At the microscale, structural hole theory identifies these cities as key connectors between communities, with influence proportional to economic output. Overlapping community detection further reveals tightly connected urban clusters, prompting us to introduce geographic and topic-based metrics, which show that closely linked cities are spatially proximate and topically coherent. Of course, not all patterns were consistent across regions. A notable distinction emerged in the relationship between population size and urban attention, which was evident in the United States but absent in China. Building on these insights, we integrate key variables reflecting GDP, geography, and scenic resources into regression model to cross-verify the influence of economic and geographic factors on collective user attention, and unexpectedly discover that a composite index of population, access, and scenery fails to account for cross-city variations in attention. Our study bridges the gap between economic prosperity and geographic centrality in shaping urban attention landscapes.</description>
