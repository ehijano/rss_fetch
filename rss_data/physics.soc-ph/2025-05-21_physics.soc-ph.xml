      <title>PANDAVA: Semantic and Reflexive Protocol for Interdisciplinary and Cognitive Knowledge Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern science faces the need to move from linear systematic review protocols to deeper cognitive navigation across fields of knowledge. In this context, the PANDAVA protocol (Protocol for Analysis and Navigation of Deep Argumentative and Valued Knowledge) is designed for analysing the semantic structures of scientific knowledge. It combines semantic mapping, assessment of concept maturity, clustering, and generation of new hypotheses. PANDAVA is interpreted as the first interdisciplinary protocol for knowledge systematization focused on semantic and cognitive mapping. The PANDAVA protocol integrates quantitative analysis methods with reflective procedures for comprehending the structure of knowledge and is applied in interdisciplinary, theoretically saturated fields where traditional models such as PRISMA prove insufficient. As an example, the protocol was applied to analyse the abiogenesis hypotheses. Modelling demonstrated how to structure theories of the origin of life through the integration of data on microlight, turbulent processes, and geochemical sources. PANDAVA enables researchers to identify strong and weak concepts, construct knowledge maps, and develop new hypotheses. Overall, PANDAVA represents a cognitively enriched tool for meaningful knowledge management, fostering the transition from the representation of facts to the design of new scientific paradigms.</description>

      <title>The Problematic Hoover Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hoover index H, derived from the distribution of population density, has a long history in population geography. But it is prone to misinterpretation and serious measurement artifacts, some of which have been recognized for years. Here its problems, old and new, are put in a common framework and quantitatively dissected with thought-experiments, experimental reaggregation over a thousand-fold range, modeling, and simulation. H has long been interpreted as urbanization, which simple examples show is incorrect. Values of H near zero are taken as an ideal or primordial state, but the mechanism and distributions of settlement growth show that H can be expected in the range 0.4-0.7 and remain nearly constant across continents, centuries of time, and wide ranges of population density. Technically, the measurement of H is confounded by choices of aggregation scale, inclusion of unpopulated areas, and truncated input data, which produce wide swings in its value. Spatially isotropic modeling and simulation reproduce its trends with aggregation scale and time, nullifying many frontier- or nation-specific interpretations. I suggest methods to recognize and address its major artifacts and point out several trends with valid interpretations.</description>

      <title>LLMs Capture Urban Science but Oversimplify Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific reasoning and data generation tasks, yet their alignment with empirical and theoretical structures in urban science remains unclear. Here, this study introduces AI4US (Artificial Intelligence for Urban Science), a framework to systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, and ChatGLM) by generating urban data and testing its fidelity against empirical distributions and three foundational theories: urban scaling laws, urban distance decay, and urban vitality. LLMs reproduce core theoretical patterns with notable accuracy (average R2 = 0.804 for scaling; 0.988 for decay), and exhibit preliminary capacity to simulate less formalized constructs such as urban vitality. However, generated data exhibit crucial limitations: poor diversity and idealization compared to real data; systematic deviations in fitted theoretical parameters (e.g., underestimated scaling exponents and decay rates); and limited improvement from prompt engineering. These findings suggest that while LLMs offer a promising tool for theory-informed urban analysis, they fall short of capturing real-world complexity, underscoring the need for improved alignment and evaluation.</description>

      <title>On the definition and importance of interpretability in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.</description>

      <title>To Be a Truster or Not to Be: Evolutionary Dynamics of a Symmetric N-Player Trust Game in Well-Mixed and Networked Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and other interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts for interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e., investor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been restricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a symmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles, and the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles and drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies are harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with the Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to evolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in the case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations, nonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same nonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the nature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of considering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the emergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a voter model with an evolving number of opinion states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.</description>

      <title>Drivers and barriers to integrating shared micromobility with public transport: a latent class clustering analysis of adoption attitudes in the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared micromobility (SMM), including bicycles, e-bikes, scooters, etc., is often cited as a solution to the first and especially the last mile problem of public transport (PT), yet when implemented, they often do not get adopted by a broader travelling public. As behavioural adaption is largely related to peoples' attitudes and perceptions, we develop a behavioural framework based on the UTAUT2 framework to gain better understanding why individuals may (not) be willing to use SMM. Through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a latent class cluster analysis (LCCA), we study the adoption potential of SMM and assess drivers and barriers as perceived by different user groups. Our findings uncover six user groups; Shared mobility positives, Car-oriented sharing neutrals, Older apprehensive sharers, Young eager adopters, (Shared) Mobility avoiders and Skilled sharing sceptics. The Young eager adopters and Shared mobility positives tend to be the most open to adopting SMM and able to do so. Older apprehensive sharers would like to, but find it difficult or dangerous to use, while Skilled sharing sceptics are capable and confident, but have limited intention of using it. Car-oriented sharing neutrals and (Shared) Mobility avoiders are most negative about SMM, finding it difficult to use and dangerous. Factors relating to technological savviness, ease-of-use, physical safety and societal perception seem to be the strongest adoption predictors. Younger, high-educated males are the group most likely and open to using SMM, while older individuals with lower incomes and a lower level of education tend to be the least likely.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Large-Scale Electric Power Grids with Adaptive Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of AC power grids relies on ancillary services that mitigate frequency fluctuations. The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.</description>
