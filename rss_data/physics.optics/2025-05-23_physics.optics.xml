      <title>Accurate Angle-Resolved Raman Spectroscopy Methodology: Quantifying the Dichroic Edge Filter Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy (ARRS) is an effective method to analyze the symmetry of phonons and other excitations in molecules and solid-state crystals. While there are several configurations of ARRS instruments, the measurement system detailed here utilizes two pairs of linear polarizers and superachromatic half-wave plates. After the orientations of the linear polarizers are set to fixed angles, the two half-wave plates rotate independently, through motorized control, enabling 2D linear polarization mapping. Described within is a protocol to achieve high quality ARRS measurements leveraging phonons from easily accessible test materials [molybdenum disulfide (MoS_2), sapphire (Al_2O_3) and silicon] to validate the system and operation. Quantitative polarized Raman data strongly depends on the quality of sample surface and the optics: the order of placement, alignment, and any distortion caused by their coatings. This study identifies the impact of commonly used edge filters on the polarization response of materials with an anisotropic response as emulated by the T_2g phonon in the Si(100). We detect and model the significant distortion of the T_2g phonon polarization response originating from our dichroic edge filters, the results of which are broadly applicable to optics in any Raman instrument. This ARRS setup also enables helicity-resolved Raman measurements by replacing the first half-wave plate with a superachromatic quarter-wave plate; this configuration is also validated using the Raman response of the aforementioned test materials. This paper aims to increase the quality and reproducibility of polarized Raman measurements through both instrumental considerations and methodology.</description>

      <title>Rapid adiabatic couplers with arbitrary split ratios for broadband DWDM interleaver application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a compact and broadband rapid adiabatic couplers (RACs) with arbitrary power split ratios, achieved through the combination of translational offset and waveguide width control. Fabricated RACs of four different target split ratios show power splitting within $\pm$3% of the design target over a 160 nm wavelength range. Using these RACs, we implement an 8-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) interleaver exhibiting &lt; -20 dB crosstalk for the center 8 channels with flat-top passbands. Over a broader wavelength range, the design maintains crosstalk below -10 dB across more than 40 channels with 100 GHz spacing, demonstrating the broadband capability and scalability of RAC-based photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Single-shot 3D characterization the spatiotemporal optical vortex via a spatiotemporal wavefront sensor (STWFS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of spatiotemporal wave packets (STWPs), represented by spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), has paved the way for the exploration in optics and photonics. To date, despite considerable efforts, a comprehensive and efficient practical means to characterizing wave packets with such complex structures is still lacking. In this study, we introduced a new method designed to achieve high-precision and high-throughput spatiotemporal wave packet measurements using a user-friendly set up. This method is based on a quadriwave lateral shearing interferometric wavefront sensor that utilizes wavelength division multiplexing, termed the "spatiotemporal wavefront sensor (STWFS)." Using this method, we have fabricated a compact prototype with 295 * 295 spatial pixels * 36 wavelength channels of 0.5 nm spectral resolution in a single frame. This STWFS enabled, for the first time, single-shot self-referenced spatiotemporal three-dimensional (3D) optical field characterizations of STOV pulses with transverse orbital angular momenta L of 1 and 2, and obtained the dynamic visualization of the focused propagation of STOV pulses. Furthermore, the STWFS provides a 1.87 nm (0.95%) root mean square (RMS) absolute accuracy for spatiotemporal phase reconstruction. This achievement represents the highest performance compared with other three-dimensional spatiotemporal metrology methods. As a spatiotemporal optical field characterization method, the STWFS offers ultrafast 3D diagnostics, contributing to spatiotemporal photonics and broader applications across different fields, such as light-matter interactions and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Parallel Phase-shifting Digital Ghost Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ghost imaging (GI) technique, which has attracted attention as a highly sensitive and noise-resistant technique, employs a spatially modulated illuminating light and a single-pixel detector. Generally, the information acquired by GI is the transmittance or reflectance distribution of an object. A method has also been proposed to measure the complex amplitude by applying digital holography (DH) techniques. These methods irradiate phase-modulated illuminating lights onto an object, and the intensities of the interference lights between the lights interacting with the object and the reference light are measured. Then, the complex amplitude of the object light is reconstructed based on the correlation between the light intensities and the phase patterns. In DH-based GI, it is necessary to remove unwanted components from the interferogram by phase shifting, which requires more measurements than the conventional GI method. Thus, we propose a technique to reconstruct the complex amplitude in DH-based GI without increasing the number of measurements using parallel phase-shifting optics. In the proposed method, interferograms phase-shifted in steps of $\pi/2$ with waveplates are divided into four using polarization beam splitters (PBS), and their intensities are measured simultaneously. The object light component can be extracted from the intensities of these four interferograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Polarization Matrix Approach to Near-Field Optical Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For paraxial light beams and electromagnetic fields, the Stokes vector and polarization matrix provide equivalent scalar measures of optical chirality, widely used in linear optics. However, growing interest in non-paraxial fields, with fully three-dimensional polarization components, necessitates an extended framework. Here, we develop a general theory for characterizing optical chirality in arbitrary electromagnetic fields, formulated through extensions of the polarization matrix approach. This framework applies to both near- and far-field optical helicity and chirality. As examples, we demonstrate its relevance to near-zone fields from chiral dipole emission and the focal plane of tightly focused beams.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Control via Dynamic Complex Pole-Zero Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise optical phase control is crucial for innovations in telecommunications, optical computing, quantum information processing, and advanced sensing. However, conventional phase modulators often introduce parasitic amplitude modulation and struggle to provide a full 2{\pi} phase shift efficiently. This work introduces a novel paradigm for complete and robust phase control at constant amplitude by dynamically engineering the pole-zero constellation of resonant photonic systems within the complex frequency plane. We theoretically elucidate and validate two distinct approaches: first, by modulating the complex frequency of an excitation signal to trace an iso-amplitude contour (apollonian circle) around a static reflection zero; and second, by dynamically tuning the physical parameters of the resonator such that its reflection zero encircles a fixed-frequency monochromatic excitation, again constraining operation to an iso-amplitude trajectory. Both methods demonstrate the ability to impart a full 2{\pi} phase shift while maintaining a pre-defined, constant reflection amplitude, thereby eliminating amplitude-to-phase distortion. These results leverage the topological nature of phase accumulation around critical points (poles and zeros), a concept gaining significant traction in non-Hermitian and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum interferometry at the nanometer and attosecond scales with energy-entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical optical interferometry, loss and background complicate achieving fast nanometer-resolution measurements with illumination at low light levels. Conversely, quantum two-photon interference is unaffected by loss and background, but nanometer-scale resolution is physically difficult to realize. As a solution, we enhance two-photon interference with highly non-degenerate energy entanglement featuring photon frequencies separated by 177 THz. We observe measurement resolution at the nanometer (attosecond) scale with only $O(10^4)$ photon pairs, despite the presence of background and loss. Our non-destructive thickness measurement of a metallic thin film agrees with atomic force microscopy, which often achieves better resolution via destructive means. With contactless, non-destructive measurements in seconds or faster, our instrument enables metrological studies in optically challenging contexts where background, loss, or photosensitivity are factors.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and selection rules in photoelectron chiral dichroism from tailored light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method whereby randomly oriented chiral molecules are irradiated by circularly-polarized light, photoionizing electrons, which are measured in a momentum-resolved manner. This scheme permits chiral light-matter interactions within the electric-dipole approximation (avoiding weak magnetic-dipole interactions), yielding huge chiral signals in the form of a forwards-backwards asymmetry in photoemission. Recently, more intricate realizations of PECD have been explored where the circularly-polarized light is replaced with elaborate polarization-tailored light (e.g. bi-chromatic, non-collinear, etc.), some of which do not even require circularly-polarized components, but still lead to massive chiral signals. However, the connection between generalized symmetries and asymmetries of the laser drive and selection rules in PECD have not yet been derived. Here we formulate this connection analytically from group theory, also predicting two previously unknown selection rules for PECD from fields with dynamical inversion and improper-rotational symmetries. We further propose bi-chromatic bi-elliptical fields for breaking symmetries in typical spectra, yielding potentially more information for ultrafast-resolved measurements. We numerically demonstrate all of our results with state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations in the archetypal chiral molecule, Bromochlorofluoromethane, providing predictions for experiments. Our work presents a roadmap for analyzing PECD from tailored light and resolved a long-standing issue in the field. It should motivate theoretical and experimental investigations in novel PECD set-ups.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Analysis of Ro-Vibrational Helical Dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helical dichroism (HD) is a proposed method for the resolution of molecular chirality, employing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. Going beyond the conventional assumptions about HD, this work proposes a rigid theoretical framework for the analysis of the HD, based on molecular symmetries and rotational eigenstates. We derive the rotational selection rules, which clearly establish that HD only emerges from the spin-orbit coupling of light, even for beams without far-field OAM. Our findings refine the conditions for observing HD, shedding light on the outcome of prior experiments and guiding future designs for chiral sensing using structured light.</description>

      <title>Estimation of multiple parameters encoded in the modal structure of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of estimating simultaneously multiple parameters encoded in the shape of the modes on which the light is expanded. For this, we generalize the mode-encoded parameter estimation theory as introduced in Ref.[1] to a multi-parameter scenario. We derive the general expression for the Quantum Fisher information matrix and establish the conditions under which the multi-parameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is attainable. In specific scenarios, we find that each parameter can be associated with a mode -- the detection mode -- that is proportional to the derivative of either a single non-vacuum mode or the mean-field mode. For a single non-vacuum mode, the correlation between parameters is determined by the real part of the overlap of these detection modes, while in the case of a strong mean-field by the covariance of the quadrature operators of the derivative modes. In both cases, the attainability of the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is determined by the imaginary part of the overlap of the detection modes. Our findings provide clear criteria for optimal joint estimation of parameters encoded in the modal structure of light, and can be used to benchmark experimental multi-parameter estimations and find optimal measurement strategies by carefully shaping the modes and populating them with non-classical light.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across discrete bands in the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-violet (UV) and near-UV wavelengths are necessary for many important optical transitions for quantum technologies and various sensing mechanisms for biological and chemical detection. However, all well-known photonic platforms have excessively high losses in the UV, which has prevented photonic integrated circuits (PICs) being used to address these and other important application spaces. Photonic waveguides using low-loss alumina cores have emerged as a promising solution because of almunia's large optical bandgap and the high quality of films enabled by atomic layer deposition. However, to the best of our knowledge, active alumina PICs have only been realized using thermo-optic tuning, which precludes switching speeds shorter than one microsecond, high circuit densities, and cryogenically compatible operation. Here, we introduce a CMOS-fabricated, piezo-optomechanical PIC platform using alumina waveguides with low optical losses at UV wavelengths and aluminum nitride piezoelectric strain actuators, which solves the issues associated with thermal tuning. We demonstrate a high-performance, reconfigurable optical filter operating at wavelengths as low as 320 nm. The filter has a 6 nanosecond switching time, a loaded linewidth of 3.3 GHz, tuning rate of -120 MHz/V, and a hold power less than 20 nW.</description>

      <title>Generalized flux trajectories: New insights into partially coherent Airy beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of Airy beams in free space is characterized by being non dispersive, which warrants the shape invariance of their intensity distribution, and self-accelerating along the transverse direction. These distinctive traits are still present in partially coherent Airy beams as long as the reach of their back tail (and hence their energy content) is not importantly reduced. To investigate the effects associated with the decrease of the beam coherence and its power content (by smoothly reducing the reach of their back tails), here we introduce a novel and insightful methodology based on a generalization of the concept of flux trajectory for paraxial partially coherent beams. This methodologies emphasizes the role of phase relations, thus helping to clarify why and how the beam smears out spatially along its propagation. This formalism, though, is general enough to tackle other types of structured light beams with whatever degree of partial coherence, from full coherence to total incoherence.</description>

      <title>Knife-Edge Diffraction of Scalar and Vector Vortex Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various methods have been introduced to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, from fork holograms to Dove prism interferometers, from tilted lenses to triangular apertures - each with their own benefits and limitations. Here we demonstrate how simple knife-edge diffraction can be used to identify the OAM of an optical phase vortex from the formation of fork dislocations within the Fresnel diffraction pattern. For vector vortex beams without net OAM, the conventional Fresnel fringes are recovered, whereas the polarization in the geometric shadow is changed in its ellipticity. The observed diffraction patterns agree with simulations and their features can be explained by considering diffraction as an interference phenomenon. Knife-edge diffraction provides not only an instructive illustration of various properties of phase and polarization vortices, but can also serve as an ideal method for the quick determination of optical OAM, with potential applications beyond optics, where alternative detection measurement methods may be harder to realize.</description>

      <title>Multiple truly topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons at terahertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unidirectional propagation based on surface magnetoplasmons (SMPs) has recently been realized at the interface of magnetized semiconductors. However, usually SMPs lose their unidirectionality due to non-local effects, especially in the lower trivial bandgap of such structures. More recently, a truly unidirectional SMP (USMP) has been demonstrated in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap, but it supports only a single USMP, limiting its functionality. In this work, we present a fundamental physical model for multiple, robust, truly topological USMP modes at terahertz (THz) frequencies, realized in a semiconductor-dielectric-semiconductor (SDS) slab waveguide under opposing external magnetic fields. We analytically derive the dispersion properties of the SMPs and perform numerical analysis in both local and non-local models. Our results show that the SDS waveguide supports two truly (even and odd) USMP modes in the upper topological non-trivial bandgap. Exploiting these two modes, we demonstrate unidirectional SMP multimode interference (USMMI), being highly robust and immune to backscattering, overcoming the back-reflection issue in conventional bidirectional waveguides. To demonstrate the usefullness of this approach, we numerically realize a frequency- and magnetically-tunable arbitrary-ratio splitter based on this robust USMMI, enabling multimode conversion. We, further, identify a unique index-near-zero (INZ) odd USMP mode in the SDS waveguide, distinct from conventional semiconductor-dielectric-metal waveguides. Leveraging this INZ mode, we achieve phase modulation with a phase shift from -$\pi$ to $\pi$. Our work expands the manipulation of topological waves and enriches the field of truly non-reciprocal topological physics for practical device applications.</description>

      <title>Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>

      <title>Compact, Large-Scale Photonic Neurons by Modulation-and-Weight Microring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fabrication imperfections, spatial constraints, and prohibitive costs collectively impede the scalability of neuromorphic photonics. In this work, we introduce a large-scale, compact photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously. This dual functionality is realized by leveraging both the carrier effect and thermal tunability, thereby merging modulation and weighting to conserve on-chip area, enhancing tuning efficiency, and capitalizing on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) for scalable implementations. In addition, we investigated a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. To illustrate the adaptability of the system's tasks, we explore both spatial and temporal domains, highlighting its versatility through two representative tasks: image processing and, for the first time, financial time series analysis, which represents a promising new frontier for neuromorphic photonics. These findings underscore the considerable promise of photonic computing in addressing a breadth of real-world challenges, particularly under escalating demands for both scalability and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting methods (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] the error free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 SC-PSAs used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given that 4DTC paper [18] was presented just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], and only these two groups were working on this problem, it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>

      <title>Interference Fringe Mitigation in Short-Delay Self-Heterodyne Laser Phase Noise Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-heterodyne techniques are widely used for laser phase noise characterization due to their simple experimental setup and the removed need for a reference laser. However, when investigating low-noise lasers, optical delay paths shorter than the laser coherence length become necessary. This introduces interference patterns that distort the measured phase noise spectrum. To compensate for this distortion, we introduce a robust data-driven digital signal processing routine that integrates a kernel-based regression model into a phase noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) equalization framework. Unlike conventional compensation methods that rely on simplified phase noise models, our approach automatically adapts to arbitrary laser lineshapes by using Kernel Ridge Regression with automatic hyperparameter optimization. This approach effectively removes the interference artifacts and provides accurate PN-PSD estimates. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and effectiveness through simulations and via experimental measurements of two distinct low-noise lasers. The method's applicability to a broad range of lasers, minimal hardware requirements, and improved accuracy make this approach ideal for improving routine phase noise characterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth, compact and robust laser systems are of high interest, especially with prospects for portable quantum metrological applications. We realized an external cavity DFB-laser incorporating an intra-cavity EOM in a fully fiber-coupled manner. Additional active feedback on the EOM, by referencing a high finesse cavity, enabled us to reach low kHz-linewidths. We analyzed the laser spectrum by means of delayed self-heterodyne measurements to reconstruct the power spectral density. This is achieved by utilizing a data-driven power spectrum equalization approach. The presented laser setup is successfully used to create an ultracold gas by laser cooling on a narrow atomic transition of ${}^{40}$Ca at 1978 nm.</description>

      <title>Polaromechanics: cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</description>

      <title>Inducing a transition between thermal and many-body localized states and detecting many-body mobility edges through dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in MBL physics. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we suggest the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>
