      <title>Stability of extremal domains for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the second variation of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue on extremal domains and establish criteria for stability. We classify the stable extremal domains in the 2-sphere and in higher-dimensional spheres when the boundary is minimal. We also prove topological bounds for stable domains with nonnegative total Gaussian curvature in a general compact Riemannian surface.</description>

      <title>On canonical metrics of complex surfaces with split tangent and related geometric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study bi-Hermitian metrics on complex surfaces with split holomorphic tangent bundle and construct 2 types of metric cones. We introduce a new type of fully non-linear geometric PDE on such surfaces and establish smooth solutions. As a geometric application, we solve the prescribed Bismut Ricci problem. In various settings, we obtain canonical metrics on 2 important classes of complex surfaces: primary Hopf surfaces and Inoue surfaces of type $\mathcal{S}_{M}$.</description>

      <title>The Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle and the noncommutative integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [5], Connes and Chamseddine defined a Hochschild cocycle in the general framework of noncommutative geometry. They computed this Hochschild cocycle for the Dirac operator on 4-dimensioanl manifolds. We propose a way to study the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle from the viewpoint of the noncommutative integral on 6-dimensional manifolds in this paper. We compute several interesting noncommutative integral defined in [8] by the normal coodinated way on n-dimensional manifolds. As a corollary, the Connes-Chamseddine Hochschild cocycle on 6-dimensional manifolds is obtained.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on a K\"unneth formula for foliated de Rham cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K\"unneth formula is one of the basic tools for computing cohomology. Its validity for foliated cohomology, that is, for the tangential de Rham cohomology of a foliated manifold, is investigated. The main difficulty encountered is the non-Hausdorff nature of the foliated cohomology spaces, forbidding the completion of the tensor product. The results presented here are a K\"unneth formula when both factors have Hausdorff foliated cohomology, a K\"unneth formula when one factor has Hausdorff finite-dimensional foliated cohomology and a counterexample to an alternative version of the K\"unneth formula. The proof of the second result involves a right inverse for the foliated de Rham differential.</description>

Abstract: We introduce area-minimizing subgraphs in an infinite graph via the formulation of functions of bounded variations initiated by De Giorgi.

      <title>Chirality Effects in Molecular Chainmail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of positive Gaussian curvature in kinetoplast DNA networks, we consider the effect of linking chirality in square lattice molecular chainmail networks using Langevin dynamics simulations and constrained gradient optimization. Linking chirality here refers to ordering of over-under versus under-over linkages between a loop and its neighbors. We consider fully alternating linking, maximally non-alternating, and partially non-alternating linking chiralities. We find that in simulations of polymer chainmail networks, the linking chirality dictates the sign of the Gaussian curvature of the final state of the chainmail membranes. Alternating networks have positive Gaussian curvature, similar to what is observed in kinetoplast DNA networks. Maximally non-alternating networks form isotropic membranes with negative Gaussian curvature. Partially non-alternating networks form flat diamond-shaped sheets which undergo a thermal folding transition when sufficiently large, similar to the crumpling transition in tethered membranes. We further investigate this topology-curvature relationship on geometric grounds by considering the tightest possible configurations and the constraints that must be satisfied to achieve them.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Cheeger and Colding version of the Reifenberg theorem for metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Reifenberg's theorem says that a set which is sufficiently well approximated by planes uniformly at all scales is a topological H\"older manifold. Remarkably, this generalizes to metric spaces, where the approximation by planes is replaced by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This fact was shown by Cheeger and Colding in an appendix of one of their celebrated works on Ricci limit spaces [8]. Given the recent interest around this statement in the growing field of analysis in metric spaces, in this note we provide a self contained and detailed proof of the Cheeger and Colding result. Our presentation substantially expands the arguments in [8] and makes explicit all the relevant estimates and constructions. As a byproduct we also shows a biLipschitz version of this result which, even if folklore among experts, was not present in the literature. This work is an extract from the doctoral dissertation of the second author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider actions of a tileable amenable group $\Gamma$ on a topological space $X$. For a continuous function on $X$, we define the entropy of the number of homologically detectable critical point of the average of that function over $\Gamma$. This number is bounded below by the sum of the Betti number entropy. This result is thus a generalization of a standard Morse inequality in differential geometry to this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>Spectral geometry on manifolds with fibred boundary metrics I: Low energy resolvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.10125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low energy resolvent of the Hodge Laplacian on a manifold equipped with a fibred boundary metric. We determine the precise asymptotic behavior of the resolvent as a fibred boundary (aka $\phi$-) pseudodifferential operator when the resolvent parameter tends to zero. This generalizes previous work by Guillarmou and Sher who considered asymptotically conic metrics, which correspond to the special case when the fibres are points. The new feature in the case of non-trivial fibres is that the resolvent has different asymptotic behavior on the subspace of forms that are fibrewise harmonic and on its orthogonal complement. To deal with this, we introduce an appropriate 'split' pseudodifferential calculus, building on and extending work by Grieser and Hunsicker. Our work sets the basis for the discussion of spectral invariants on $\phi$-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We derive various eigenvalue estimates for the Hodge Laplacian acting on differential forms on weighted Riemannian manifolds. Our estimates unify and extend various results from the literature and we provide a number of geometric applications. In particular, we derive an inequality which relates the eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator for (f)-minimal hypersurfaces and the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian.</description>

As applications, we obtain a new volume rigidity result of the gradient Ricci almost solitons. Furthermore, we extend the results of Cao and Zhou \cite{CZ} to shrinking gradient Ricci almost solitons and get the rigidity result with respect to the maximal volume growth.</description>

Abstract: A polygonal surface in the pseudo-hyperbolic space H^(2,n) is a complete maximal surface bounded by a lightlike polygon in the Einstein universe Ein^(1,n) with finitely many vertices. In this article, we give several characterizations of them. Polygonal surfaces are characterized by finiteness of their total curvature and by asymptotic flatness. They have parabolic type and polynomial quartic differential. Our result relies on a comparison between three ideal boundaries associated with a maximal surface, corresponding to three distinct distances naturally defined on the maximal surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a smooth manifold, we associate to any closed differential form a mapping cone complex. The cohomology of this mapping cone complex can vary with the de Rham cohomology class of the closed form. We present a novel Morse theoretical description for the mapping cone cohomology. Specifically, we introduce a Morse complex for the mapping cone complex which is generated by pairs of critical points with the differential defined by gradient flows and an integration of the closed form over spaces of gradient flow lines. We prove that the cohomology of our cone Morse complex is isomorphic to the mapping cone cohomology and hence independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex. We also obtain sharp inequalities that bound the dimension of the mapping cone cohomology in terms of the number of Morse critical points and the properties of the specified closed form. Our results are widely applicable, especially for any manifold equipped with a geometric structure described by a closed differential form. We also obtain a bound on the difference between the number of Morse critical points and the Betti numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the space of mixed-volume forms endowed with an $L^2$ metric on a balanced manifold. A geodesic equation can be derived in this space that has an interesting structure and extends the equation of Donaldson \cite{Donaldson10} and Chen-He \cite{CH11} in the space of volume forms on a Riemannian manifold. This nonlinear PDE is studied in detail and the existence of weak solution is shown for the Dirichlet problem, under a positivity assumption. Later we study the Calabi-Yau equation for balanced metrics and introduce a geometric criteria for prescribing volume forms that is closely related to the positivity assumption above. We call this assumption the sub-Astheno-K\"ahler condition. By deriving $C^0$ a priori estimates, we show that the existence of solutions can be established on all sub-Astheno-K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Moduli of hybrid curves I: Variations of canonical measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is the first in a series devoted to the study of asymptotic geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.
  We introduce the moduli space of hybrid curves as a new compactification of the moduli space of curves, refining the one obtained by Deligne and Mumford. This is the moduli space for multiscale geometric objects which mix complex and higher rank tropical and non-Archimedean geometries, reflecting both discrete and continuous features.
  We define canonical measures on hybrid curves which combine and generalize Arakelov-Bergman measures on Riemann surfaces and Zhang measures on metric graphs.
  We then show that the universal family of canonically measured hybrid curves over this moduli space varies continuously. This provides a precise link between the non-Archimedean Zhang measure and variations of Arakelov-Bergman measures in families of Riemann surfaces, answering a question which has been open since the pioneering work of Zhang on admissible pairing in the nineties.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of trapped surfaces in solutions to the Einstein field equations is intimately tied to the well-posedness properties of the corresponding Cauchy problem in the low regularity regime. In this paper, we study the question of existence of trapped surfaces already at the level of the initial hypersurface when the scale invariant size of the Cauchy data is assumed to be bounded. Our main theorem states that no trapped surfaces can exist initially when the Cauchy data are close to the data induced on a spacelike hypersurface of Minkowski spacetime (not necessarily a flat hyperplane) in the Besov $B^{3/2}_{2,1}$ norm. We also discuss the question of extending the above result to the case when merely smallness in $H^{3/2}$ is assumed.</description>

Abstract: Consider a positive integer $n$ and $\gamma_1&gt;-1,\cdots,\gamma_n&gt;-1$. Let $D=\{z\in {\Bbb C}:|z|&lt;1\}$, and let $(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ denote the Cartan matrix of $\frak{su}(n+1)$. Utilizing the ordinary differential equation of $(n+1)$th order around a singular source of ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system, as discovered by Lin-Wei-Ye ({\it Invent Math}, {\bf 190}(1):169-207, 2012), we precisely characterize a solution $(u_1,\cdots, u_n)$ to the ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial z\partial \bar z}+\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} e^{u_j}&amp;=\pi \gamma _i\delta _0\,\,{\rm on}\,\, D\\
  \frac{\sqrt{-1}}{2}\,\int_{D\backslash \{0\}} e^{u_{i} }{\rm d}z\wedge {\rm d}\bar z &amp;&lt; \infty
  \end{cases} \quad \text{for all}\quad i=1,\cdots, n \end{equation*} using $(n+1)$ holomorphic functions that satisfy the normalized condition. Additionally, we demonstrate that for each $1\leq i\leq n$, $0$ represents the cone singularity with angle $2\pi(1+\gamma_i)$ for the metric $e^{u_i}|{\rm d}z|^2$ on $D\backslash\{0\}$, which can be locally characterized by $(n-1)$ non-vanishing holomorphic functions at $0$.</description>

      <title>Stationarity and Fredholm Theory in Subextremal Kerr-de Sitter Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we proved that solutions to linear wave equations in a subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetime have asymptotic expansions in quasinormal modes up to a decay order given by the normally hyperbolic trapping, extending the results of Vasy (2013). One central ingredient in the argument was a new definition of quasinormal modes, where a non-standard choice of stationary Killing vector field had to be used in order for the Fredholm theory to be applicable. In this paper, we show that there is in fact a variety of allowed choices of stationary Killing vector fields. In particular, the horizon Killing vector fields work for the analysis, in which case one of the corresponding ergoregions is completely removed.</description>
