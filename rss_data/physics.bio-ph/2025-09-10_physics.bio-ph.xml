      <title>Injection and Imaging of Achiral Microswimmers in Zebrafish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06973v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable in vivo locomotion is essential for using magnetically actuated microswimmers for biomedical applications; however, while existing microswimmers have excellent motion control in vitro, their motion is greatly hindered inside living organisms. Moreover, previous work had only visually demonstrated in vivo motion through gradient pulling or rolling, but not swimming. This study investigated the injection and imaging of the achiral planar microswimmers (APMs) inside a live zebrafish embryo. The APMs can be actuated under a rotating magnetic field to generate a forward thrust at low Reynolds number environment. Combined with a safe injection technique and clear in vivo imaging at high resolution, it would be possible to control the swimming motion of APMs inside the zebrafish embryo. This work shows the safe injection and the clear imaging of an APM in a transparent zebrafish model, demonstrating the possibility for follow-up in-depth studies of the swimming motion of microswimmers in vivo.</description>

      <title>Arrested coarsening, oscillations, and memory from a conserved phase separating nucleator in a self-straining cytoskeletal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do phase separated cellular structures set their size? To elucidate this, we study the dynamics and steady states of a phase separating nucleator that is advected by the self-straining cytoskeletal network which it nucleates. We find (i) that the interplay between transport and the tendency of nucleators to phase separate arrests coarsening; (ii) that the system undergoes damped oscillations towards a patterned steady state with a well defined length scale; (iii) that the system supports a spectrum of patterned states of different steady length scales, enabling the retention of a mechano-chemical memory of the initial conditions. Together, our findings establish a physiologically plausible compound material made of the phase separating nucleator and the self-straining network as a paradigm for mechano-chemical scale selection and memory fixation in cells.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Biological Models Through Turing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turing patterns play a fundamental role in morphogenesis and population dynamics, encoding key information about the underlying biological mechanisms. Yet, traditional inverse problems have largely relied on non-biological data such as boundary measurements, neglecting the rich information embedded in the patterns themselves. Here we introduce a new research direction that directly leverages physical observables from nature--the amplitude of Turing patterns--to achieve complete parameter identification. We present a framework that uses the spatial amplitude profile of a single pattern to simultaneously recover all system parameters, including wavelength, diffusion constants, and the full nonlinear forms of chemotactic and kinetic coefficient functions. Demonstrated on models of chemotactic bacteria, this amplitude-based approach establishes a biologically grounded, mathematically rigorous paradigm for reverse-engineering pattern formation mechanisms across diverse biological systems.</description>

      <title>Determining the Role of Electrostatics in the Making and Breaking of the Caprin1-ATP Nanocondensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a multiscale computational approach to investigate the condensation process of the C-terminal low-complexity region of the Caprin1 protein as a function of increasing ATP concentration for three states: the initial mixed state, nanocondensate formation, and the dissolution of the droplet as it reenters the mixed state. We show that upon condensation ATP assembles via pi-pi interactions, resulting in the formation of a large cluster of stacked ATP molecules stabilized by sodium counterions. The surface of the ATP assembly interacts with the arginine-rich regions of the Caprin1 protein, particularly with its N-terminus, to promote the complete phase-separated droplet on a lengthscale of tens of nanometers. In order to understand droplet stability, we analyze the near-surface electrostatic potential (NS-ESP) of Caprin1 and estimate the zeta potential of the Caprin1-ATP assemblies. We predict a positive NS-ESP at the Caprin1 surface for low ATP concentrations that defines the early mixed state, in excellent agreement with the NS-ESP obtained from NMR experiments using paramagnetic resonance enhancement. By contrast, the NS-ESP of Caprin1 at the surface of the nanocondensate at moderate levels of ATP is highly negative compared to the mixed state, and estimates of a large zeta potential outside the highly dense region of charge further explains the remarkable stability of this phase separated droplet assembly. As ATP concentrations rise further, the strong electrostatic forces needed for nanocondensate stability are replaced by weaker Caprin1-ATP interactions that drive the reentry into the mixed state that exhibits a much lower zeta potential.</description>

      <title>Drug Washout and Viral Rebound: Modeling HIV Reactivation Under ART Discontinuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the persistence of latently infected CD4$^+$ T cells, achieving a functional cure for HIV-1 remains a significant challenge since the viruses are able to evade immune clearance, which in turn enables post-treatment viral rebound. Because traditional deterministic models assume a constant reactivation rate, they fail to capture the stochastic nature of latency reversal influenced by immune perturbations and ART pharmacokinetics. Thus, in this study, by using a Poisson-driven stochastic framework that incorporates fluctuations in activation rates, we study viral rebound dynamics. Via an exponentially decreasing drug washout model, we accurately quantifies the nonlinear interplay between ART decay and stochastic reactivation, improving the theoretical estimates of post-treatment control. Beyond the introduction of stochasticity, our model establishes a time-dependent viral reactivation framework that integrates periodic and random perturbations in the activation rates. Unlike conventional models that assume uniform (temporally independent reactivation), we show that latency reversal follows structured oscillatory patterns modulated by immune cycles, circadian rhythms, and transient inflammatory episodes. This finding suggests that viral rebound risk is dynamically shaped by immune fluctuations, contrary to the assumption of a constant reactivation probability. We also study the model system by incorporating Gamma-distributed waiting times to account for heterogeneity in reactivation kinetics, which in turn provides a more flexible characterization of reservoir dynamics. We believe that these insights have critical implications for HIV cure strategies.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Dependent Defect Merging Induces Bifurcated Dynamics in Active Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of defect merging remain poorly understood. Here we report a geometry-tunable merging mechanism in microtubule-motor networks initiated by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-close. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to zip up cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of overlapping boundary layers where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby merge the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is tunable by the network geometry.</description>

      <title>SynLlama: Generating Synthesizable Molecules and Their Analogs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models for exploring chemical space have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data, and offers strong performance in both forward and bottom-up synthesis planning compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for discovery.</description>

      <title>Repulsive particle interactions enable selective information processing at cellular interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features in adjacent external structures through a non-uniform binding energy. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.</description>
