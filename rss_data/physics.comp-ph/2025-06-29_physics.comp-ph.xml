      <title>Unbiased higher-order frictional contact using midplane and patch based segment-to-segment penalty method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly accurate, single-pass, unbiased frictional contact algorithm for higher-order elements based on the concept of midplane is presented. Higher-order elements offer a lucrative choice for contact problems as they can better represent the curvature of original geometries compared to the first-order elements. Compressive and frictional contact constraints are applied over the contact pairs of sub-segments obtained by the subdivision of higher-order segments. The normal traction depends upon the penalisation of true interpenetration, and frictional traction depends upon relative sliding between sub-segments over their shared patches. The midplane constructed by linearised subfacets can be corrected to account for local curvature of interacting physical surfaces. Demonstrated through multiple tests, the use of higher-order elements surpasses the accuracy of first-order elements for curved geometries. Its versatility extends from static to dynamic conditions for flat and curved interfaces including frictional contact. The presented examples include contact patch test, Hertzian contact, elastic collision, rotation of concentric surfaces, frictional sliding, self-contact and inelastic collision problems. Here, contact patch test matches the accuracy of finite elements and Hertzian contact shows smoother solution compared to first-order meshes. The elastic collision problem highlights the utility of the algorithm in accurate prediction of configuration changes in multibody systems. The frictional sliding demonstrates the ability to represent the expected nonlinear distribution of nodal forces for the higher-order elements. The large deformation problems, e.g. self-contact and inelastic collision, specifically benefit from the accuracy in surface representation using higher-order discretisation and continuous contact constraint imposition on such surfaces during deformation.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Simulations of Turbulent Flows using Lattice Boltzmann Methods on Heterogeneous High Performance Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current GPU-accelerated supercomputers promise to enable large-scale simulations of turbulent flows. Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM) are particularly well-suited to fulfilling this promise due to their intrinsic compatibility with highly parallel execution on both SIMD CPUs and GPUs. A novel LBM scheme for wall-modeled LES in complex geometries is described with a special focus on the efficient implementation in the open source LBM framework OpenLB. Detailed scalability results are provided for all HoreKa partitions, utilizing up to 128 nodes and covering problem sizes up to 18 billion cells.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network framework for solving forward and inverse flexoelectric problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, the coupling between strain gradients and electric polarization, poses significant computational challenges due to its governing fourth-order partial differential equations that require C1-continuous solutions. To address these issues, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework grounded in an energy-based formulation that treats both forward and inverse problems within a unified architecture. The forward problem is recast as a saddle-point optimization of the total potential energy, solved via the deep energy method (DEM), which circumvents the direct computation of high-order derivatives. For the inverse problem of identifying unknown flexoelectric coefficients from sparse measurements, we introduce an additional variational loss that enforces stationarity with respect to the electric potential, ensuring robust and stable parameter inference. The framework integrates finite element-based numerical quadrature for stable energy evaluation and employs hard constraints to rigorously enforce boundary conditions. Numerical results for both direct and converse flexoelectric effects show excellent agreement with mixed-FEM solutions, and the inverse model accurately recovers material parameters from limited data. This study establishes a unified, mesh-compatible, and scalable PINN approach for high-order electromechanical problems, offering a promising alternative to traditional simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: A Tutorial on Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (U-MLIPs) have demonstrated broad applicability across diverse atomistic systems but often require fine-tuning to achieve task-specific accuracy. While the number of available U-MLIPs and their fine-tuning applications is rapidly expanding, there remains a lack of systematic guidance on how to effectively fine-tune these models. This tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to fine-tuning U-MLIPs for computational materials modeling. Using the recently released MACE-MP-0 as a representative example, we cover key aspects of the fine-tuning process, including dataset preparation, hyperparameter selection, model training, and validation. The effectiveness of fine-tuning is demonstrated through case studies involving force prediction in solid-state electrolytes, stacking fault defects in metals, and solid--liquid interfacial interactions in low-dimensional systems. To support practical applications, we include code examples that enable researchers, particularly those new to the field, to efficiently incorporate fine-tuned U-MLIPs into their workflows.</description>

      <title>Genuinely multi-dimensional stationarity preserving global flux Finite Volume formulation for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Finite Volume methods for multi-dimensional problems include stabilization (e.g. via a Riemann solver), that is derived by considering several one-dimensional problems in different directions. Such methods therefore ignore a possibly existing balance of contributions coming from different directions, such as the one characterizing multi-dimensional stationary states. Instead being preserved, they are usually diffused away by such methods. Stationarity preserving methods use a better suited stabilization term that vanishes at the stationary state, allowing the method to preserve it. This work presents a general approach to stationarity preserving Finite Volume methods for nonlinear conservation/balance laws. It is based on a multi-dimensional extension of the global flux approach. The new methods are shown to significantly outperform existing ones even if the latter are of higher order of accuracy and even on non-stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Thermodynamics of Liquid Water from Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics, introduced over two centuries ago, remains foundational to our understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering systems. Its principles are traditionally grounded in the statistical mechanics framework, which explains macroscopic behavior from microscopic states. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that interprets thermodynamic behavior through the lenses of time series analysis, an approach commonly used in other fields, including finance, climate, and signal processing. We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, the most complex, anomalous, and important substance known, over a wide range of its phase diagram. By examining the temporal evolution of the hydrogen bond network (HBN) topology, we demonstrate that the dynamics of microscopic topological motifs populating the HBN encode the system's macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, our approach enables the prediction of thermodynamic properties in regions beyond those directly sampled in our simulations. We achieve this result by leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in temporally resolved data that are often lost through conventional averaging. This work offers new insights into the fundamental behavior of water and network-forming materials more broadly, establishing a new paradigm for understanding material properties beyond the classical confines of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>A GENERIC-guided active learning SPH method for viscoelastic fluids using Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When applying machine learning methods to learn viscoelastic constitutive relations, the polymer history dependence in viscoelastic fluids and the generalization ability of machine learning models are challenging. In this paper, guided by the general equation for nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework, a novel GENERIC-guided active learning smoothed particle hydrodynamics (${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$) method is proposed to obtain effective constitutive relations for reliable simulations of viscoelastic flows. By utilizing the GENERIC framework, the target viscoelastic constitutive relation is reduced to a simple functional relation between the eigenvalues of the conformation tensor and the eigenvalues of its thermodynamically conjugated tensorial variable, which incorporates the flow-history-dependent memory effect. Based on data and Gaussian process regression (GPR), a new active learning strategy is developed to obtain the simplified constitutive relation, in which the generalization ability is ensured by actively acquiring more data points when needed. Moreover, a novel relative uncertainty is devised to establish an accuracy evaluation tool for the GPR prediction results, which reduces the number of required training data points while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, the SPH method combined with the latest techniques serves as an effective macroscopic numerical method. Eventually, the Poiseuille flows and the flows around a periodic array of cylinders at different Weissenberg numbers are simulated to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method. The Oldroyd-B model is used as the ground truth constitutive relation to provide data for GPR, bringing analytical solutions for comparison. The excellent performance demonstrates that the ${\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method has promising applications in data-driven simulations of viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Species Enskog-Vlasov Solver to Determine Evaporation Coefficients of Fluids in High Pressure Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-species Enskog-Vlasov solver. It is used to determine evaporation coefficients of fluids under high-pressure conditions, a critical factor for efficient fuel mixing in internal combustion engines. The solver handles collisions for different fluid species separately, thereby accurately capturing species-specific interactions essential for realistic evaporation modeling. A new pair correlation function based on the BMCSL equation of state is employed to enhance modeling accuracy, though compliance with Onsager relations remains to be explored.
  Validation through various numerical simulations demonstrates the solver's capability. Results from binary fluid relaxation simulations closely match molecular dynamics (MD) data, highlighting accurate collision frequency modeling. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art models verify the solver's precision in predicting liquid-vapor equilibria and evaporation coefficients across diverse pressure scenarios.
  Detailed simulations of argon-neon mixtures with realistic particle diameters and masses underscore the significant improvements achieved by employing this multi-species approach over traditional single-species methods. Comparisons with the SAFT-VRQ Mie and classical density functional theory confirm the solver's reliability in predicting liquid and vapor compositions and detailed density profiles at interfaces over a wide range of pressures and temperatures.
  Further analyses illustrate complex dependencies of evaporation and condensation coefficients on temperature and pressure, consistent with existing research findings. Overall, this work advances computational modeling of multi-species evaporation processes in high-pressure environments at different temperatures, providing essential data for improved combustion modeling and broader applications in multi-phase fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Finite Difference WENO-like Scheme with Physical Constraint Preservation for Divergence-Preserving Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternative finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (AFD-WENO) schemes allow us to very efficiently update hyperbolic systems even in complex geometries. Recent innovations in AFD-WENO methods allow us to treat hyperbolic system with non-conservative products almost as efficiently as conservation laws. However, some PDE systems,like computational electrodynamics (CED) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), have involution constraints that require divergence-free or divergence-preserving evolution of vector fields. In such situations, a Yee-style collocation of variables proves indispensable; and that collocation is retained in this work. In previous works, only higher order finite volume discretization of such involution constrained systems was possible. In this work, we show that substantially more efficient AFD-WENO methods have been extended to encompass divergence-preserving hyperbolic PDEs.
  Our method retains the Yee-style collocation of normal components of...</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis and design of shell-based thermal lattice metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis framework for investigating the thermal conductivity of shell lattice metamaterials, extending prior work from mechanical stiffness to heat transfer. Central to our analysis is a new metric, the asymptotic directional conductivity (ADC), which captures the leading-order influence of the middle surface geometry on the effective thermal conductivity in the vanishing-thickness limit. A convergence theorem is established for evaluating ADC, along with a sharp upper bound and the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving this bound. These results provide the first theoretical justification for the optimal thermal conductivity of triply periodic minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we show that ADC yields a third-order approximation to the effective conductivity of shell lattices at low volume fractions. To support practical design applications, we develop a discrete algorithm for computing and optimizing ADC over arbitrary periodic surfaces. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Linearization Scheme of Shallow Water Equations for Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics lies at the heart of many issues in science and engineering, but solving the associated partial differential equations remains computationally demanding. With the rise of quantum computing, new approaches have emerged to address these challenges. In this work, we investigate the potential of quantum algorithms for solving the shallow water equations, which are, for example, used to model tsunami dynamics. By extending a linearization scheme previously developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 013036 (2025)] for the Navier-Stokes equations, we create a mapping from the nonlinear shallow water equation to a linear system of equations, which, in principle, can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum device than on a classical computer. To validate our approach, we compare its results to an analytical solution and benchmark its dependence on key parameters. Additionally, we implement a quantum linear system solver based on quantum singular value transformation and study its performance in connection to our mapping. Our results demonstrate the potential of applying quantum algorithms to fluid dynamics problems and highlight necessary considerations for future developments.</description>

      <title>Modeling the g-factors, hyperfine interaction and optical properties of semiconductor QDs: the atomistic and eight-band $k \cdot p$ approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparative study of two important theoretical approaches: atomistic sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding and continuum eight-band $k \cdot p$ methods, for modeling the spin and optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). Our investigation spans key physical observables, including single-particle energy levels, g-factors, exciton radiative lifetimes, and hyperfine-induced Overhauser field fluctuations. We perform our calculations for self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs QD systems as representative case studies. While both methods yield qualitatively consistent trends, quantitative discrepancies arise due to different treatment of atomistic details, strain effects, and confinement. We introduce targeted corrections to the eight-band $k \cdot p$ framework, including a modified deformation potential scheme and adjusted remote-band contributions, to improve agreement with atomistic results, especially for electron g-factors and single-particle energies. Furthermore, we validate the eight-band implementation of hyperfine interactions by benchmarking it against the tight-binding model, showing reasonable convergence for both electrons and holes. Our results establish criteria for selecting the appropriate modeling framework based on the desired physical accuracy and computational efficiency in spin-optical studies of semiconductor QDs.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>

      <title>Great Restraining Wall in Multidimensional Collective Variable Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling methods are pivotal for exploring rare events in molecular dynamics (MD), yet face challenges in high-dimensional collective variable (CV) spaces where exhaustive sampling becomes computationally prohibitive. While techniques like metadynamics (MetaD) and path-CV enable targeted free energy surface (FES) reconstruction, they often struggle with confinement stability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and geometric flexibility. This work introduces the Great Restraining Wall (GW) method, a robust framework for efficient FES sampling within predefined CV subspaces, addressing these limitations through a novel kernel density estimation (KDE)-derived restraining potential. GW operates by constructing a bias potential that confines sampling to user defined regions ranging from multidimensional masks to 1D pathways via asymptotically half-harmonic barriers. Unlike MetaD variants requiring iterative bias deposition, GW potential is derived from a cumulative distribution function, ensuring confinement without manual hyperparameter tuning. GW provides a versatile, stable, and efficient framework for targeted FES sampling, particularly beneficial for complex biomolecular systems with intricate CV landscapes. Its integration with existing enhanced sampling protocols opens avenues for studying ligand binding, conformational transitions, and other rare events with unprecedented precision. Future work will explore GW extension to adaptive regions and machine learning-guided CV discovery.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Capabilities of the Frontier Large Language Models for Nuclear Energy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation, and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities, and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks. However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems in Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems that feature non-Markovian dynamics are routinely solved using techniques such as the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM). However, their usage of the entire system density-matrix renders them intractable for many-body systems. Here, we combine the HEOM with the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy to achieve a rigorous description of open many-body systems in contact with structured photonic and phononic baths. We first rationalize that this stacked hierarchy accounts for spin-squeezing and superradiant emission despite its applicability to arbitrarily many emitters. The full potential of BBGKY-HEOM is then illustrated for two relevant applications: (i) the explicit treatment of vibrational modes provides access to resonant enhancements in few-emitter lasing, and (ii) the impact of phononic coupling and charge noise on many-body electronic systems embedded in host materials (e.g. molecules in organic crystals) is as relevant as electronic correlation. Our work establishes an accessible, yet rigorous, route between condensed matter and quantum optics, fostering the growth of a new domain at their interface.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Surrogate Modeling and Multi-Fidelity Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics simulations have become fundamental tools to study myriad engineering systems. As physics simulations often involve simplifications, their outputs should be calibrated using real-world data. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based surrogate (DBS) that calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with diffusion generative processes. DBS categorizes multi-fidelity physics simulations into inexpensive and expensive simulations, depending on the computational costs. The inexpensive simulations, which can be obtained with low latency, directly inject contextual information into diffusion models. Furthermore, when results from expensive simulations are available, \name refines the quality of generated samples via a guided diffusion process. This design circumvents the need for large amounts of expensive physics simulations to train denoising diffusion models, thus lending flexibility to practitioners. DBS builds on Bayesian probabilistic models and is equipped with a theoretical guarantee that provides upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the sample and underlying true distribution. The probabilistic nature of DBS also provides a convenient approach for uncertainty quantification in prediction. Our models excel in cases where physics simulations are imperfect and sometimes inaccessible. We use a numerical simulation in fluid dynamics and a case study in laser-based metal powder deposition additive manufacturing to demonstrate how DBS calibrates multi-fidelity physics simulations with observations to obtain surrogates with superior predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Local Molecular Interactions via Equivariant Local Representations and Charge Equilibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) potentials relying on chemical locality offer near-quantum mechanical accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs. Message-passing GNNs model interactions beyond their immediate neighborhood by propagating local information between neighboring particles while remaining effectively local. However, locality precludes modeling long-range effects critical to many real-world systems, such as charge transfer, electrostatic interactions, and dispersion effects. In this work, we propose the Charge Equilibration Layer for Long-range Interactions (CELLI) to address the challenge of efficiently modeling non-local interactions. This novel architecture generalizes the classical charge equilibration (Qeq) method to a model-agnostic building block for modern equivariant GNN potentials. Therefore, CELLI extends the capability of GNNs to model long-range interactions while providing high interpretability through explicitly modeled charges. On benchmark systems, CELLI achieves state-of-the-art results for strictly local models. CELLI generalizes to diverse datasets and large structures while providing high computational efficiency and robust predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of a superabsorbing thin-film semiconductor metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a computational inverse design method for optimizing broadband-absorbing metasurfaces made of arbitrary dispersive media. Our figure of merit is the time-averaged instantaneous power dissipation in a single unit cell within a periodic array. Its time-domain formulation allows capturing the response of arbitrary dispersive media over any desired spectral range. Employing the time-domain adjoint method within a topology optimization framework enables the design of complex metasurface structures exhibiting unprecedented broadband absorption. We applied the method to a thin-film Silicon-on-insulator configuration and explored the impact of structural and (time-domain inherent) excitation parameters on performance over the visible-ultraviolet. Since our incorporated material model can represent any linear material, the method can also be applied to other all-dielectric, plasmonic, or hybrid configurations.</description>

      <title>The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 1-10 (2025)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by an interface that is more disordered than bulk liquid. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.</description>
