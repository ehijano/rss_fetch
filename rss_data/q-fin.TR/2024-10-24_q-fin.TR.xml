      <title>Double Auctions: Formalization and Automated Checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double auctions are widely used in financial markets, such as those for stocks, derivatives, currencies, and commodities, to match demand and supply. Once all buyers and sellers have placed their trade requests, the exchange determines how these requests are to be matched. The two most common objectives for determining the matching are maximizing trade volume at a uniform price and maximizing trade volume through dynamic pricing. Prior research has primarily focused on single-quantity trade requests. In this work, we extend the framework to handle multiple-quantity trade requests and present fully formalized matching algorithms for double auctions, along with their correctness proofs. We establish new uniqueness theorems, enabling automatic detection of violations in exchange systems by comparing their output to that of a verified program. All proofs are formalized in the Coq Proof Assistant, and we extract verified OCaml and Haskell programs that could serve as a resource for exchanges and market regulators. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our work by running the verified program on real market data from an exchange to automatically check for violations in the exchange algorithm.</description>

      <title>Generation of synthetic financial time series by diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its practical significance, generating realistic synthetic financial time series is challenging due to statistical properties known as stylized facts, such as fat tails, volatility clustering, and seasonality patterns. Various generative models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), have been employed to address this challenge, although no model yet satisfies all the stylized facts. We alternatively propose utilizing diffusion models, specifically denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), to generate synthetic financial time series. This approach employs wavelet transformation to convert multiple time series (into images), such as stock prices, trading volumes, and spreads. Given these converted images, the model gains the ability to generate images that can be transformed back into realistic time series by inverse wavelet transformation. We demonstrate that our proposed approach satisfies stylized facts.</description>
