      <title>Diagnosing electron-neutrino lepton number crossings in core-collapse supernovae: a comparison of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast neutrino flavor conversion may impact the explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae. A necessary condition for fast flavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN crossing). Because of the computational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by the vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead, angular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in post-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods adopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce times, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically symmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\odot$ progenitor, testing cases with and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of proto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the angular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in distributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by using the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings identified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments. Our results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have severe limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward crossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a subset of our models. These findings highlight the need for robust modeling of the neutrino angular properties in order to assess the impact of flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism.</description>

      <title>Nowhere left to hide: revealing realistic gravitational-wave populations in high dimensions and high resolution with PixelPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of merging compact binaries observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors remain uncertain, with multiple astrophysical channels possibly contributing to the merger rate. Formation processes can imprint nontrivial correlations in the underlying distribution of source properties, but current understanding of the overall population relies heavily on simplified and uncorrelated parametric models. In this work, we use PixelPop-a high-resolution Bayesian nonparametric model with minimal assumptions-to analyze multidimensional correlations in the astrophysical distribution of masses, spins, and redshifts of black-hole mergers from mock gravitational-wave catalogs constructed using population-synthesis simulations. With full parameter estimation on 400 detections at current sensitivities, we show explicitly that neglecting population-level correlations biases inference. In contrast, modeling all significant correlations with PixelPop allows us to correctly measure the astrophysical merger rate across all source parameters. We then propose a nonparametric method to distinguish between different formation channels by comparing the PixelPop results back to astrophysical simulations. For our simulated catalog, we find that only formation channels with significantly different physical processes are distinguishable, whereas channels that share evolutionary stages are not. Given the substantial uncertainties in source formation, our results highlight the necessity of multidimensional astrophysics-agnostic models like PixelPop for robust interpretation of gravitational-wave catalogs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermionic Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars in the Light of Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the properties of dark matter admixed-neutron stars (DMANS), considering fermionic dark matter (DM) that interacts gravitationally with hadronic matter (HM). Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs) for both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) equations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is confined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic EoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision data, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as particle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied Bayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass, radii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and examined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson self-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical observations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing limited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter fraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or uncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is predominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high densities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass fraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial role in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating more realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may provide deeper insights into dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.</description>

      <title>An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the UHE Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) astrophysical neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization. A joint interpretation of the optical, infrared, and X-ray light curves suggests that MRC 0614-083 has undergone a super-Eddington accretion flare accompanied by efficient proton acceleration. That flare has initiated a delayed infrared echo within the surrounding dust torus, which serves as a target for photomeson ($p\gamma$) interactions such that a self-consistent picture emerges: the predicted UHE neutrino flux is at the level expected from joint $E^{-2}$ fit with the IceCube measurements at lower energies, the variable nature of the event alleviates the tension with IceCube limits, and the accompanying electromagnetic cascade describes the X-ray flare around the neutrino detection time. Since a key remaining uncertainty is the unknown redshift of the source, we strongly encourage optical/ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements to determine its redshift.</description>

      <title>Temporal evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations in an accreting black hole Swift J1727.8-1613: coevolution of the disk-corona during the state transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in black hole X-ray binaries, and their frequency has been found to correlate with various energy spectral properties. In this work, we present a detailed timing analysis of Swift J1727.8-1613, revealing a novel two-branch correlation between the QPO frequency and the observed disk emission, which differs from previous findings of a single correlation. Specifically, at QPO frequencies below 3 Hz, the QPO frequency is negatively correlated with the observed disk emission. Such a negative relation transitions to a positive one, as the QPO frequency exceeds approximately 3 Hz. The correlation between QPO frequency and Compton flux exhibits an opposite trend, with a positive correlation at lower frequencies and a negative correlation at higher ones. We interpret these behaviors as signatures of an evolving disk-corona geometry, within the framework of a Lense-Thirring precessing hot flow. Additionally, we find that during the flare state, the QPO fractional root-mean-square (rms) remains nearly constant above 15 keV, but increases with energy below this threshold. The slope of the rms-energy relation becomes steeper as the energy spectrum softens.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Study of the X-ray Emission from the TeV Blazar Mrk~421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive timing analysis of X-ray data from the {\it XMM-Newton} satellite, examining 50 light curves covering 17 years of observations of the blazar Mrk~421. This work uses classical deterministic and stochastic methods in a novel way, enabling the distinction of temporal scales and offering essential insights through correlations among parameters. Deterministic behaviors are primarily explored through recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), used innovatively by varying the threshold input parameter to examine variability at multiple temporal scales. To investigate behavior across various scales from a stochastic perspective, we apply both autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, with results from ARIMA more tightly related to short scales. Our findings reveal that Mrk~421's X-ray emission is a multifaceted process, driven by both deterministic and stochastic patterns, indicating a complex interplay of physical phenomena. Our study demonstrates that deterministic patterns are more pronounced at small temporal scales, which are disconnected from large scales. On the other hand, stochastic processes with memory propagate from large to small time scales, while noise affects both scales, as indicated by the correlation analysis. These results underscore the importance of advanced methodologies for interpreting astrophysical data, contributing to ongoing discussions in blazar physics by exploring connections between our calculated parameters and established models. The same approach can potentially be applied to other sources, enhancing our general understanding of variability and emission mechanisms in blazars.</description>

      <title>Proto-neutron Stars with Dark Matter Admixture: A Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of dark matter (DM) on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin--Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2\,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62\,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>3C 403: a candidate neutrino-emitting radio galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 403 is a well known FRII radio galaxy, whose jets extend up to the kpc scale. In this letter, we present its identification as the second most significant source among the more than 150 inspected using the 15-year neutrino dataset of the ANTARES Collaboration, possibly making it the first radio galaxy with neutrino emission. Following the previous association of blazars with netrinos events, we aimed at studying the jet properties and its possible role in neutrino production. We collected multi-scale radio observations to assess the properties of the jet from the kpc to pc scale. Moreover, the high-energy properties of its AGN were inspected. Through the analysis of the jet orientation on the different scales, we verified that neither the inner nor the extended jet seems to have a viewing angle close to the line of sight. Instead, the jet seems to lie on the plane of the sky. In addition, we tested the recently proposed scaling relation between neutrino and hard X-rays fluxes, identified for blazars and Seyfert galaxies, against the measured fluxes for 3C 304. We found that the source lies in the region between blazars and Seyferts, altough the current upper limit on neutrino flux does not allow us to be conclusive on the correlation. In these regards, 3C 403 is an intermediate case between the previous cases of neutrino associations, providing a useful test case for future models.</description>

      <title>Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Observability of Isolated Stellar-mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.</description>

      <title>Latent-space Field Tension for Astrophysical Component Detection An application to X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern observatories are designed to deliver increasingly detailed views of astrophysical signals. To fully realize the potential of these observations, principled data-analysis methods are required to effectively separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components from data corrupted by noise and instrumental effects. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-frequency Bayesian model of the sky emission field that leverages latent-space tension as an indicator of model misspecification, enabling automated separation of diffuse, point-like, and extended astrophysical emission components across wavelength bands. Deviations from latent-space prior expectations are used as diagnostics for model misspecification, thus systematically guiding the introduction of new sky components, such as point-like and extended sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic multi-frequency imaging data and apply it to observational X-ray data from the eROSITA Early Data Release (EDR) of the SN1987A region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our results highlight the method's capability to reconstruct astrophysical components with high accuracy, achieving sub-pixel localization of point sources, robust separation of extended emission, and detailed uncertainty quantification. The developed methodology offers a general and well-founded framework applicable to a wide variety of astronomical datasets, and is therefore well suited to support the analysis needs of next-generation multi-wavelength and multi-messenger surveys.</description>

      <title>The Low Mass Dwarf Host Galaxy of Non-Repeating FRB 20230708A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectroscopy for the host galaxies of 12 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observed through the ESO Large Programme "FURBY", which imposes strict selection criteria on the included FRBs and their host galaxies to produce a homogeneous and well-defined sample. We describe the data reduction and analysis of these spectra and report their redshifts, line-emission fluxes, and derived host properties. From the present sample, this paper focuses on the faint host of FRB ($m_R = 22.53 \pm 0.02$) identified at low redshift ($z=0.1050$). This indicates an intrinsically very low-luminosity galaxy ($L \approx 10^8 L_\odot$), making it the lowest-luminosity non-repeating FRB host to date by a factor of $\sim 3$, and slightly dimmer than the lowest-luminosity host for repeating FRBs. Our SED fitting analysis reveals a low stellar mass ($M_* \approx 10^{8.0} M_\odot$), low star formation rate (${\rm SFR} \approx 0.04 M_\odot \rm yr^{-1}$), and very low metallicity ($12+\log(\text{O}/\text{H})\sim(7.99-8.3)$), distinct from the more massive galaxies ($\log(M/M_\odot) \sim 10$) that are commonly identified for non-repeating FRBs. Its discovery demonstrates that FRBs can arise in among the faintest, metal-poor galaxies of the universe. In turn, this suggests that at least one FRB progenitor channel must include stars (or their remnants) created in very low metallicity environments. This indicates better prospects for detecting FRBs from the high-$z$ universe where young, low-mass galaxies proliferate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonzero neutrino masses guarantee new physics and neutrinos are excellent probes of extreme environments in the Universe. The recent collider neutrino experimental program, including FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC, along with the planned Forward Physics Facility at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, is opening a new window into neutrino physics and astrophysics. In this article, we review recent achievements and prospects of collider neutrino experiments, including key achievements such as the first measurements of collider neutrino interactions at unprecedented energies and the exploration of new physics scenarios, like dark matter candidates, sterile neutrinos, and non-standard neutrino interactions. For concreteness, we will focus on the significant scientific opportunities presented by the Forward Physics Facility, which will enable precision measurements of neutrino cross sections and proton structure at low parton momentum fraction. Furthermore, collider neutrino studies will substantially reduce systematic uncertainties in calculating atmospheric neutrino fluxes, thereby improving astrophysical neutrino observations as well as advancing our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Systematic NICER study of the low-ionized Fe K$\alpha$ line on RS Canum Venaticorum type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line ($\sim 6.4$ keV) has been observed during solar and stellar flares. Two emission mechanisms of the Fe K$\alpha$ line, photoionization and collisional ionization, have been discussed, and the aim of this work is to collect evidences for each mechanism employing a statistical correlation approach between the Fe K$\alpha$ line flux and rough flare properties. Here, we systematically searched the NICER (0.2$-$12 keV) archive data for the Fe K$\alpha$ line of RS Canum Venaticorum type stars. Among our analyzed 255 observation IDs with a total exposure of $\sim 700$ ks, we found 25 data sets (total $\sim 40$ ks) exhibiting the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.37$-$6.54 keV with its equivalent width of 44.3$-$578.4 eV: 18 observations during flares, 6 observations during unconfirmed possible flare candidates and one at a quiescent phase. These observations indicate a positive correlation between the Fe K$\alpha$ line intensity and the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $0.86 \pm 0.46$. This correlation in the range of the thermal plasma luminosity $10^{29-33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is consistent with the photoionization origin of the line. On the other hand, the equivalent width of the Fe K$\alpha$ line has a negative correlation with the 7.11$-$20 keV thermal plasma luminosity with its powerlaw index of $-0.27 \pm 0.10$. This anti-correlation is consistent with the decline of the fluorescence efficiency with increasing the stellar flare loop height. Furthermore, we found a signature of an absorption line at $6.38^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ keV during a superflare of $\sigma$ Gem. The equivalent width of the line was $-34.7^{+2.03}_{-1.58}$ eV. We discuss the density of the Fe ions from the equivalent width using the curve of growth analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Spike surrounding Supermassive Black Holes Binary and the Nanohertz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, CPTA and MPTA collaborations have reported compelling evidence for the existence of the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). This inferred background's amplitude and frequency spectrum align closely with the astrophysical predictions for a signal originating from the population of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Considering these findings, we explore the possibility of detecting dark matter (DM) spikes surrounding SMBHs, which could alter the gravitational-wave waveform and influence the SGWB. We show that the evolution of SMBH binaries, driven by both gravitational radiation and the dynamic friction of the surrounding DM spike, presents observable effects in the nHz frequency domain of the SGWB. We also employ the Bayesian inference method to fit the SGWB spectra from the NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA. The model with DM spike improves the fittings to the former two data sets. The spike slope $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ is slightly smaller than 1, which may suggest that the spike is flattened during the inspiral of the SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear coupling between magnetar QPOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the tails of magnetar giant $\gamma$-ray flares have long been interpreted as normal oscillation modes of these stars. However, most studies modelling QPOs have neglected some key features in the analyses of the signals, namely that QPOs appear to be detectable only intermittently and exhibit drifts in their frequencies. These are typical characteristics of nonlinear mode coupling, where, at leading order, the modes couple and evolve collectively as triplets. Using a representative triplet of modes, we solve the system's nonlinear equations of motion analytically and argue that the coupling is likely axial-axial-polar in nature, with the observed intermittence and frequency drifts providing a way to infer details of the magnetar's internal magnetic field geometry.</description>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>The kangaroo's first hop: the early fast cooling phase of EP250108a/SN 2025kg</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are a rare and poorly understood population of events. Previously difficult to detect in real time, the launch of the Einstein Probe with its wide field X-ray telescope has led to a rapid expansion in the sample and allowed the exploration of these transients across the electromagnetic spectrum. EP250108a is a recently detected example linked to an optical counterpart, SN 2025kg, or 'the kangaroo'. Together with a companion paper (Rastinejad et al. 2025), we present our observing campaign and analysis of this event. In this letter, we focus on the early evolution of the optical counterpart over the first six days, including our measurement of the redshift of $z=0.17641$. We find that the source is well-modelled by a rapidly expanding cooling blackbody. We show the observed X-ray and radio properties are consistent with a collapsar-powered jet that is low energy ($\lesssim10^{51}$ erg) and/or fails to break out of the dense material surrounding it. While we examine the possibility that the optical emission emerges from the shock produced as the supernova ejecta expand into a dense shell of circumstellar material, due to our X-ray and radio inferences, we favour a model where it arises from a shocked cocoon resulting from the trapped jet. This makes SN 2025kg one of the few examples of this currently observationally rare event.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Light Curve Parameter Estimation Using Likelihood-Free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid parameter estimation is critical when dealing with short lived signals such as kilonovae. We present a parameter estimation algorithm that combines likelihood-free inference with a pre-trained embedding network, optimized to efficiently process kilonova light curves. Our method is capable of retrieving the mass, velocity, and lanthanide fraction of the neutron star ejecta with an accuracy and precision on par with nested sampling methods while taking significantly less computational time. Our inference uniquely utilizes a pre-trained embedding network that marginalizes the time of arrival and the luminosity distance of the signal, allowing inference of signals at distances up to 200 Mpc. We find that including a pre-trained embedding outperforms the use of likelihood-free inference alone, reducing training time, model size, and offering the capability to marginalize over certain nuisance parameters. This framework has been integrated into the publicly available Nuclear Multi-Messenger Astronomy codebase, enabling the broader scientific community to deploy the model for their inference purposes. Our algorithm is broadly applicable to parameterized or simulated light curves of other transient objects, and can be adapted for quick sky localization.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases from ignoring environmental tidal effects in gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems are typically assumed to evolve in vacuum. However, the environment surrounding the binary components can influence their properties, such as their tidal deformability, affecting the gravitational waveform produced by the binary and its interpretation in gravitational wave data analysis. In this work we focus on next-generation experiments, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, and we quantify the systematic biases in gravitational wave observations that arise when tidally deformed binaries are interpreted as occurring in vacuum. We consider binaries over a range of masses and we compare different phenomenological models for the dynamical evolution of the tidal deformability. We find that systematic biases could significantly affect the measurability of the binary parameters if tidal effects are not carefully modeled.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>
