      <title>Stable Formulations in Optimistic Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of bilevel optimization problems tend to suffer from instability under changes to problem data. In the optimistic setting, we construct a lifted, alternative formulation that exhibits desirable stability properties under mild assumptions that neither invoke convexity nor smoothness. The upper- and lower-level problems might involve integer restrictions and disjunctive constraints. In a range of results, we at most invoke pointwise and local calmness for the lower-level problem in a sense that holds broadly. The alternative formulation is computationally attractive with structural properties being brought out and an outer approximation algorithm becoming available.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking for Linear Time-Varying Systems with Unknown Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bounded extremum seeking controls for time-varying linear systems with uncertain coefficient matrices and measurement uncertainty. Using a new change of variables, Lyapunov functions, and a comparison principle, we provide semiglobal exponential stability bounds for the states of the closed loop systems that hold for all nonnegative times. For the first time, we consider bounded extremum seeking controls in the presence of constant input delays and for linear time-varying systems with unknown control directions, and we provide reduction model controllers for quantifying the effects of the delays.</description>

      <title>Idle wage as a tool to regulate the relationship between ride-hailing platforms and drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms typically classify drivers as either employees or independent contractors. These classifications tend to emphasize either wage certainty or flexibility, but rarely both. We study an alternative or complementary approach: the \textit{Idle wage,} which provides with a fixed payment drivers even when they are connected without passengers on board. We adapt a well-known economic model of the supply-demand equilibrium in ride-hailing platforms and analyse how the optimal welfare and profit change with the introduction of an idle wage when drivers are risk-averse.
  We show that in a single-period setting, risk aversion implies that it is optimal to pay the drivers only through an idle wage. However, if the pool of available drivers is large, even a small idle wage could attract too many drivers, rendering the system unprofitable.
  When the demand fluctuates throughout multiple periods, we show that if the idle wage has to be constant, then it is optimal to combine the idle wage with the traditional payment via trips, so that surge pricing influences the number of drivers connected. This illustrates a relevant trade-off: Risk-aversion favours using the idle wage to attract drivers; however, if the platform is not allowed to fully adjust the idle wage over time, there may be periods in which the idle wage cannot resolve the mismatch between supply and demand. We propose a partially flexible constraint that still makes the idle wage-only solution viable. It allows the idle wage to adapt per period, as long as it fulfills a total minimum wage requirement.
  Numerical simulations suggest that the idle wage policy, if properly implemented, could be beneficial for the system as a whole.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Task Scheduling Algorithm Using Fuzzy Fitness Evaluation Method for Communication Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communications satellite networks (CSNs), as an integral component of the next generation of communication systems, have the capability to offer services globally. Data transmission in this network primarily relies on two modes: inter-satellite communication and satellite-to-ground station communication. The latter directly impacts the successful reception of data by users. However, due to resource and task limitations, finding a satisfactory solution poses a significant challenge. The communication satellite-ground station network scheduling problem (CS-GSNSP) aims to optimize CSN effectiveness by devising a plan that maximizes link construction time while considering constraints associated with satellite operation modes. The large number of tasks and numerous constraints in the problem result in a time-consuming evaluation of fitness function values. To address this issue, we propose a fuzzy fitness evaluation method (FFEA) that employs fuzzy or real evaluation methods based on individual similarity degrees. Additionally, we introduce an evolutionary algorithm based on FFEA (FFEEA) for iteratively searching high-quality network construction schemes. In FFEEA, an adaptive crossover approach is used for efficient population search. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed fuzzy fitness evaluation method and other improvement strategies significantly enhance satellite network service time.</description>

      <title>A New Active Set Scheme for Quadratic Programing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are faced with convex quadratic programing in many contexts related to control theory, economy and robotics. In this paper, we introduce a new active set algorithm for solving such problems and analyze its possible advantages. The novelty of the proposed scheme is in the way of solving the KKT system based on matrix properties. More precisely, we combine the two KKT equations to reduce the order and substitute it with a null space computation. The null space is in hand by use of the singular values decomposition. In problems with high number of independent constraints, we proposed another scheme. This also aims to solve the KKT system based on matrix properties. We implement both algorithms and test them over both randomly generated problems and standard problems mentioned in CUTEst. In general, more than 2000 tests with great variety are generated and computing times and accuracies are reported. The proposed schemes for solving convex quadratic problems are members of active set family. Because of using matrix properties, it reduces computing time and as larger as the problem is, the improvement shows to be more remarkable. The first strategy performs the original active set when the number of constraints is low while the second outperforms the original algorithm when there exists a lot of independent constraints.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions for the Continuous Algebraic Riccati Equation via Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the solution existence of the continuous-time algebraic Riccati equation (CARE). We formulate the CARE as two constrained polynomial optimization problems, and then use Lasserre's hierarchy of semi-definite relaxations to solve them. Compared to the existing work, our approaches can obtain the exact positive semi-definite solution of the CARE when the coefficient matrices are symmetric. Moreover, our methods can detect the nonexistence of the positive semi-definite solution for the CARE. Numerical examples show that our approaches are effective compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>On second-order variational analysis of variational convexity of prox-regular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational convexity, together with ist strong counterpart, of extended-real-valued functions has been recently introduced by Rockafellar. In this paper we present second-order characterizations of these properties, i.e., conditions using first-order generalized derivatives of the subgradient mapping. Up to now, such characterizations are only known under the assumptions of prox-regularity and subdifferential continuity and in this paper we discard the latter. To this aim we slightly modify the definitions of the generalized derivatives to be compatible with the $f$-attentive convergence appearing in the definition of subgradients. We formulate our results in terms of both coderivatives and subspace containing derivatives. We also give formulas for the exact bound of variational convexity and study relations between variational strong convexity and tilt-stable local minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores key aspects of the theory and applications of conformable fractional order systems. It begins by establishing the existence and uniqueness of the evolution operator for a class of non-autonomous homogeneous systems. Using the Schauder fixed point theorem and the theory of linear evolution systems, we delve into the existence of mild solutions for a class of non-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear systems. Additionally, the paper addresses the exact null controllability of abstract systems. We present an example to demonstrate the efficiency of the results.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Control in Standard Borel Spaces: Centralized MDP Reductions, Near Optimality of Finite Window Local Information, and Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Realizations of Positive Real Descriptor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between port-Hamiltonian and positive real descriptor systems is investigated. It is well-known that port-Hamiltonian systems are positive real, but the converse implication does not always hold. In [K. Cherifi, H. Gernandt, and D. Hinsen. The difference between port-Hamiltonian, passive and positive real descriptor systems. Math. Control Signals Systems, pages 1-32, 2023] sufficient conditions for the converse are presented. We refine these conditions and present for a completely controllable, completely observable and positive real descriptor system a necessary and sufficient condition as well as an explicit method to compute a port-Hamiltonian realization of a general positive real descriptor system.</description>

      <title>The Non-Substitution Theorem and Uniqueness of Solution in Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our first result is a statement of a somewhat general form of a non-substitution theorem for linear programming problems, along with a very easy proof of the same. Subsequently, we provide an easy proof of theorem 1 in Mangasarian (1979), based on a lemma that may be of some significance by itself. As a result of our lemma, we are able to show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a solution for a linear programming problem to be its unique solution, is that a system of linear inequalities has a solution whose last coordinate is non-negative.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Social Distancing under Partial Compliance of Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social distancing reduces infectious disease transmission by limiting contact frequency and proximity within a community. However, compliance varies due to its impact on daily life. This paper explores the effects of compliance on social distancing effectiveness through a "social distancing game," where community members make decisions based on personal utility. We conducted numerical experiments to evaluate how different policy settings for social distancing affect disease transmission.
  Our findings suggest several key points for developing effective social distancing policies. Firstly, while generally effective, overly strict policies may lead to noncompliance and reduced effectiveness. Secondly, the public health benefits of social distancing need to be balanced against social costs, emphasizing policy efficiency. Lastly, for diseases with low reinfection risk, a segmented policy exempting immune individuals could lessen both infections and socioeconomic costs.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Free Martingale Neural Network Soc-Martnet For The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations In Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14395v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient derivative-free version of a martingale neural network SOC-MartNet proposed in Cai et al. [2] for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. The solution of the HJB equation consists of two steps: (1) finding the optimal control from the value function, and (2) deriving the value function from a linear PDE characterized by the optimal control. The linear PDE is reformulated into a weak form of a new martingale formulation from the original SOC-MartNet where all temporal and spatial derivatives are replaced by an univariate, first-order random finite difference operator approximation, giving the derivative free version of the SOC-MartNet. Then, the optimal feedback control is identified by minimizing the mean of the value function, thereby avoiding the need for pointwise minimization on the Hamiltonian. Finally, the optimal control and value function are approximated by neural networks trained via adversarial learning using the derivative-free formulation. This method eliminates the reliance on automatic differentiation for computing temporal and spatial derivatives, offering significant efficiency in solving high-dimensional HJB equations and SOCPs.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Class of Quadratic Control-Lyapunov Functions for Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control laws derived from Control-Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) offer an efficient way for generating near-optimal many-revolution low-thrust trajectories. A common approach to constructing CLFs is to consider the family of quadratic functions using a diagonal weighting matrix. In this paper, we explore the advantages of using a larger family of quadratic functions. More specifically, we consider positive-definite weighting matrices with non-zero off-diagonal elements (hereafter referred to as "full" matrices). We propose a novel eigendecomposition method for parameterizing $N$-dimensional weighting matrices that is easy to implement and guarantees positive-definiteness of the weighting matrices. We use particle swarm optimization, which is a stochastic optimization algorithm, to optimize the parameters and generate near-optimal minimum-time low-thrust trajectories. Solutions obtained using a full positive-definite matrix are compared to the results from the (standard) diagonal weighting matrix for a number of benchmark problems. Results demonstrate that improvements in optimality are achieved, especially for maneuvers with large changes in orbital elements.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium and Minimax Theorems via Variational Tools of Convex Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first provide a simple variational proof of the existence of Nash equilibrium in Hilbert spaces by using optimality conditions in convex minimization and Schauder's fixed-point theorem. Then applications of convex analysis and generalized differentiation are given to the existence of Nash equilibrium and extended versions of von Neumann's minimax theorem in locally convex topological vector spaces. Our analysis in this part combines generalized differential tools of convex analysis with elements of fixed point theory revolving around Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and related issues.</description>

      <title>Taxicab distance based best-worst method for multi-criteria decision-making: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Best-Worst Method (BWM) is a well-known distance based multi-criteria decision-making method used for computing the weights of decision criteria. This article examines a taxicab distance based model of the BWM, with the objective of developing a framework for deriving the model's optimal weights by solving its associated optimization problem analytically. To achieve this, an optimal modification based optimization problem, equivalent to the original one, is first formulated. This reformulated problem is then solved analytically, and the optimal weight sets are derived from its solutions. Contrary to existing literature that asserts the uniqueness of optimal weight sets based on numerical examples, our findings reveal that, in some cases, the taxicab BWM leads to multiple optimal weight sets. This framework provides a solid mathematical foundation that enhances understanding of the model. It also eliminates the requirement for optimization software, improving the model's precision and efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical optimization is ubiquitous in modern applications. However, in practice, we often need to use nonlinear optimization models, for which the existing optimization tools such as Cplex or Gurobi may not be directly applicable and an (error-prone) manual transformation often has to be done. Thus, to address this issue, in this paper we investigate the problem of automatically verifying and synthesizing reductions, the solution of which may allow an automatic linearization of nonlinear models. We show that the synthesis of reductions can be formulated as an $\exists^* \forall^*$ synthesis problem, which can be solved by an SMT solver via the counter-example guided inductive synthesis approach (CEGIS).</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of Full-Scale Ship Maneuvering Characteristics During Berthing and Unberthing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging empirical data is crucial in the development of accurate and reliable virtual models for the advancement of autonomous ship technologies and the optimization of port operations. This study presents an in-depth analysis of ship berthing and unberthing maneuvering characteristics by utilizing a comprehensive dataset encompassing the operation of a full-scale ship in diverse infrastructural and environmental conditions. Various statistical techniques and time-series analysis were employed to process and interpret the operational data. A systematic analysis was conducted on key performance variables, including approach speed, drift angles, turning motions, distance from obstacles, and actuator utilization. The results demonstrate significant discrepancies between the empirical data and the established maneuvering characteristics. These findings have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of conventional maneuvering models, such as the Mathematical Modeling Group (MMG) model, and improve the conditions used in captive model tests for the identification of maneuvering model parameters. Furthermore, these findings could inform the development of more robust autonomous berthing and unberthing algorithms and digital twins.</description>

      <title>Frontal Slice Approaches for Tensor Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the row and column action methods for solving large-scale linear systems, in this work, we explore the use of frontal slices for solving tensor linear systems. In particular, this paper presents a novel approach for using frontal slices of a tensor $\mathcal{A}$ to solve tensor linear systems $\mathcal{A} * \mathcal{X} = \mathcal{B}$ where $*$ denotes the t-product. In addition, we consider variations of this method, including cyclic, block, and randomized approaches, each designed to optimize performance in different operational contexts. Our primary contribution lies in the development and convergence analysis of these methods. Experimental results on synthetically generated and real-world data, including applications such as image and video deblurring, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approaches and validate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove that there exists a unique perimeter minimizer among all piecewise smooth simple closed curves in $M_{\kappa}^2$ enclosing area $A &gt; 0$ $(A \leq 2{\pi}$ if ${\kappa} = 1)$, and it is a circle in $M_{\kappa}^2$ of radius $AS_{\kappa} \left( \dfrac{ \sqrt{ A ( 4 {\pi} - {\kappa} A ) } }{ 2 {\pi} } \right)$, where $AS_{\kappa}(t) := t$ if ${\kappa} = 0$, arcsin$(t)$ if ${\kappa} = 1$, sinh$^{-1}(t)$ if ${\kappa} =-1$. We also prove the isoperimetric inequality for $M_{\kappa}^2$. We give an elementary geometric proof which is uniform for all three simply connected space forms.</description>

Abstract: Identifying breakpoints in piecewise regression is critical in enhancing the reliability and interpretability of data fitting. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms based on the greedy algorithm to accurately and efficiently identify breakpoints in piecewise polynomial regression. The algorithm updates the breakpoints to minimize the error by exploring the neighborhood of each breakpoint. It has a fast convergence rate and stability to find optimal breakpoints. Moreover, it can determine the optimal number of breakpoints. The computational results for real and synthetic data show that its accuracy is better than any existing methods. The real-world datasets demonstrate that breakpoints through the proposed algorithm provide valuable data information.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based schemes for on-the-fly parameter estimation in dissipative dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies two particular algorithms, a Relaxation Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and a Relaxation Newton Iteration (RNI) scheme , for reconstructing unknown parameters in dissipative dynamical systems. Both algorithms are based on a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm for state reconstruction of A. Azouani, E. Olson, and E.S. Titi \cite{Azouani_Olson_Titi_2014}. Due to the CDA origins of these parameter recovery algorithms, these schemes provide on-the-fly reconstruction, that is, as data is collected, of unknown state and parameters simultaneously. It is shown how both algorithms give way to a robust general framework for simultaneous state and parameter estimation. In particular, we develop a general theory, applicable to a large class of dissipative dynamical systems, which identifies structural and algorithmic conditions under which the proposed algorithms achieve reconstruction of the true parameters. The algorithms are implemented on a high-dimensional two-layer Lorenz 96 model, where the theoretical conditions of the general framework are explicitly verifiable. They are also implemented on the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithms beyond the finite-dimensional setting. In each case, systematic numerical experiments are carried out probing the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, in addition to the apparent benefits and drawbacks between them.</description>

Abstract: Critical points of an invariant function may or may not be symmetric. We prove, however, that if a symmetric critical point exists, those adjacent to it are generically symmetry breaking.

      <title>Inexact Bregman Proximal Gradient Method and its Inertial Variant with Absolute and Partial Relative Stopping Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bregman proximal gradient method (BPGM), which uses the Bregman distance as a proximity measure in the iterative scheme, has recently been re-developed for minimizing convex composite problems without the global Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption. This makes the BPGM appealing for a wide range of applications, and hence it has received growing attention in recent years. However, most existing convergence results are only obtained under the assumption that the involved subproblems are solved exactly, which is unrealistic in many applications and limits the applicability of the BPGM. To make the BPGM implementable and practical, in this paper, we develop inexact versions of the BPGM (denoted by iBPGM) by employing either an absolute-type stopping criterion or a partial relative-type stopping criterion for solving the subproblems. The $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate and the convergence of the sequence are also established for our iBPGM under some conditions. Moreover, we develop an inertial variant of our iBPGM (denoted by v-iBPGM) and establish the $\mathcal{O}(1/k^{\gamma})$ convergence rate, where $\gamma\geq1$ is a restricted relative smoothness exponent depending on the smooth function in the objective and the kernel function. Specially, when the smooth function in the objective has a Lipschitz continuous gradient and the kernel function is strongly convex, we have $\gamma=2$ and thus the v-iBPGM improves the convergence rate of the iBPGM from $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$, in accordance with the existing results on the exact accelerated BPGM. Finally, some preliminary numerical experiments for solving the discrete quadratic regularized optimal transport problem are conducted to illustrate the convergence behaviors of our iBPGM and v-iBPGM under different inexactness settings.</description>

      <title>A Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Optimization Framework with Applications in Control and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new two-time-scale stochastic gradient method for solving optimization problems, where the gradients are computed with the aid of an auxiliary variable under samples generated by time-varying MDPs controlled by the underlying optimization variable. These time-varying samples make gradient directions in our update biased and dependent, which can potentially lead to the divergence of the iterates. In our two-time-scale approach, one scale is to estimate the true gradient from these samples, which is then used to update the estimate of the optimal solution. While these two iterates are implemented simultaneously, the former is updated "faster" than the latter. Our first contribution is to characterize the finite-time complexity of the proposed two-time-scale stochastic gradient method. In particular, we provide explicit formulas for the convergence rates of this method under different structural assumptions, namely, strong convexity, PL condition, and general non-convexity.
  We apply our framework to various policy optimization problems. First, we look at the infinite-horizon average-reward MDP with finite state and action spaces and derive a convergence rate of $O(k^{-2/5})$ for the online actor-critic algorithm under function approximation, which recovers the best known rate derived specifically for this problem. Second, we study the linear-quadratic regulator and show that an online actor-critic method converges with rate $O(k^{-2/3})$. Third, we use the actor-critic algorithm to solve the policy optimization problem in an entropy regularized Markov decision process, where we also establish a convergence of $O(k^{-2/3})$. The results we derive for both the second and third problem are novel and previously unknown in the literature. Finally, we briefly present the application of our framework to gradient-based policy evaluation algorithms in reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a network of agents that want to cooperatively minimize the sum of local cost functions depending on a common decision variable. We consider the challenging scenario in which objective functions are unknown and agents have only access to local measurements of their local functions. We propose a novel distributed algorithm that combines a recent gradient tracking policy with an extremum-seeking technique to estimate the global descent direction. The joint use of these two techniques results in a distributed optimization scheme that provides arbitrarily accurate solution estimates through the combination of Lyapunov and averaging analysis approaches with consensus theory. We perform numerical simulations in a personalized optimization framework to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We propose a random coordinate descent algorithm for optimizing a non-convex objective function subject to one linear constraint and simple bounds on the variables. Although it is common use to update only two random coordinates simultaneously in each iteration of a coordinate descent algorithm, our algorithm allows updating arbitrary number of coordinates. We provide a proof of convergence of the algorithm. The convergence rate of the algorithm improves when we update more coordinates per iteration. Numerical experiments on large scale instances of different optimization problems show the benefit of updating many coordinates simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust approximation method for solving chance constrained optimization (CCO) of polynomials. Assume the CCO is defined with an individual chance constraint that is affine in the decision variables. We construct a robust approximation by replacing the chance constraint with a robust constraint over an uncertainty set. When the objective function is linear or SOS-convex, the robust approximation can be equivalently transformed into linear conic optimization. Semidefinite relaxation algorithms are proposed to solve these linear conic transformations globally and their convergent properties are studied. We also introduce a heuristic method to find efficient uncertainty sets such that optimizers of the robust approximation are feasible to the original problem. Numerical experiments are given to show the efficiency of our method.</description>

Abstract: The paper concerns foundations of sensitivity and stability analysis in optimization and related areas, being primarily addressed constrained systems. We consider general models, which are described by multifunctions between Banach spaces and concentrate on characterizing their well-posedness properties that revolve around Lipschitz stability and metric regularity relative to sets. Invoking tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we introduce new robust notions of relative contingent coderivatives. The novel machinery of variational analysis leads us to establishing complete characterizations of the relative well-posedness properties and developing basic rules of variational calculus interrelated with the obtained characterizations of well-posedness. Most of the our results valid in general infinite-dimensional settings are also new in finite dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the almost equivalence between two-player zero-sum games and conic linear programming problems in reflexive Banach spaces. The previous fundamental results of von Neumann, Dantzig, Adler, and von Stengel on the equivalence between linear programming and finite games with strategy sets defined over $\mathbb{R}^n$, are therefore extended to more general strategy spaces. More specifically, we show that for every two-player zero-sum game with a bilinear payoff function of the form $u(x,y)=\langle y,Ax\rangle$, for some linear operator $A$, and strategy sets that represent bases of convex cones, the minimax theorem holds, and its game value and Nash equilibria can be computed by solving a primal-dual pair of conic linear problems. Conversely, the minimax theorem for the same class of games "almost always" implies strong duality of conic linear programming. The main results are applied to a number of infinite zero-sum games, whose classes include those of semi-infinite, semidefinite, time-continuous, quantum, polynomial, and homogeneous separable games.</description>

      <title>On damping a control system with global aftereffect on quantum graphs. Stochastic interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum graphs model processes in complex systems represented as spatial networks in various fields of natural science and technology. An example is the oscillations of elastic string networks, the nodes of which, besides the continuity conditions, also obey the Kirchhoff conditions, expressing the balance of tensions. In this paper, we propose a new look at quantum graphs as {\it temporal} networks, which means that the variable parametrizing the edges of a graph is interpreted as time, while each internal vertex is a branching point giving several different scenarios for the further trajectory of a process. Then Kirchhoff-type conditions may also arise. Namely, they will be satisfied by such a trajectory of the process that is optimal with account of all the scenarios simultaneously. By employing the recent concept of global delay, we extend the problem of damping a first-order control system with aftereffect, considered earlier only on an interval, to an arbitrary tree graph. The first means that the delay, imposed starting from the initial moment of time, associated with the root of the tree, propagates through all internal vertices. Bringing the system into the equilibrium and minimizing the energy functional with account of the anticipated probability of each scenario, we come to a variational problem. Then, we establish its equivalence to a self-adjoint boundary value problem on the tree for some second-order equations involving both the global delay and the global advance. The unique solvability of both problems is proved. In particular, the interval case when the coefficients of the equation are assumed to be discrete-time stochastic processes can be viewed as the extension to a tree.</description>

      <title>Online Mixed Discrete and Continuous Optimization: Algorithms, Regret Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an online mixed discrete and continuous optimization problem where a decision maker interacts with an unknown environment for a number of $T$ rounds. At each round, the decision maker needs to first jointly choose a discrete and a continuous actions and then receives a reward associated with the chosen actions. The goal for the decision maker is to maximize the accumulative reward after $T$ rounds. We propose algorithms to solve the online mixed discrete and continuous optimization problem and prove that the algorithms yield sublinear regret in $T$. We show that a wide range of applications in practice fit into the framework of the online mixed discrete and continuous optimization problem, and apply the proposed algorithms to solve these applications with regret guarantees. We validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KKT optimality conditions for multi-objective interval-valued optimization problem on Hadamard manifold are studied in this paper. Several concepts of Pareto optimal solutions, considered under LU and CW ordering on the class of all closed intervals in $\mathbb{R}$, are given. The KKT conditions are presented under the notions of convexity, pseudo-convexity and generalized Hukuhara difference. We show, with the help of an example, that the results done in this paper for solving multi-objective interval-valued optimization problems on Hadamard spaces are more general than the existing ones on Euclidean spaces. The main results are supported by examples.</description>

      <title>Copositivity criteria of a class of fourth order 3-dimensional symmetric tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly dicuss the non-negativity conditions for quartic homogeneous polynomials with 3 variables, which is the analytic conditions of copositivity of a class of 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensors. For a 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensor with its entries $1$ or $-1$, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is given for its strict copositivity with the help of the properties of strictly semi-positive tensors. And by means of usual maxi-min theory, a necessary and sufficient condition is established for copositivity of such a tensor also. Applying these conclusions to a general 4th order 3-dimensional symmetric tensor, the analytic conditions are successfully obtained for verifying the (strict) copositivity, and these conditions can be very easily parsed and validated. Moreover, several (strict) inequalities of ternary quartic homogeneous polynomial are established by means of these analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Practical Experience with Stable Set and Coloring Relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable Set and Graph Coloring belong to the class of NP-hard optimization problems on graphs. It is well known that even near-optimal solutions for these problems are difficult to find in polynomial time. The Lov\'asz theta function, introduced by Lov\'asz in the late 1970s, provides a powerful tool in the study of these problems. It can be expressed as the optimal value of a semidefinite program and serves as a relaxation for both problems. Considerable effort has been devoted to investigating additional cutting planes to strengthen these relaxations. In our work, we use these models and consider new classes of cutting planes based on small cliques and cycles contained in the underlying graph. We demonstrate that identifying such violated constraints can be done efficiently and that they often lead to significant improvements over previous bounds. However, our computational experiments also show that the quality of these improvements may decrease with problem size, and in some instances, no improvement is observed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Dynamics of Alternating Minimization for Bilinear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic dynamics of alternating minimization applied to optimize a bilinear non-convex function with normally distributed covariates. This is achieved by employing the replica method to a multi-temperature glassy system which unfolds the algorithm's time evolution. Our results show that the dynamics can be described effectively by a two-dimensional discrete stochastic process, where each step depends on all previous time steps, revealing the structure of the memory dependence in the evolution of alternating minimization. The theoretical framework developed in this work can be applied to the analysis of various iterative algorithms, extending beyond the scope of alternating minimization.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary Bandits with Habituation and Recovery Dynamics and Knapsack Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit models have proven to be useful in modeling many real world problems in the areas of control and sequential decision making with partial information. However, in many scenarios, such as those prevalent in healthcare and operations management, the decision maker's expected reward will decrease if an action is selected too frequently while it may recover if they abstain from selecting this action. This scenario is further complicated when choosing a particular action also expends a random amount of a limited resource where the distribution is also initially unknown to the decision maker. In this paper we study a class of models that address this setting that we call reducing or gaining unknown efficacy bandits with stochastic knapsack constraints (ROGUEwK). We propose a combination upper confidence bound (UCB) and lower confidence bound (LCB) approximation algorithm for optimizing this model. Our algorithm chooses which action to play at each time point by solving a linear program (LP) with the UCB for the average rewards and LCB for the average costs as inputs. We show that the regret of our algorithm is sub-linear as a function of time and total constraint budget when compared to a dynamic oracle. We validate the performance of our algorithm against existing state of the art non-stationary and knapsack bandit approaches in a simulation study and show that our methods are able to on average achieve a 13% improvement in terms of total reward.</description>

      <title>The Solution to an Impulse Control Problem Motivated by Optimal Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic impulse control problem that is motivated by applications such as the optimal exploitation of a natural resource. In particular, we consider a stochastic system whose uncontrolled state dynamics are modelled by a non-explosive positive linear diffusion. The control that can be applied to this system takes the form of one-sided impulsive action. The objective of the control problem is to maximise a discounted performance criterion that rewards the effect of control action but involves a fixed cost at each time of a control intervention. We derive the complete solution to this problem under general assumptions. It turns out that the solution can take four qualitatively different forms, several of which have not been observed in the literature. In two of the four cases, there exist only $\varepsilon$-optimal control strategies. We also show that the boundary classification of 0 may play a critical role in the solution of the problem. Furthermore, we develop a way for establishing the strong solution to a stochastic impulse control problem's optimally controlled SDE.</description>

      <title>AC False Data Injection Attacks in Power Systems: Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: False Data Injection (FDI) attacks are one of the challenges that the modern power system, as a cyber-physical system, is encountering. Designing AC FDI attacks that accurately address the physics of the power systems could jeopardize the security of power systems as they can easily bypass the traditional Bad Data Detection (BDD) algorithm. Knowing the essence of the AC FDI attack and how they can be designed gives insight about detecting the system again these attacks. Moreover, recognition of the nature of these attacks, especially when they are designed optimally, is essential for benchmarking various defensive approaches to increase the resilience of power systems. This paper presents a unified approach to demonstrate the process of designing optimal AC FDI attack. In this connection, we first define the process of designing an AC-based FDI attack that satisfies AC power flow equations. We then formulate an optimization problem to design an optimal AC FDI attack that both satisfies AC power flow equations and overloads a specific line in the system. The objective function is defined to optimize the magnitude of the attack vector in such a way that it can evade residue-based BDD approaches. The proposed approach for designing AC FDI attacks is applied to the IEEE 118-bus test case system. Various comparisons are conducted to elaborate on the impact of optimally designing AC FDI attacks on the residual for the AC state estimation algorithm. Comparing the results of optimal and non-optimal AC FDI attacks demonstrates the impact on the difficulty of detecting FDI attacks and the importance of optimally designing these attacks.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual-Assisted Penalty Approach to Bilevel Optimization with Coupled Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in bilevel optimization has grown in recent years, partially due to its applications to tackle challenging machine-learning problems. Several exciting recent works have been centered around developing efficient gradient-based algorithms that can solve bilevel optimization problems with provable guarantees. However, the existing literature mainly focuses on bilevel problems either without constraints, or featuring only simple constraints that do not couple variables across the upper and lower levels, excluding a range of complex applications. Our paper studies this challenging but less explored scenario and develops a (fully) first-order algorithm, which we term BLOCC, to tackle BiLevel Optimization problems with Coupled Constraints. We establish rigorous convergence theory for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on two well-known real-world applications - hyperparameter selection in support vector machine (SVM) and infrastructure planning in transportation networks using the real data from the city of Seville.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Low-Rank Factorization-Based Semidefinite Programming Algorithms on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a long-standing challenge: how to achieve both efficiency and scalability in solving semidefinite programming problems. We propose breakthrough acceleration techniques for a wide range of low-rank factorization-based first-order methods using GPUs, making the computation much more efficient and scalable. To illustrate the idea and effectiveness of our approach, we use the low-rank factorization-based SDP solver, LoRADS, as an example, which involves both the classic Burer-Monterio method and a novel splitting scheme with a starting logarithmic rank. Our numerical results demonstrate that the accelerated GPU version of LoRADS, cuLoRADS, can solve huge-scale semidefinite programming problems with remarkable efficiency. By effectively leveraging GPU computational power, cuLoRADS exhibits outstanding performance. Specifically, it can solve a set of MaxCut problems with $10^7 \times 10^7$ matrix variables in 10 seconds to 1 minute each on an NVIDIA H100 GPU with 80GB memory, whereas previous solvers demonstrated the capability of handling problems of this scale, required at least dozens of hours per problem on CPUs. Additionally, cuLoRADS shows exceptional scalability by solving 1) a MaxCut problem with a $170 \text{ million} \times 170 \text{ million}$ matrix variable and 2) a Matrix Completion problem with a 20 million $\times$ 20 million matrix variable and approximately 200 million constraints, both in a matter of minutes.</description>

      <title>A Bregman-Sinkhorn Algorithm for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable approximate algorithm for the NP-hard maximum-weight independent set problem. The core of our algorithm is a dual coordinate descent applied to a smoothed LP relaxation of the problem. This technique is referred to as Bregman method or Sinkhorn algorithm in the literature. Our algorithm addresses a family of clique cover LP relaxations, where the constraints are determined by the set of cliques covering the underlying graph. The objective function of the relaxation is smoothed with an entropy term.
  An important question determining efficiency of our algorithm is the control of the smoothing level over the course of optimization. While several dedicated techniques have been considered in the literature to this end, we propose a new one based on estimation of the relaxed duality gap. To make this estimation possible, we developed a new projection method to the feasible set of the considered LP relaxation. We experimentally show that our technique notably outperforms the standard one based on feasibility estimation.
  Additionally to solving the relaxed dual, we utilize a simple and very efficient primal heuristic to obtain feasible integer solutions of the initial non-relaxed problem. Our heuristic is a combination of the greedy generation and optimal recombination applied to the reduced costs computed by the dual optimization.
  Our experimental validation considers two datasets based on real-life applications, where our method shows competitive results being able to find high quality approximate solutions within 10 seconds for graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and dozens of millions of edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid zero-sum game problem, where the goal is to find a set in the state space, referred to as the reach-avoid set, such that the system starting at a state therein could be controlled to reach a given target set without violating constraints under the worst-case disturbance. We address this problem by designing a new value function with a contracting Bellman backup, where the super-zero level set, i.e., the set of states where the value function is evaluated to be non-negative, recovers the reach-avoid set. Building upon this, we prove that the proposed method can be adapted to compute the viability kernel, or the set of states which could be controlled to satisfy given constraints, and the backward reachable set, or the set of states that could be driven towards a given target set. Finally, we propose to alleviate the curse of dimensionality issue in high-dimensional problems by extending Conservative Q-Learning, a deep reinforcement learning technique, to learn a value function such that the super-zero level set of the learned value function serves as a (conservative) approximation to the reach-avoid set. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the proposed method could learn reliably the reach-avoid set and the optimal control policy even with neural network approximation.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Online Non-stochastic Control via FTRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper brings the concept of ``optimism" to the new and promising framework of online Non-stochastic Control (NSC). Namely, we study how NSC can benefit from a prediction oracle of unknown quality responsible for forecasting future costs. The posed problem is first reduced to an optimistic learning with delayed feedback problem, which is handled through the Optimistic Follow the Regularized Leader (OFTRL) algorithmic family. This reduction enables the design of \texttt{OptFTRL-C}, the first Disturbance Action Controller (DAC) with optimistic policy regret bounds. These new bounds are commensurate with the oracle's accuracy, ranging from $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for perfect predictions to the order-optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ even when all predictions fail. By addressing the challenge of incorporating untrusted predictions into online control, this work contributes to the advancement of the NSC framework and paves the way toward effective and robust learning-based controllers.</description>
