      <title>A Guide to Equivariant Parametrized Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates equivariant parametrized cellular cohomology, a cohomology theory introduced by Costenoble-Waner for spaces with an action by a compact Lie group $G$. The theory extends the $RO(G)$-graded cohomology of a $G$-space $B$ to a cohomology graded by $RO(\Pi B)$, the representations of the equivariant fundamental groupoid of $B$. This paper is meant to serve as a guide to this theory and contains some new computations.
  We explain the key ingredients for defining parametrized cellular cohomology when $G$ is a finite group, with particular attention to the case of the cyclic group $G=C_2$. We compute some examples and observe that $RO(\Pi B)$ is not always free. When $G$ is the trivial group, we explain how to identify equivariant parametrized cellular cohomology with cellular cohomology in local coefficients. Finally, we illustrate the theory with some new computations of parametrized cellular cohomology for several spaces with $G = C_2$ and $G=C_4$.</description>

      <title>The cyclic bar construction and fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the 0-th Hochschild homology of the associative algebra of simplicial cochains valued in a PID: it consists of the ``finite-type" homotopy invariants of free loops, equivalently finite-type class functions on the fundamental group. One major motivation for this calculation is joint work in progress aiming to geometrically construct invariants of links in the 3-sphere as well as other $3$-manifolds, and to realize Milnor's linking numbers as evaluations of 0-th Hochschild homology classes.</description>

      <title>Character theory and Euler characteristic for orbispaces and infinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a discrete group $G$ with a finite model for $\underline{E}G$, we study $K(n)^*(BG)$ and $E^*(BG)$, where $K(n)$ is the $n$-th Morava $K$-theory for a given prime and $E$ is the height $n$ Morava $E$-theory. In particular we generalize the character theory of Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel who studied these objects for finite groups. We give a formula for a localization of $E^*(BG)$ and the $K(n)$-theoretic Euler characteristic of $BG$ in terms of centralizers. In certain cases these calculations lead to a full computation of $E^*(BG)$, for example when $G$ is a right angled Coxeter group, and for $G=SL_3(\mathbb{Z})$. We apply our results to the mapping class group $\Gamma_\frac{p-1}{2}$ for an odd prime $p$ and to certain arithmetic groups, including the symplectic group $Sp_{p-1}(\mathbb{Z})$ for an odd prime $p$ and $SL_2(\mathcal{O}_K)$ for a totally real field $K$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>

      <title>xPerT: Extended Persistence Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A persistence diagram provides a compact summary of persistent homology, which captures the topological features of a space at different scales. However, due to its nature as a set, incorporating it as a feature into a machine learning framework is challenging. Several methods have been proposed to use persistence diagrams as input for machine learning models, but they often require complex preprocessing steps and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer architecture called the \textit{Extended Persistence Transformer (xPerT)}, which is highly scalable than the compared to Persformer, an existing transformer for persistence diagrams. xPerT reduces GPU memory usage by over 90\% and improves accuracy on multiple datasets. Additionally, xPerT does not require complex preprocessing steps or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it easy to use in practice.

      <title>Morse Sequences: A simple approach to discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the notion of a Morse sequence, which provides an alternative approach to discrete Morse theory, and which is both simple and effective. A Morse sequence on a finite simplicial complex is a sequence composed solely of two elementary operations, that is, expansions (the inverse of a collapse), and fillings (the inverse of a perforation). In a dual manner, a Morse sequence may be obtained by considering only collapses and perforations. Such a sequence is another way to represent the gradient vector field of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we assign a reference map and an extension map. A reference map associates a set of critical simplexes to each simplex of a given complex, and an extension map associates a set of simplexes to each critical simplex. By considering the boundary of each critical simplex, we obtain a chain complex from these maps, which corresponds precisely to the Morse complex. We show that, when restricted to homology, an extension map is the inverse of a reference map. Also we show that these two maps allow us to recover directly the isomorphism theorem between the homology of an object and the homology of its Morse complex. At last, we introduce the notion of a flow complex, which is based solely on extension maps. We prove that this notion is equivalent to the classical one based on gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Cofibrantly generated model structures for functor calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model structures for many different kinds of functor calculus can be obtained by applying a theorem of Bousfield to a suitable category of functors. In this paper, we give a general criterion for when model categories obtained via this approach are cofibrantly generated. Our examples recover the homotopy functor and $n$-excisive model structures of Biedermann and R\"ondigs, with different proofs, but also include a model structure for the discrete functor calculus of Bauer, Johnson, and McCarthy.</description>

      <title>The special unitary groups $SU(2n)$ as framed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $[SU(2n),\mathscr{L}]$ denote the bordism class of $SU(2n)$ $(n\ge 2)$ equipped with the left invariant framing $\mathscr{L}$. Then it is well known that $e_\mathbb{C}([SU(2n), \mathscr{L}])=0$ in $\mathbb{O}/\mathbb{Z}$ where $e_\mathbb{C}$ denotes the complex Adams $e$-invariant. In this note we show that replacing $\mathscr{L}$ by the twisted framing by a specific map it can be transformed into a generator of $\mathrm{Im} \, e_\mathbb{C}$. In addition to that we also show that the same procedure affords an analogous result for a quotient of $SU(2n+1)$ by a circle subgroup which inherits a canonical framing from $SU(2n+1)$ in the usual way.</description>

      <title>Boosting Graph Pooling with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been an emerging trend to integrate persistent homology (PH) into graph neural networks (GNNs) to enrich expressive power. However, naively plugging PH features into GNN layers always results in marginal improvement with low interpretability. In this paper, we investigate a novel mechanism for injecting global topological invariance into pooling layers using PH, motivated by the observation that filtration operation in PH naturally aligns graph pooling in a cut-off manner. In this fashion, message passing in the coarsened graph acts along persistent pooled topology, leading to improved performance. Experimentally, we apply our mechanism to a collection of graph pooling methods and observe consistent and substantial performance gain over several popular datasets, demonstrating its wide applicability and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Segal K-theory of vector spaces with an automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the Segal $K$-theory of the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a perfect field $\mathbb{F}$ together with an automorphism, or, equivalently, the group-completion of the $E_\infty$-algebra of maps from $S^1$ to the disjoint union of classifying spaces $\mathrm{BGL}_d(\mathbb F)$, in terms of the $K$-theory of finite field extensions of $\mathbb{F}$. A key ingredient for this is a computation of the Segal $K$-theory of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with a nilpotent endomorphism, which we do over any field $\mathbb F$. We also discuss the topological cases of $\mathbb F =\mathbb C,\mathbb R$.</description>
