      <title>Topological Data Analysis via Undergraduate Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis has grown in popularity in recent years as a way to apply tools from algebraic topology to large data sets. One of the main tools in topological data analysis is persistent homology. This paper uses undergraduate linear algebra to provide explicit methods for, and examples of, computing persistent (co)homology.</description>

      <title>Parametrized topological complexity of spherical fibrations over spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrized topological complexity is a homotopy invariant that represents the degree of instability of motion planning problem that involves external constraints. We consider the parametrized topological complexity in the case of spherical fibrations over spheres. We explicitly compute a lower bound in terms of weak category and determine the parametrized topological complexity of some spherical fibrations.</description>

      <title>The Topological Behavior of Preferential Attachment Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the higher-order connectivity of scale-free networks using algebraic topology. We model scale-free networks as preferential attachment graphs, and we study the algebraic-topological properties of their clique complexes. We focus on the Betti numbers and the homotopy-connectedness of these complexes. We determine the asymptotic almost sure orders of magnitude of the Betti numbers. We also establish the occurence of homotopical phase transitions for the infinite complexes, and we determine the critical thresholds at which the homotopy-connectivity changes. This partially verifies Weinberger's conjecture on the homotopy type of the infinite complexes. We conjecture that the mean-normalized Betti numbers converge to power-law distributions, and we present numerical evidence. Our results also highlight the subtlety of the scaling limit of topology, which arises from the tension between topological operations and analytical limiting process. We discuss such tension at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <title>Chromatic congruences and Bernoulli numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every natural number $n$ and a fixed prime $p$, we prove a new congruence for the orbifold Euler characteristic of a group. The $p$-adic limit of these congruences as $n$ tends to infinity recovers the Brown-Quillen congruence. We apply these results to mapping class groups and using the Harer-Zagier formula we obtain a family of congruences for Bernoulli numbers. We show that these congruences in particular recover classical congruences for Bernoulli numbers due to Kummer, Voronoi, Carlitz, and Cohen.</description>

      <title>A New Algorithm for Whitney Stratification of Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new algorithm to compute Whitney stratifications of real and complex algebraic varieties. This algorithm is a modification of the algorithm of Helmer and Nanda (HN), but is made more efficient by using techniques for equidimensional decomposition rather than computing the set of associated primes of a polynomial ideal at a key step in the HN algorithm. We note that this modified algorithm may fail to produce a minimal Whitney stratification even when the HN algorithm would produce a minimal stratification. We, additionally, present an algorithm to coarsen any Whitney stratification of a complex variety to a minimal Whitney stratification; the theoretical basis for our approach is a classical result of Teissier.</description>

      <title>Fusion inequality for quadratic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical simplicial cohomology on a simplicial complex G deals with functions on simplices x in G. Quadratic cohomology deals with functions on pairs of simplices (x,y) in G x G that intersect. If K,U is a closed-open pair in G, we prove here a quadratic version of the linear fusion inequality. Additional to the quadratic cohomology of G there are five additional interaction cohomology groups. Their Betti numbers are computed from functions on pairs (x,y) of simplices that intersect. Define the Betti vector b(X) computed from pairs (x,y) in X x X with x intersected y in X a and b(X,Y) with pairs in X xY with x intersected y in K. We prove the fusion inequality b(G) &lt;= b(K)+b(U)+b(K,U)+b(U,K)+b(U,U) for cohomology groups linking all five possible interaction cases. Counting shows f(G) = f(K)+f(U) + f(K,U)+f(U,K)+f(U,U) for the f-vectors. Super counting gives Euler-Poincare sum_k (-1)^k f_k(X)=\sum_k (-1)^k b_k(X) and sum_k (-1)^k f_k(X,Y)=sum_k (-1)^k b_k(X,Y) for X,Y in {U,K}. As in the linear case, also the proof of the quadratic fusion inequality follows from the fact that the spectra of all the involved Laplacians L(X),L(X,Y) are bounded above by the spectrum of the quadratic Hodge Laplacian L(G) of G.</description>

      <title>Optimal partial transport for metric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study Figalli and Gigli's formulation of optimal transport between non-negative Radon measures in the setting of metric pairs. We carry over classical characterisations of optimal plans to this setting and prove that the resulting spaces of measures, $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, are complete, separable and geodesic whenever the underlying space, $X$, is so. We also prove that, for $p&gt;1$, $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$ preserves the property of being non-branching, and for $p=2$ it preserves non-negative curvature in the Alexandrov sense. Finally, we prove isometric embeddings of generalised spaces of persistence diagrams $\mathcal{D}_p(X,A)$ into the corresponding spaces $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, generalising a result by Divol and Lacombe. As an application of this framework, we show that several known geometric properties of spaces of persistence diagrams follow from those of $\mathcal{M}_p(X,A)$, including the fact that $\mathcal{D}_2(X,A)$ is an Alexandrov space of non-negative curvature whenever $X$ is a proper non-negatively curved Alexandrov space.</description>

      <title>On the extension problems for three 33-stem homotopy groups and unstable matrix Toda brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper first tackles the extension problems for the far-unsatble homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the puzzles having remained unsolved for forty-five years. Then we give an unstable approach of the May-Lawrences matrix Toda bracket, which becomes a useful tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups.</description>
