      <title>Impact of Rankings and Personalized Recommendations in Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals often navigate several options with incomplete knowledge of their own preferences. Information provisioning tools such as public rankings and personalized recommendations have become central to helping individuals make choices, yet their value proposition under different marketplace environments remains unexplored. This paper studies a stylized model to explore the impact of these tools in two marketplace settings: uncapacitated supply, where items can be selected by any number of agents, and capacitated supply, where each item is constrained to be matched to a single agent. We model the agents utility as a weighted combination of a common term which depends only on the item, reflecting the item's population level quality, and an idiosyncratic term, which depends on the agent item pair capturing individual specific tastes. Public rankings reveal the common term, while personalized recommendations reveal both terms. In the supply unconstrained settings, both public rankings and personalized recommendations improve welfare, with their relative value determined by the degree of preference heterogeneity. Public rankings are effective when preferences are relatively homogeneous, while personalized recommendations become critical as heterogeneity increases. In contrast, in supply constrained settings, revealing just the common term, as done by public rankings, provides limited benefit since the total common value available is limited by capacity constraints, whereas personalized recommendations, by revealing both common and idiosyncratic terms, significantly enhance welfare by enabling agents to match with items they idiosyncratically value highly. These results illustrate the interplay between supply constraints and preference heterogeneity in determining the effectiveness of information provisioning tools, offering insights for their design and deployment in diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Correlated equilibrium implementation: Navigating toward social optima with learning dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementation theory has made significant advances in characterizing which social choice functions can be implemented in Nash equilibrium, but these results typically assume sophisticated strategic reasoning by agents. However, evidence exists to show that agents frequently cannot perform such reasoning. In this paper, we present a finite mechanism which fully implements Maskin-monotonic social choice functions as the outcome of the unique correlated equilibrium of the induced game. Due to the results in Hart and MasColell (2000), this yields that even when agents use a simple adaptive heuristic like regret minimization rather than computing equilibrium strategies, the designer can expect to implement the SCF correctly. We demonstrate the mechanism's effectiveness through simulations in a bilateral trade environment, where agents using regret matching converge to the desired outcomes despite having no knowledge of others' preferences or the equilibrium structure. The mechanism does not use integer games or modulo games.</description>

      <title>How urban scaling and resource distribution shape social welfare and migration dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many outputs of cities scale in universal ways, including infrastructure, crime, and economic activity. Through a mathematical model, this study investigates the interplay between such scaling laws in human organization and governmental allocations of resources, focusing on impacts to migration patterns and social welfare. We find that if superlinear scaling resources of cities -- such as economic and social activity -- are the primary drivers of city dwellers' utility, then cities tend to converge to similar sizes and social welfare through migration. In contrast, if sublinear scaling resources, such as infrastructure, primarily impact utility, then migration tends to lead to megacities and inequity between large and small cities. These findings have implications for policymakers, economists, and political scientists addressing the challenges of equitable and efficient resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Complexity and Manipulation of International Kidney Exchange Programmes with Country-Specific Parameterss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kidney Exchange Programmes (KEPs) facilitate the exchange of kidneys, and larger pools of recipient-donor pairs tend to yield proportionally more transplants, leading to the proposal of international KEPs (IKEPs). However, as studied by \citet{mincu2021ip}, practical limitations must be considered in IKEPs to ensure that countries remain willing to participate. Thus, we study IKEPs with country-specific parameters, represented by a tuple $\Gamma$, restricting the selected transplants to be feasible for the countries to conduct, e.g., imposing an upper limit on the number of consecutive exchanges within a country's borders. We provide a complete complexity dichotomy for the problem of finding a feasible (according to the constraints given by $\Gamma$) cycle packing with the maximum number of transplants, for every possible $\Gamma$. We also study the potential for countries to misreport their parameters to increase their allocation. As manipulation can harm the total number of transplants, we propose a novel individually rational and incentive compatible mechanism $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$. We first give a theoretical approximation ratio for $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ in terms of the number of transplants, and show that the approximation ratio of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is asymptotically optimal. We then use simulations which suggest that, in practice, the performance of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{order}}$ is significantly better than this worst-case ratio.</description>

      <title>A primal-dual price-optimization method for computing equilibrium prices in mean-field games models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.</description>

      <title>Market Design with Distributional Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide optimal solutions to an institution that has distributional objectives when choosing from a set of applications based on merit (or priority). For example, in college admissions, administrators may want to admit a diverse class in addition to choosing students with the highest qualifications. We provide a family of choice rules that maximize merit subject to attaining a level of the distributional objective. We study the desirable properties of choice rules in this family and use them to find all subsets of applications on the Pareto frontier of the distributional objective and merit. In addition, we provide two novel characterizations of matroids.</description>

      <title>Information Aggregation with Costly Information Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information aggregation in a dynamic trading model with partially informed traders. Ostrovsky [2012] showed that 'separable' securities aggregate information in all equilibria, however, separability is not robust to small changes in the traders' private information. To remedy this problem, we enhance the model by allowing traders to acquire signals with cost $\kappa$, in every period. We show that '$\kappa$ separable securities' aggregate information and, as the cost decreases, nearly all securities become $\kappa$ separable, irrespective of the traders' initial private information. Moreover, the switch to $\kappa$ separability happens not gradually but discontinuously, hence even a small decrease in costs can result in a security aggregating information. Finally, even with myopic traders, cheaper information may accelerate or decelerate information aggregation for all but Arrow-Debreu securities.</description>

      <title>Human Misperception of Generative-AI Alignment: A Laboratory Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. We find that people overestimate the degree of alignment between GenAI's choices and human choices. In every problem, human subjects' average prediction about GenAI's choice is substantially closer to the average human-subject choice than it is to the GenAI choice. At the individual level, different subjects' predictions about GenAI's choice in a given problem are highly correlated with their own choices in the same problem. We explore the implications of people overestimating GenAI alignment in a simple theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Limited attention and models of choice: A behavioral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that many models of choice can be alternatively represented as special cases of choice with limited attention (Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay, 2012), singling out the properties of the unobserved attention filters that explain the observed choices.For each specification, information about the DM's consideration sets and preference is inferred from violations of the contraction consistency axiom, and it is compared with the welfare indications obtained from equivalent models. Remarkably, limited attention always supports the elicitation of DM's taste arising from alternative methods. Finally, we examine the intersections between subclasses, and we verify that each of them is independent of the others.</description>
