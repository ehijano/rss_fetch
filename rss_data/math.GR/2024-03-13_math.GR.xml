      <title>Generalizations of the Bassian and co-Bassian Properties for Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trying to finalize in some way the present subject, this paper targets to generalize substantially the notions of Bassian and co-Bassian groups by introducing the so-called finitely (co-)Bassian groups, semi (co-)Bassian groups, fully generalized (co-)Bassian groups, absolutely generalized (co-)Bassian groups and establishing their crucial properties and characterizations. In fact, some of the concepts give nothing new by coinciding in the reduced case with the well-known (co-)Bassian property. However, in some of the definitions, the situation is slightly more complicated and we obtain a few new and interesting things by showing that the extensions of the Bassian and co-Bassian properties are totally distinct each other.</description>

      <title>Solvabilizer Numbers of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a nonsolvable finite group G, where R(G) represents the solvable radical of G. For any element x in G, the solvabilizer of x in G, denoted by Sol_G(x), is defined as the set of all elements y in G such that the subgroup generated by x and y is solvable. Notably, the entirety of G can be expressed as the union over all x in G\R(G) of their respective solvabilizers: $G = \cup_{x\in G\R(G)} Sol_G(x). A solvabilizer covering of G is characterized by a subset X of G\R(G) such that G= \cup_{x\in X} Sol_G(x). The solvabilizer number of G is then defined as the minimum cardinality among all solvabilizer coverings of G. This paper delves into the exploration of the solvabilizer number for diverse nonsolvable finite groups G, shedding light on the interplay between solvability and the structure of these groups.</description>

      <title>A classification of $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-braces using bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ be a finite field of odd characteristic $p$. In this paper we give a classification, up to isomorphism, of the associative commutative $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$-algebras such that the resulting ring is radical, starting from the connection with their bi-brace structure. Such classification is the generalization in odd characteristic of the result proved by Civino at al. in characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>Random Groups are not $n$-Cubulated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ has $F\mathcal C_n$ if every action on a $n$-dimensional $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex has a global fixed point. This provides a natural stratification between Serre's $FA$ and Kazhdan's $(T)$. For every $n$, we show that random groups in the plain words density model have $F\mathcal C_n$ with overwhelming probability. The same result holds for random groups in the reduced words density model assuming there are sufficiently many generators. These are the first examples of cubulated hyperbolic groups with $F\mathcal C_n$ for $n$ arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>The algebraic structure of hyperbolic graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genevois has recently classified which graph braid groups on $\ge 3$ strands are word hyperbolic. In the $3$-strand case, he asked whether all such word hyperbolic groups are actually free; this reduced to checking two infinite classes of graphs. We give positive and negative answers to this question: one class of graphs always has free $3$-strand braid group, while the braid groups in the other class usually contain surface subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all integers $p&gt;q&gt;0$ and $k &gt;0$, and all non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic groups $H$, we construct a hyperbolic group $G$ in which $H$ is a subgroup, such that the distortion function of $H$ in $G$ grows like $\exp^k(n^{p/q})$. Here, $\exp^k$ denotes the $k$-fold-iterated exponential function.</description>

      <title>On conjugacy and perturbation of subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy orbits of certain types of subalgebras in tracial von Neumann algebras. For any separable II$_1$ factor $N_0$ we construct a highly indecomposable non Gamma II$_1$ factor $N$ such that $N_0 \subset N$ and moreover every von Neumann subalgebra of $N$ with Haagerup's property admits a unique embedding up to unitary conjugation. Such a factor necessarily has to be non separable, but we show that it can be taken of density character $2^{\aleph_0}$. On the other hand we are able to construct for any separable II$_1$ factor $M_0$, a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ containing $M_0$ such that every property (T) subfactor admits a unique embedding into $M$ up to uniformly approximate unitary equivalence; i.e., any pair of embeddings can be conjugated up to a small uniform $2$-norm perturbation.</description>

      <title>On groups with large verbal quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $w=w(x_1,...,x_n)$ be a word, i.e. an element of the free group $F = \langle x_1,...,x_n \rangle$. The verbal subgroup $w(G)$ of a group $G$ is the subgroup generated by the set $\{ w(x_1,...,x_n) : x_1,...,x_n \in G \}$ of all $w$-values in $G$. Following J. Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez and B. Klopsch, a group $G$ is $w$-maximal if $|H:w(H)| &lt; |G:w(G)|$ for every $H&lt;G$. In this paper we give new results on $w$-maximal groups, and study the weaker condition in which the previous inequality is not strict. Some applications are given: for example, if a finite group has a solvable (resp. nilpotent) section of size $n$, then it has a solvable (resp. nilpotent) subgroup of size at least $n$.</description>

      <title>Patterson-Sullivan measures for transverse subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Patterson-Sullivan measures for a class of discrete subgroups of higher rank semisimple Lie groups, called transverse groups, whose limit set is well-defined and transverse in a partial flag variety. This class of groups includes both Anosov and relatively Anosov groups, as well as all discrete subgroups of rank one Lie groups. We prove an analogue of the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy and then use this dichotomy to prove a variant of Burger's Manhattan curve theorem. We also use the Patterson-Sullivan measures to obtain conditions for when a subgroup has critical exponent strictly less than the original transverse group. These gap results are new even for Anosov groups.</description>

      <title>On the maximal overgroups of Sylow subgroups of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the finite groups with a Sylow $r$-subgroup contained in a unique maximal subgroup. The proof involves a reduction to almost simple groups, and our main theorem extends earlier work of Aschbacher in the special case $r=2$. Several applications are presented. This includes some new results on weakly subnormal subgroups of finite groups, which can be used to study variations of the Baer-Suzuki theorem.</description>

      <title>The Space of Traces of the Free Group and Free Products of Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the space of traces of the free group $F_d$ on $2\leq d \leq \infty $ generators is a Poulsen simplex, i.e., every trace is a pointwise limit of extreme traces. This fails for many virtually free groups. The same result holds for free products of the form $C(X_1)*C(X_2)$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are compact metrizable spaces without isolated points. Using a similar strategy, we show that the space of traces of the free product of matrix algebras $M_n(\mathbb{C}) * M_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a Poulsen simplex as well, answering a question of Musat and R\ordam for $n \geq 4$. Similar results are shown for certain faces of the simplices above, such as the face of finite-dimensional traces or amenable traces.</description>

      <title>Groups of profinite type and profinite rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a group $G$ is of \textit{profinite type} if it can be realized as a Galois group of some field extension. Using Krull's theory, this is equivalent to the ability of $G$ to be equipped with a profinite topology. We also say that a group of profinite type is \textit{profinitely rigid} if it admits a unique profinite topology. In this paper we study when abelian groups and some group extensions are of profinite type or profinitely rigid. We also discuss the connection between the properties of profinite type and profinite rigidity to the injectivity and surjectivity of the cohomology comparison maps, which were studied by Sury and other authors.</description>

      <title>Spectral reconstruction and representations of finitely generated groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that characters classify linear representations of finite groups, that is if characters of two representations of a finite group are the same, these representations are equivalent. It is also well-known that, in general, this is not true for representations of infinite groups, even if they are finitely generated. The goal of this paper is to establish a characterization of representations of finitely generated groups in terms of projective joint spectra. This approach has a clear advantage compared to character classification as it is valid for a much wider family of groups and for both finite and infinite dimensional representations. The main tool in establishing our spectral characterization is a reconstruction of an operator acting on a separable Hilbert space from the proper projective joint spectrum of the quadruple containing this operator along with a certain triple of bounded operators acting on the same space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.08827v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of compact geodesic spaces with trivial first Betti number admitting large finite groups of isometries. We show that if a finite group $G$ acts by isometries on a compact geodesic space $X$ whose first Betti number vanishes, then diam$(X) / $diam$(X / G ) \leq 4 \sqrt{ \vert G \vert }$.
  For a group $G$ and a finite symmetric generating set $S$, $P_k(\Gamma (G, S))$ denotes the 2-dimensional CW-complex whose 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ of $G$ with respect to $S$ and whose 2-cells are $m$-gons for $0 \leq m \leq k$, defined by the simple graph loops of length $m$ in $\Gamma$, up to cyclic permutations.
  Let $G$ be a finite abelian group with $\vert G \vert \geq 3$ and $S$ a symmetric set of generators for which $P_k(\Gamma (G,S))$ has trivial first Betti number. We show that the first nontrivial eigenvalue $-\lambda_1$ of the Laplacian on the Cayley graph satisfies $\lambda_1 \geq 2 - 2 \cos ( 2 \pi / k ) $. We also give an explicit upper bound on the diameter of the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to $S$ of the form $O (k^2 \vert S \vert \log \vert G \vert )$. Related explicit bounds for the Cheeger constant and Kazhdan constant of the pair $(G,S)$ are also obtained.</description>
