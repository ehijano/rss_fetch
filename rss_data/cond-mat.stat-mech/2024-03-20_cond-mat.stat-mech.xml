      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG).</description>

      <title>Deformation of power law in the double Pareto distribution using uniformly distributed observation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double Pareto distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a power-law tail, that is generated via geometric Brownian motion with an exponentially distributed observation time. In this study, we examine a modified model wherein the exponential distribution of the observation time is replaced with a continuous uniform distribution. The probability density, complementary cumulative distribution, and moments of this model are exactly calculated. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical calculations is discussed in comparison with numerical simulations of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of thermal variables investigated by cross-correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in conjugate thermodynamic variables are studied using the cross-correlation function. A new procedure is given enabling the derivation of fluctuation formulas for a system in equilibrium. Specifically, the cross-correlation function between heat and temperature is employed for thermal variables. Additionally, fluctuation-dissipation relations involving the frequency-dependent specific heat are established. Moreover, a general relation concerning the average entropy production is also given, which is the microscopic analogue of the dissipation formula of the linear response theory. In the case of thermal variables, this formula finds application in various scenarios describing fluctuating thermal systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Exploring Conformational Landscapes Along Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to automatize the identification of collective variables to simplify and speed up enhanced sampling simulations of conformational dynamics in biomolecules. We focus on anharmonic low-frequency vibrations that exhibit fluctuations on timescales faster than conformational transitions but describe a path of least resistance towards structural change. A key challenge is that harmonic approximations are ill-suited to characterize these vibrations, which are observed at far-infrared frequencies and are easily excited by thermal collisions at room temperature.
  Here, we approached this problem with a frequency-selective anharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis that does not rely on harmonic approximations and successfully isolates anharmonic low-frequency vibrations from short molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. We applied FRESEAN mode analysis to simulations of alanine dipeptide, a common test system for enhanced sampling simulation protocols, and compare the performance of isolated low-frequency vibrations to conventional user-defined collective variables (here backbone dihedral angles) in enhanced sampling simulations.
  The comparison shows that enhanced sampling along anharmonic low-frequency vibrations not only reproduces known conformational dynamics but can even further improve sampling of slow transitions compared to user-defined collective variables. Notably, free energy surfaces spanned by low-frequency anharmonic vibrational modes exhibit lower barriers associated with conformational transitions relative to representations in backbone dihedral space. We thus conclude that anharmonic low-frequency vibrations provide a promising path for highly effective and fully automated enhanced sampling simulations of conformational dynamics in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Exact thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains at infinite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We introduce a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <title>Chiral-symmetric Topological Origin of Nonlinear Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain un-studied in systems with nonlinear interactions that are beyond Kerr-type. Here, we establish these two non-spatial symmetries in systems with strong and general nonlinear interactions. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show edge modes that serve as topologically protected fixed points of chiral-symmetric nonlinear dynamics. Our theoretical framework paves the way towards the topological classification of general nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIS process on a graph poses many challenges. An important problem is to identify characteristics of the metastable behaviour. Existing mean-field methods (such as Heterogeneous Mean Field and the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation) overestimate the metastable infected fraction, because they ignore correlations. Especially in sparse graphs, this leads to serious inaccuracies. We propose quenched and annealed methods incorporating correlations and giving significantly more accurate approximations. We use the Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph as a test case, but the methods can be generalized easily. Our methods are computationally very friendly and can be applied to fairly large graphs, in contrast with some other second-order mean field approximations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Leapover Lengths of L\'evy Flights with Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional search process under stochastic resetting conditions. A target is located at $b\geq0$ and a searcher, starting from the origin, performs a discrete-time random walk with independent jumps drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. Before each jump, there is a given probability $r$ of restarting the walk from the initial position. The efficiency of a "myopic search" - in which the search stops upon crossing the target for the first time - is usually characterized in terms of the first-passage time $\tau$. On the other hand, great relevance is encapsulated by the leapover length $l = x_{\tau} - b$, which measures how far from the target the search ends. For symmetric heavy-tailed jump distributions, in the absence of resetting the average leapover is always infinite. Here we show instead that resetting induces a finite average leapover $\ell_b(r)$ if the mean jump length is finite. We compute exactly $\ell_b(r)$ and determine the condition under which resetting allows for nontrivial optimization, i.e., for the existence of $r^*$ such that $\ell_b(r^*)$ is minimal and smaller than the average leapover of the single jump.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling critical behavior in three-dimensional lattice Abelian gauge models with charged $N$-component scalar fields and $SO(N)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a three-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs gauge model for a charged $N$-component scalar field ${\phi}$, which is invariant under $SO(N)$ global transformations for generic values of the parameters. We focus on the strong-coupling regime, in which the kinetic Hamiltonian term for the gauge field is a small perturbation, which is irrelevant for the critical behavior. The Hamiltonian depends on a parameter $v$ which determines the global symmetry of the model and the symmetry of the low-temperature phases. We present renormalization-group predictions, based on a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective description that relies on the identification of the appropriate order parameter and on the symmetry-breaking patterns that occur at the strong-coupling phase transitions. For $v=0$, the global symmetry group of the model is $SU(N)$; the corresponding model may undergo continuous transitions only for $N=2$. For $v\not=0$, i.e., in the $SO(N)$ symmetric case, continuous transitions (in the Heisenberg universality class) are possible also for $N=3$ and 4. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for $N=2,3,4,6$, to verify the renormalization-group predictions. Finite-size scaling analyses of the numerical data are in full agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of thin films is typically described using phenomenological models whose connection to the microscopic particle dynamics is a subject of ongoing research. Existing methods based on density functional theory provide a good description of static thin films, but are not sufficient for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. This method allows to directly obtain the correct gradient dynamics structure along with microscopic expressions for the mobility and the free energy. Our results are verified against molecular dynamics simulations for both simple fluids and polymers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the efficiency of principal signal transmission modes in proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is the splay deformation.</description>

      <title>Tangent space generators of matrix product states and exact Floquet quantum scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of quantum simulators motivates the development of a theoretical framework to assist with efficient state preparation in quantum many-body systems. Generally, preparing a target entangled state via unitary evolution with time-dependent couplings is a challenging task and very little is known about the existence of solutions and their properties. In this work we develop a constructive approach for preparing matrix product states (MPS) via continuous unitary evolution. We provide an explicit construction of the operator which exactly implements the evolution of a given MPS along a specified direction in its tangent space. This operator can be written as a sum of local terms of finite range, yet it is in general non-Hermitian. Relying on the explicit construction of the non-Hermitian generator of the dynamics, we demonstrate the existence of a Hermitian sequence of operators that implements the desired MPS evolution with the error which decreases exponentially with the operator range. The construction is benchmarked on an explicit periodic trajectory in a translationally invariant MPS manifold. We demonstrate that the Floquet unitary generating the dynamics over one period of the trajectory features an approximate MPS-like eigenstate embedded among a sea of thermalizing eigenstates. These results show that our construction is useful not only for state preparation and control of many-body systems, but also provides a generic route towards Floquet scars -- periodically driven models with quasi-local generators of dynamics that have exact MPS eigenstates in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Kinetically constrained models constructed from dissipative quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of kinetically constrained models using the Markovian quantum dynamics under strong dissipation. Using the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) formalism, we show that strong dissipation leads to the emergent decoherence-free subspaces, within which constrained quantum many-body unitary dynamics can take place. We argue that the unitary dynamics constructed by the GKSL dynamics is more tightly constrained than that constructed by the strongly interacting Hamiltonian, where the interactions have the same form with the GKSL jump operators. As an example, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin system with two-site dissipation leads to the kinetically constrained ``PXQ" model, which exhibits the free domain-wall motion with an additional frozen-block structure. Under the uniform magnetic field, the PXQ model shows the domain-wall localization, similar to the Wannier-Stark localization. We then couple two PXQ chains with the magnetic field and inter-chain interaction. We discover that, while localization of the domain walls persists despite the interactions for typical parameter regimes, a non-trivial partial delocalization appears for a certain parameter line.</description>

      <title>Two-level systems and harmonic excitations in a mean-field anharmonic quantum glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural glasses display at low temperature a set of anomalies in thermodynamic observables. The prominent example is the linear-in-temperature scaling of the specific heat, at odds with the Debye cubic scaling found in crystals, due to acoustic phonons. Such an excess of specific heat in amorphous solids is thought of arising from phenomenological soft excitations dubbed tunneling two-level systems (TTLS). Their nature as well as their statistical properties remain elusive from a first-principle viewpoint. In this work we investigate the canonically quantized version of the KHGPS model, a mean-field glass model of coupled anharmonic oscillators, across its phase diagram, with an emphasis on the specific heat. The thermodynamics is solved in a semiclassical expansion. We show that in the replica-symmetric region of the model, up to the marginal glass transition line where replica symmetry gets continuously broken, a disordered version of the Debye approximation holds: the specific heat is dominated by harmonic vibrational excitations inducing a power-law scaling at the transition, ruled by random matrix theory. This mechanism generalizes a previous semiclassical argument in the literature. We then study the marginal glass phase where the semiclassical expansion becomes non-perturbative due to the emergence of instantons that overcome disordered Debye behavior. Inside the glass phase, a variational solution to the instanton approach provides the prevailing excitations as TTLS, which generate a linear specific heat. This phase thus hosts a mix of TTLS and harmonic excitations generated by interactions. We finally suggest to go beyond the variational approximation through an analogy with the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Fast event-driven simulations for soft spheres: from dynamics to Laves phase nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) incorporating general inhomogeneous, incompressible, time dependent background flows and inertia, describing externally driven passive colloidal systems out of equilibrium. We start by considering the underlying nonequilibrium Langevin dynamics, including the effect of the local velocity of the surrounding liquid bath, to obtain the nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations governing the evolution of the (coarse--grained) density and velocity fields describing the dynamics of colloids. Additionally, we show both with heuristic arguments, and by numerical solution, that our equations and solutions agree with existing DDFTs in the overdamped (high friction) limit. We provide numerical solutions that model the flow of hard spheres, in both unbounded and confined domains, and compare to previously--derived DDFTs with and without the background flow.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decade, dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have emerged as a paradigm shift in understanding nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. However, the challenge lies in identifying order parameters that effectively characterize the associated dynamic phases. In this study, we investigate the behavior of vortex singularities in the phase of the Green's function for a broad class of fermion lattice models in three dimensions after an instantaneous quench in both interacting and non-interacting systems. We find that the full set of vortices form one-dimensional dynamical objects, which we call \emph{vortex loops}. We propose that the number of such vortex loops can be interpreted as a quantized order parameter that distinguishes between different non-equilibrium phases. Our results establish an explicit link between variations in the order parameter and DQPTs in the non-interacting scenario. Moreover, we show that the vortex loops are robust in the weakly interacting case, even though there is no direct relation between the Loschmidt amplitude and the Green's function. Finally, we observe that vortex loops can form complex dynamical patterns in momentum space. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing definitions of dynamical order parameters in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation corrections to Lifshitz tails in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14785</link>

Abstract: Quenched disorder in semiconductors induces localized electronic states at the band edge, which manifest as an exponential tail in the density of states. For large impurity densities, this tail takes a universal Lifshitz form that is characterized by short-ranged potential fluctuations. We provide both analytical expressions and numerical values for the Lifshitz tail of a parabolic conduction band, including its exact fluctuation prefactor. Our analysis is based on a replica field integral approach, where the leading exponential scaling of the tail is determined by an instanton profile, and fluctuations around the instanton determine the subleading pre-exponential factor. This factor contains the determinant of a fluctuation operator, and we avoid a full computation of its spectrum by using a Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism, which provides a concise general derivation of fluctuation corrections in disorder problems. We provide a revised result for the disorder band tail in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Work statistics at first-passage times</title>

Abstract: We investigate the work fluctuations in an overdamped non-equilibrium process that is stopped at a stochastic time. The latter is characterized by a first passage event that marks the completion of the non-equilibrium process. In particular, we consider a particle diffusing in one dimension in the presence of a time-dependent potential $U(x,t) = k |x-vt|^n/n$, where $k&gt;0$ is the stiffness and $n&gt;0$ is the order of the potential. Moreover, the particle is confined between two absorbing walls, located at $L_{\pm}(t) $, that move with a constant velocity $v$ and are initially located at $L_{\pm}(0) = \pm L$. As soon as the particle reaches any of the boundaries, the process is said to be completed and here, we compute the work done $W$ by the particle in the modulated trap upto this random time. Employing the Feynman-Kac path integral approach, we find that the typical values of the work scale with $L$ with a crucial dependence on the order $n$. While for $n&gt;1$, we show that $\mom{W} \sim L^{1-n}~\exp \left[ \left( {k L^{n}}/{n}-v L \right)/D \right] $ for large $L$, we get an algebraic scaling of the form $\mom{W} \sim L^n$ for the $n&lt;1$ case. The marginal case of $n=1$ is exactly solvable and our analysis unravels three distinct scaling behaviours: (i) $\mom{W} \sim L$ for $v&gt;k$, (ii) $\mom{W} \sim L^2$ for $v=k$ and (iii) $\mom{W} \sim \exp\left[{-(v-k)L}\right]$ for $v&lt;k$. For all cases, we also obtain the probability distribution associated with the typical values of $W$. Finally, we observe an interesting set of relations between the relative fluctuations of the work done and the first-passage time for different $n$ -- which we argue physically. Our results are well supported by the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transition in a 2D Ferromagnetic Spins with Effective Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium phase transitions in a 2D ferromagnetic Ising model on a square lattice with effective interactions using Monte Carlo-based computational algorithms. We verify the effective parameter $h$ by employing mean-field theory and derive self-consistent equations (SCEs) using two familiar dynamics: Metropolis and Glauber. For $-1&lt;h&lt;1$, both dynamics are expected to estimate the same SCE. We find the relation between $T_{c}$ and $T_{c}^{0}$ where $T_{c}$ ($T_{c}^{0}$) is the critical temperature of the model with (without) the effective interactions. Here, $T_{c}^{0}$ refers to the well-known analytical result of the equilibrium Ising model. We perform the simulations for different lattice sizes that enable us to measure physical quantities of interest. From numerical data, we determine $T_{c}$ and relevant exponents for various values of $h$ by employing finite-size scaling (FSS). We find that the FSS result of $T_{c}$, which is quite different from $T_{c}^{0}$, is in agreement with that of its analytical result, and the accuracy is good regardless of the types of model. The numerical results of the exponents are consistent with the analytical values of the equilibrium 2D Ising model, which belongs to the same universality class.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition between spin liquid and spin nematics in spin-1 Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides the exactly solvable spin-1/2 Kitaev model, higher spin-$S$ ones, not exactly solvable, are promising playgrounds for researches on the quantum spin liquid as well. One of the main interests in higher spin-S cases is the interplay between the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) and spin nematics. We probe this interplay in a spin-1 model on the honeycomb lattice with competing bilinear-biquadratic and Kitaev interactions. Utilizing the 2D infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS), we map out the phase diagram for the ferro-biquadratic interaction. In the phase diagram, we discover the direct KSL--spin-nematics transitions in the vicinity of pure Kitaev limits. It has been revealed that the ferro KSL exhibits robustness against perturbations from ferro-quadrupolar interactions. Also, the spin-nematic phase is extended to the parameter region near the antiferro-Kitaev limit.</description>

      <title>Topological Defects in Floquet Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Floquet circuit describing the driven Ising chain with topological defects. The corresponding gates include a defect that flips spins as well as the duality defect that explicitly implements the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. The Floquet unitary evolution operator commutes with such defects, but the duality defect is not unitary, as it projects out half the states. We give two applications of these defects. One is to analyze the return amplitudes in the presence of "space-like" defects stretching around the system. We verify explicitly that the return amplitudes are in agreement with the fusion rules of the defects. The second application is to study unitary evolution in the presence of "time-like" defects that implement anti-periodic and duality-twisted boundary conditions. We show that a single unpaired localized Majorana zero mode appears in the latter case. We explicitly construct this operator, which acts as a symmetry of this Floquet circuit. We also present analytic expressions for the entanglement entropy after a single time step for a system of a few sites, for all of the above defect configurations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ions reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes achieve equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall process time, while in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are established within the framework of classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potential of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems. This result is fundamental to allow the development of the equilibrium theory for the evaluation of near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging components within the subsystems matrices can be further determined. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is further discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. Within the framework of the proposed model, interdiffusion equations can be derived from having the boundary condition established by the thermodynamic equilibrium at the near interface. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results.</description>

      <title>Operator size growth in Lindbladian SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of operator size in the Lindbladian SYK model with $q$-body interaction terms and linear jump terms at finite dissipation strength. We compute the operator size as well as its distribution numerically at finite $q$ and analytically at large $q$. With dissipative (productive) jump terms, the size converges to a value smaller (larger) than half the number of Majorana fermions. At weak dissipation, the evolution of operator size displays a quadratic-exponential-plateau behavior. The plateau value is determined by the ratios between the coupling of the interaction and the linear jump term in the large $q$ limit. The operator size distribution remains localized in the finite size region even at late times, contrasting with the unitary case. Moreover, we also derived the time-independent orthogonal basis for operator expansion which exhibits the operator size concentration at finite dissipation. Finally, we observe that the uncertainty relation for operator size growth is saturated at large $q$, leading to a classical dynamics of the operator size growth with dissipation.</description>
