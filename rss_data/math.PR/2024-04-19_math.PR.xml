      <title>Moments of the free Jacobi process: a matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the large size limit of the moment formula derived in \cite{DHS} for the Hermitian Jacobi process at fixed time. In particular, we identify the terms contributing to the limit and show they satisfy a double recurrence relation. We also determine explicitly some of them and revisit a special case relying on Carlitz summation identity for terminating $1$-balanced ${}_4F_3$ functions taken at unity.</description>

      <title>Extinction and survival in inherited sterility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an interacting particle system which models the inherited sterility method. Individuals evolve on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ according to a contact process with parameter $\lambda&gt;0$. With probability $p \in [0,1]$ an offspring is fertile and can give birth to other individuals at rate $\lambda$. With probability $1-p$, an offspring is sterile and blocks the site it sits on until it dies. The goal is to prove that at fixed $\lambda$, the system survives for large enough $p$ and dies out for small enough $p$. The model is not attractive, since an increase of fertile individuals potentially causes that of sterile ones. However, thanks to a comparison argument with attractive models, we are able to answer our question.</description>

      <title>Towards an Approximation Theory of Observable Operator Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observable operator models (OOMs) offer a powerful framework for modelling stochastic processes, surpassing the traditional hidden Markov models (HMMs) in generality and efficiency. However, using OOMs to model infinite-dimensional processes poses significant theoretical challenges. This article explores a rigorous approach to developing an approximation theory for OOMs of infinite-dimensional processes. Building upon foundational work outlined in an unpublished tutorial [Jae98], an inner product structure on the space of future distributions is rigorously established and the continuity of observable operators with respect to the associated 2-norm is proven. The original theorem proven in this thesis describes a fundamental obstacle in making an infinite-dimensional space of future distributions into a Hilbert space. The presented findings lay the groundwork for future research in approximating observable operators of infinite-dimensional processes, while a remedy to the encountered obstacle is suggested.</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization and hydrodynamic limit of non-gradient exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the non-gradient exclusion process, we prove its approximation rate of diffusion matrix/conductivity by local functions. The proof follows the quantitative homogenization theory developed by Armstrong, Kuusi, Mourrat and Smart, while the new challenge here is the hard core constraint of particle number on every site. Therefore, a coarse-grained method is proposed to lift the configuration to a larger space without exclusion, and a gradient coupling between two systems is applied to capture the spatial cancellation. Moreover, the approximation rate of conductivity is uniform with respect to the density via the regularity of the local corrector. As an application, we integrate this result in the work by Funaki, Uchiyama and Yau [IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 77 (1996), pp. 1-40.] and yield a quantitative hydrodynamic limit. In particular, our new approach avoids to show the characterization of closed forms. We also discuss the possible extensions in the presence of disorder on the bonds.</description>

      <title>Push-forward of geometric distributions under Collatz iteration: Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two conjectures are presented. The first, Conjecture 1, is that the pushforward of a geometric distribution on the integers under $n$ Collatz iterates, modulo $2^p$, is usefully close to uniform distribution on the integers modulo $2^p$, if $p/n$ is small enough. Conjecture 2 is that the density is bounded from zero for the incidence of both $0$ and $1$ for the coefficients in the dyadic expansions of $-3^{-\ell }$ on all but an exponentially small set of paths of a geometrically distributed random walk on the two-dimensional array of these coefficients. It is shown that Conjecture 2 implies Conjecture 1. At present, Conjecture 2 is unresolved.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Nash Equilibria of Finite-State Ergodic Markovian Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) model equilibria in games with a continuum of weakly interacting players as limiting systems of symmetric $n$-player games. We consider the finite-state, infinite-horizon problem with ergodic cost. Assuming Markovian strategies, we first prove that any solution to the MFG system gives rise to a $(C/\sqrt{n})$-Nash equilibrium in the $n$-player game. We follow this result by proving the same is true for the strategy profile derived from the master equation. We conclude the main theoretical portion of the paper by establishing a large deviation principle for empirical measures associated with the asymptotic Nash equilibria. Then, we contrast the asymptotic Nash equilibria using an example. We solve the MFG system directly and numerically solve the ergodic master equation by adapting the deep Galerkin method of Sirignano and Spiliopoulos. We use these results to derive the strategies of the asymptotic Nash equilibria and compare them. Finally, we derive an explicit form for the rate functions in dimension two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the long-time dynamics of the subordination process for a range of linear evolution equations, with a special emphasis on the fractional heat equation. By treating inverse subordinators as random time variables and employing the subordination principle to solve forward Kolmogorov equations, we explore the behavior of the solutions over extended periods. We provide a detailed description of the specific classes of subordinators suitable for conducting asymptotic analysis. Our findings not only extend existing research, but also enhance the results previously presented in [9, 10].</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fractional Hardy-H\'enon equation with fractional Brownian noise $$ \partial_t u(t)+(-\Delta)^{\theta/2} u(t)=|x|^{-\gamma} |u(t)|^{p-1}u(t)+\mu \partial_t B^H(t), $$ where $\theta&gt;0$, $p&gt;1$, $\gamma\geq 0$, $\mu \in\mathbb{R}$, and the random forcing $B^H$ is the fractional Brownian motion defined on some complete probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. We obtain the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions under tailored conditions on the parameters of the equation.</description>

      <title>Faster Optimization Through Genetic Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact Genetic Algorithm (cGA), parameterized by its hypothetical population size $K$, offers a low-memory alternative to evolving a large offspring population of solutions. It evolves a probability distribution, biasing it towards promising samples. For the classical benchmark OneMax, the cGA has to two different modes of operation: a conservative one with small step sizes $\Theta(1/(\sqrt{n}\log n))$, which is slow but prevents genetic drift, and an aggressive one with large step sizes $\Theta(1/\log n)$, in which genetic drift leads to wrong decisions, but those are corrected efficiently. On OneMax, an easy hill-climbing problem, both modes lead to optimization times of $\Theta(n\log n)$ and are thus equally efficient.
  In this paper we study how both regimes change when we replace OneMax by the harder hill-climbing problem DynamicBinVal. It turns out that the aggressive mode is not affected and still yields quasi-linear runtime $O(n\cdot polylog (n))$. However, the conservative mode becomes substantially slower, yielding a runtime of $\Omega(n^2)$, since genetic drift can only be avoided with smaller step sizes of $O(1/n)$. We complement our theoretical results with simulations.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the invariant measure of a multidimensional diffusion from noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for estimating the invariant density of a multidimensional diffusion when dealing with high-frequency observations blurred by independent noises. We consider the intermediate regime, where observations occur at discrete time instances $k\Delta_n$ for $k=0,\dots,n$, under the conditions $\Delta_n\to 0$ and $n\Delta_n\to\infty$. Our methodology involves the construction of a kernel density estimator that uses a pre-averaging technique to proficiently remove noise from the data while preserving the analytical characteristics of the underlying signal and its asymptotic properties. The rate of convergence of our estimator depends on both the anisotropic regularity of the density and the intensity of the noise. We establish conditions on the intensity of the noise that ensure the recovery of convergence rates similar to those achievable without any noise. Furthermore, we prove a Bernstein concentration inequality for our estimator, from which we derive an adaptive procedure for the kernel bandwidth selection.</description>

Abstract: In a recent work, Klartag gave an improved version of Lichnerowicz' spectral gap bound for uniformly log-concave measures, which improves on the classical estimate by taking into account the covariance matrix. We analyze the equality cases in Klartag's bound, showing that it can be further improved whenever the measure has no Gaussian factor. Additionally, we give a quantitative improvement for log-concave measures with finite Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Singular-limit analysis of gradient descent with noise injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the limiting dynamics of a large class of noisy gradient descent systems in the overparameterized regime. In this regime the set of global minimizers of the loss is large, and when initialized in a neighbourhood of this zero-loss set a noisy gradient descent algorithm slowly evolves along this set. In some cases this slow evolution has been related to better generalisation properties. We characterize this evolution for the broad class of noisy gradient descent systems in the limit of small step size. Our results show that the structure of the noise affects not just the form of the limiting process, but also the time scale at which the evolution takes place. We apply the theory to Dropout, label noise and classical SGD (minibatching) noise, and show that these evolve on different two time scales. Classical SGD even yields a trivial evolution on both time scales, implying that additional noise is required for regularization. The results are inspired by the training of neural networks, but the theorems apply to noisy gradient descent of any loss that has a non-trivial zero-loss set.</description>

      <title>Decision making in stochastic extensive form I: Stochastic decision forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general theory of stochastic decision forests reconciling two concepts of information flow -- decision trees and refined partitions on the one hand, filtrations from probability theory on the other -- is constructed. The traditional "nature" agent is replaced with a one-shot lottery draw that determines a tree of a given decision forest, while each "personal" agent is equipped with an oracle providing updates on the draw's result and makes partition refining choices adapted to this information. This theory overcomes the incapacity of existing approaches to extensive form theory to capture continuous time stochastic processes like Brownian motion as outcomes of "nature" decision making in particular. Moreover, a class of stochastic decision forests based on paths of action indexed by time is constructed, covering a large fraction of models from the literature and constituting a first step towards an approximation theory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.</description>

Abstract: Branching processes in a random environment are natural generalisations of Galton-Watson processes. In this paper we analyse the asymptotic decay of the survival probability for a sequence of slightly supercritical branching processes in an iid random environment, where the offspring expectation converges from above to $1$. We prove that Haldane's asymptotics, known from classical Galton-Watson processes, turns up again in the random environment case, provided that one stays away from the critical/subcritical regime. A central building block is a connection to and a limit theorem for perpetuities with asymptotically vanishing interest rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a regular transient diffusion, we provide a decomposition of its last passage time to a certain state $\alpha$. This is accomplished by transforming the original diffusion into two diffusions using the occupation time of the area above and below $\alpha$. Based on these two processes, both having a reflecting boundary at $\alpha$, we derive the decomposition formula of the Laplace transform of the last passage time explicitly in a simple form in terms of the Green functions. This formula also leads to the Green function's decomposition formula. As an example, we demonstrate an application of these formulas to a diffusion with two-valued parameters.</description>

Abstract: The notion of tamed Dirichlet space by distributional lower Ricci curvature bounds was proposed by Erbar, Rigoni, Sturm and Tamanini as the Dirichlet space having a weak form of Bakry-\'Emery curvature lower bounds in distribution sense. In this framework, we establish the Littlewood-Paley-Stein inequality for $L^p$-functions and $L^p$-boundedness of $q$-Riesz transforms with $q&gt;1$, which partially generalizes the result by Kawabi-Miyokawa.</description>

      <title>Weak Convergence of Stochastic Integrals on Skorokhod Space in Skorokhod's J1 and M1 Topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the theory of stochastic integral convergence on Skorokhod space, providing a new comprehensive treatment under Skorokhod's J1 and M1 topologies based on a simple and tractable notion of good decompositions for the integrators. Our analysis yields new insights even in the classical J1 setting and addresses the sharpness of various key results. As regards convergence of stochastic integrals in the M1 setting, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we derive useful sufficient conditions. Secondly, we demonstrate the limitations of general weak continuity properties for strictly M1 convergent integrators. Moreover, we provide an important structural result for local martingales on Skorokhod space, showing that their M1 tightness generally implies their J1 tightness. The practicality of our results is illustrated through novel contributions to applications from econometric theory, statistical mechanics, mathematical finance, and insurance mathematics.</description>

      <title>Functional weak convergence of stochastic integrals for moving averages and continuous-time random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is by now an extensive theory of weak convergence for moving averages and continuous-time random walks (CTRWs) with respect to Skorokhod's M1 and J1 topologies. Here we address the fundamental question of how this translates into functional limit theorems, in the M1 or J1 topology, for stochastic integrals driven by these processes. As an important application, we provide weak approximation results for general SDEs driven by time-changed L\'evy processes. Such SDEs and their associated fractional Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations are central to models of anomalous diffusion in statistical physics. Our results yield a rigorous functional characterisation of these as continuum limits of the underlying models driven by CTRWs. In regard to strictly M1 convergent moving averages and correlated CTRWs, it turns out that the convergence of stochastic integrals can fail markedly. Nevertheless, we are able to identify natural classes of integrand processes for which M1 convergence holds. We show that these results are general enough to yield functional limit theorems, in the M1 topology, for certain stochastic delay differential equations driven by moving averages.</description>

      <title>On a problem of E. Meckes for the unitary eigenvalue process on an arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem originally communicated by E. Meckes on the asymptotics for the eigenvalues of the kernel of the unitary eigenvalue process of a random $n \times n$ matrix. The eigenvalues $p_{j}$ of the kernel are, in turn, associated with the discrete prolate spheroidal wave functions. We consider the eigenvalue counting function $|G(x,n)|:=\#\{j:p_j&gt;Ce^{-x n}\}$, ($C&gt;0$ here is a fixed constant) and establish the asymptotic behavior of its average over the interval $x \in (\lambda-\varepsilon, \lambda+\varepsilon)$ by relating the function $|G(x,n)|$ to the solution $J(y)$ of the following energy problem on the unit circle $S^{1}$, which is of independent interest. Namely, for given $\theta$, $0&lt;\theta&lt; 2 \pi$, and given $q$, $0&lt;q&lt;1$, we determine the function $J(q) =\inf \{I(\mu): \mu \in \mathcal{P}(S^{1}), \mu(A_{\theta}) = q\}$, where $I(\mu):= \iint \log\frac{1}{|z - \zeta|} d\mu(z) d\mu(\zeta)$ is the logarithmic energy of a probability measure $\mu$ supported on the unit circle and $A_{\theta}$ is the arc from $e^{-i \theta/2}$ to $e^{i \theta/2}$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial interacting particle systems and non-linear SPDEs for market capitalization curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the robustness of the capital distribution curves, we study the behavior of a certain polynomial equity market model as the number of companies goes to infinity. More precisely, we extend volatility-stabilized market models introduced by Fernholz et al. by allowing for a common noise term such that the models remain polynomial. As the number of companies approaches infinity, we show that the limit of the empirical measure of the $N$-company system converges to the unique solution of a degenerate, non-linear SPDE. The obtained limit also has a representation as the conditional probability of the solution to a certain McKean-Vlasov SDE. Together with its conditional, this is again a polynomial process for which we can prove pathwise uniqueness as well as regularity properties for the marginal densities. We also provide conditional propagation of chaos results and numerical implementations of the particle system as well as its limiting equations.</description>

      <title>It\=o and It\=o-Wentzell chain rule for flows of conditional laws of continuous semimartingales: an easy approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a general It\=o\,-Wentzell formula for a random field of maps on the Wasserstein space of probability measures, defined by continuous semimartingales, and evaluated along the flow of conditional distributions of another continuous semimartingale. Our method follows standard arguments of It\=o calculus, and thus bypasses the approximation by empirical measures commonly used in the existing literature. As an application, we derive the dynamic programming equation for a mean field stochastic control problem with common noise.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous upper and lower bounds of American option prices with hedging via neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two methods to solve the American-style option pricing problem and its dual form at the same time using neural networks. Without applying nested Monte Carlo, the first method uses a series of neural networks to simultaneously compute both the lower and upper bounds of the option price, and the second one accomplishes the same goal with one global network. The avoidance of extra simulations and the use of neural networks significantly reduce the computational complexity and allow us to price Bermudan options with frequent exercise opportunities in high dimensions, as illustrated by the provided numerical experiments. As a by-product, these methods also derive a hedging strategy for the option, which can also be used as a control variate for variance reduction.</description>

      <title>Computation of the Distribution of the Absorption Time of the Drifted Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces two techniques for computing the distribution of the first passage or absorption time of a drifted Wiener diffusion with Poisson resetting times, in presence of an upper hard wall reflection and a lower absorbing barrier. The first method starts with the Pad\'e approximation to the Laplace transform of the first passage time, which is then inverted through the partial fraction decomposition. The second method, which we call "multiresolution algorithm", is a Monte Carlo technique that exploits the properties of the Wiener process in order to generate Brownian bridges at increasing resolution levels. This technique allows to approximate the first passage time at any level of accuracy. An intensive numerical study reveals that the multiresolution algorithm has higher accuracy than standard Monte Carlo, whereas the faster method based on the Pad\'e approximation provides sufficient accuracy in specific circumstances only. Besides these two numerical approximations, this article provides a closed-form expression for the expected first passage time.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence of a spatial semidiscretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. For non-smooth initial values, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived with the spatial $ L^2 $-norm. For smooth initial values, two error estimates with the general spatial $ L^q $-norms are established.</description>
