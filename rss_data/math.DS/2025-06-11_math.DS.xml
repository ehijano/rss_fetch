      <title>Chains without regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chain-recurrence and chain-transitivity in compact dynamical systems without any regularity assumptions. We prove that every compact system has a chain-recurrent point and a closed, invariant, chain-transitive subsystem. We also prove that, in fact, the chain-recurrent point whose existence is established is recurrent with respect to a stronger relation than chain-recurrence, which we identify.</description>

      <title>Turing-Turing Bifurcation Analysis and Normal Form in a Predator-Prey Model with Predator-Taxis and Prey Refuge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a predator-prey reaction-diffusion model incorporating predator-taxis and a prey refuge mechanism, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Our primary focus is the analysis of codimension-two Turing-Turing bifurcation and the calculation of its associated normal form for this model. Firstly, employing the maximum principle and Amann's theorem, we rigorously establish the local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. Secondly, utilizing linear stability theory and bifurcation theory, we conduct a thorough analysis of the existence and stability properties of the positive constant steady state. Furthermore, we derive precise conditions under which the model undergoes a Turing-Turing bifurcation. Thirdly, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we rigorously derive the method for calculating the third-truncated normal form characterizing the dynamics near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical findings, confirming the correctness of the analytical results concerning the bifurcation conditions and the derived normal form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected Lie group and $\text{Sub}_G$ be the space of closed subgroups of $G$ equipped with the Chabauty topology. In this article, we investigate the existence of invariant random subgroups of $G$ supported on various orbits of the conjugation action of $G$ on $\text{Sub}_G$. We also find the orbit closure for each of these orbits in the case of the Lie group $G=\SL(2,\mathbb{R})\ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a general rational function $A$ of degree $m \geq 2$, any decomposition of its iterate $A^{\circ n}$, $n \geq 1$, into a composition of indecomposable rational functions is equivalent to the decomposition $A^{\circ n}$ itself. As an application, we prove that if $(A_1, A_2)$ is a general pair of rational functions, then the endomorphism of $\mathbb C\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ given by $(z_1, z_2) \mapsto (A_1(z_1), A_2(z_2))$ admits a periodic curve that is neither a vertical nor a horizontal line if and only if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are conjugate.</description>

      <title>Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of pseudofunction algebras of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Hausdorff, ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ can be completely recovered from the $I$-norm completion of $C_c(\mathcal{G})$. More generally, we show that this is also the case for the algebra of symmetrized $p$-pseudofunctions, as well as for the reduced groupoid $L^p$-operator algebra, for $p\neq 2$.
  Our proofs are based on a new construction of an inverse semigroup built from Moore-Penrose invertible partial isometries in an $L^p$-operator algebra. Along the way, we verify a conjecture of Rako\v{c}evi\'{c} concerning the continuity of the Moore-Penrose inverse for $L^p$-operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Extensive Database of Spatial Ballistic Captures with Application to Lunar Trailblazer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For low-energy missions to the Moon and beyond, Ballistic Capture has proven to be a valuable technique for enabling orbital insertion while alleviating propulsion system requirements. This approach offers two key advantages. First, it extends the insertion window, allowing multiple maneuver opportunities to mitigate potential failures at the nominal insertion point. Second, it enables the required insertion maneuver to be distributed across multiple revolutions, reducing propulsion system constraints in terms of single-burn thrust. Prior research introduced the concept of Energy Transition Domain to support the creation of a comprehensive database of Ballistic Captures in the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, to apply these trajectories to a real mission scenario, a three-dimensional, spatial analysis and transition to an ephemeris model are necessary. This paper first extends the Energy Transition Domain framework to the spatial case, constructing an extensive database of spatial Ballistic Captures. Then, using Lunar Trailblazer as a case study, a subset of the trajectories is filtered using a mission-specific distance metric, and transitioned into an ephemeris model. Finally, interesting features of this subset are analyzed, and sample high-fidelity trajectories are selected as potential backup options for Lunar Trailblazer.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the superpotentials and slices of tropical currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the question of the continuity of slices of currents and explain how it relates to several seemingly unrelated problems in tropical geometry. On the one hand, through this lens, we show that the continuity of superpotentials constitutes a very general instance of stable intersection theory in tropical geometry. On the other hand, questions concerning tropicalisation with respect to a non-trivial valuation and the commutativity of tropicalisation with intersections offer insights to the problem of the continuity of slices of currents converging to a tropical current. Within our framework, we reformulate and reprove known theorems in tropical geometry and derive new results and techniques in both tropical geometry and complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of a subgroup of Aut$(G)$, and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Some of our results extend those of Shah and Yadav.</description>

      <title>A characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies via admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies in terms of the admissibility of certain pairs of weighted spaces for nonautonomous discrete time dynamics acting on Banach spaces. Our general framework enables us to treat various settings in which no similar result has been previously obtained as well as to recover and refine several known results. We emphasize that our results hold without any bounded growth assumption and the statements make no use of Lyapunov norms. Moreover, as a consequence of our characterization, we study the robustness of $(\mu, \nu)$-dichotomies, i.e. we show that this notion persists under small but very general linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Density of Stable Interval Translation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that the interval $I=[0,1)$ is partitioned into finitely many intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$ and consider a map $T\colon I\to I$ so that $T_{\vert I_s}$ is a translation for each $1 \le s \le r$. We do not assume that the images of these intervals are disjoint. Such maps are called Interval Translation Maps. Let $ITM(r)$ be the space of all such transformations, where we fix $r$ but not the intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$, nor the translations. The set $X(T):=\bigcap_{n\ge 0} T^n[0,1)$ can be a finite union of intervals (in which case the map is called of finite type), or is a disjoint union of finitely many intervals and a Cantor set (in which case the map is called of infinite type). In this paper we show that there exists an open and dense subset $\mathcal{S}(r)$ of $ITM(r)$ consisting of stable maps, i.e. each $T\in \mathcal{S}(r)$ is of finite type, the first return map to any component of $X(T)$ corresponds to a circle rotation and $\mathcal{S}(r) \ni T \mapsto X(T)$ is continuous in the Hausdorff topology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the lengths and starting positions of the longest monochromatic arithmetic progressions for a fixed difference in the Fibonacci word. We provide a complete classification for their lengths in terms of a simple formula. Our strongest results are proved using methods from dynamical systems, especially the dynamics of circle rotations. We also employ computer-based methods in the form of the automatic theorem-proving software Walnut. This allows us to extend recent results concerning similar questions for the Thue-Morse word and the Rudin-Shapiro word. This also allows us to obtain some results for the Fibonacci word that do not seem to be amenable to dynamical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets generated by a $C^{1+\alpha}$ conformal IFS on $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying the OSC are exponentially mixing. We exploit this to obtain essentially sharp asymptotic counting statements for the recurrent and the shrinking target subsets associated with any such set. In particular, we provide explicit examples of dynamical systems for which the recurrent sets exhibit (unexpected) behaviour that is not present in the shrinking target setup. In the process of establishing our exponential mixing result we extend Mattila's rigidity theorem for self-similar sets to self-conformal sets without any separation condition and for arbitrary Gibbs measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a topological framework to describe global dynamics under finite-energy perturbations, focusing on escapes from attracting basins, elimination of stagnation, and persistence of recurrent behaviors governed by finite total or stepwise energy. To this end, we introduce generalized concepts of chain recurrence and construct corresponding filtrations for dynamical systems on metric spaces. These filtrations refine Conley's classical theory and enable the quantitative modeling of dynamical behaviors under bounded energy inputs. In particular, we introduce concepts of "coarse chain recurrences" and Morse graphs with finite errors, which yield bifurcation diagrams depicting how chain recurrent components evolve as perturbation scales increase. Our framework also reveals singular limits, where the total injected energy vanishes. The framework applies to both maps and semiflows, providing tools to analyze robustness, sensitivity, and structural evolution of recurrent dynamics. Applications include toy models of flow control and circulation maintained under finite-energy constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the (multiple) fractional cohomological equation and, by studying its solutions, develop a novel framework to obtain the decay of matrix coefficients for partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. In particular, we show that mere partial H\"older regularity of \(L^2\) vectors is sufficient for exponential decay of matrix coefficients.
  As an application, under the assumption of ergodicity, we obtain explicit and sharp exponential mixing rates of all orders for a large class of partially hyperbolic algebraic actions. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of irrational automorphisms on nilmanifolds and prove that these automorphisms exhibit super-exponential mixing of all orders, marking the first such example in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group, the well-known Stability Problem asks whether the non-triviality of the Poisson-Furstenberg boundary (which is equivalent to the existence of non-constant bounded harmonic functions) depends on the choice of simple random walk on the group. This question was far from being understood even in the class of linear groups. Given an amenable group, e.g. a solvable group, there is no known characterisation, even a conjectural one, of when it admits a simple random walk with non-trivial boundary. We provide a characterisation of groups with non-trivial boundary for finitely generated linear groups of characteristic $p$. We prove in particular that the Stability Problem has a positive answer in this class of groups. For linear groups of characteristic $0$, we prove a sufficient condition for the triviality of the boundary which does not depend on the choice of a simple random walk. We conjecture that our sufficient condition is also necessary. Our arguments are based on a new comparison criterion for group extensions, on new $\Delta$-restriction entropy estimates and a criterion for boundary non-triviality, and on a new "cautiousness" criterion for triviality of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Metric-Entropy Limits on the Approximation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with fundamental limits on the approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can approximate nonlinear systems -- that satisfy a Lipschitz property and forget past inputs fast enough -- in metric-entropy-optimal manner. As the sets of sequence-to-sequence mappings realized by the dynamical systems we consider are significantly more massive than function classes generally analyzed in approximation theory, a refined metric-entropy characterization is needed, namely in terms of order, type, and generalized dimension. We compute these quantities for the classes of exponentially- and polynomially Lipschitz fading-memory systems and show that RNNs can achieve them.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating Meta-Learning Optimization Algorithms Through Contextual Self-Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual Self-Modulation (CSM) (Nzoyem et al., 2025) is a potent regularization mechanism for Neural Context Flows (NCFs) which demonstrates powerful meta-learning on physical systems. However, CSM has limitations in its applicability across different modalities and in high-data regimes. In this work, we introduce two extensions: $i$CSM which expands CSM to infinite-dimensional variations by embedding the contexts into a function space, and StochasticNCF which improves scalability by providing a low-cost approximation of meta-gradient updates through a sampled set of nearest environments. These extensions are demonstrated through comprehensive experimentation on a range of tasks, including dynamical systems, computer vision challenges, and curve fitting problems. Additionally, we incorporate higher-order Taylor expansions via Taylor-Mode automatic differentiation, revealing that higher-order approximations do not necessarily enhance generalization. Finally, we demonstrate how CSM can be integrated into other meta-learning frameworks with FlashCAVIA, a computationally efficient extension of the CAVIA meta-learning framework (Zintgraf et al., 2019). Together, these contributions highlight the significant benefits of CSM and indicate that its strengths in meta-learning and out-of-distribution tasks are particularly well-suited to physical systems. Our open-source library, designed for modular integration of self-modulation into contextual meta-learning workflows, is available at https://github.com/ddrous/self-mod.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: a unified approach to Fourier dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov flows on hyperbolic L-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is a hyperbolic L-space with $n$ pseudo-Anosov flows, no two of which are orbit equivalent. These flows have no perfect fits and are thus quasigeodesic. In addition, our flows admit positive Birkhoff sections, which we argue implies that they give rise to $n$ universally tight contact structures whose lifts to any finite cover are non-contactomorphic. This argument involves cylindrical contact homology together with the work of Barthelm\'e, Frankel, and Mann on the reconstruction of pseudo-Anosov flows from their closed orbits. These results answer more general versions of questions posed by Calegari and by Min and Nonino.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Water Treatment through Fractional-Order Chemostat Modeling with Sliding Memory and Periodic Boundary Conditions: A Mathematical Framework for Clean Water and Sanitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the theoretical properties of a fractional-order chemostat system with sliding memory and periodic boundary conditions, used to model the cultivation of microorganisms for pollutant degradation. By incorporating Caputo fractional derivatives with a sliding memory window (CFDS), the model captures time-dependent behaviors and memory effects in biological systems more effectively than integer-order derivatives. We reduce the two-dimensional fractional differential equations (FDEs) governing substrate and biomass concentrations to a one-dimensional FDE, utilizing periodic boundary conditions. The existence and uniqueness of non-constant periodic solutions are established using the Carath\'eodory framework and fixed-point theorems, ensuring the system's well-posedness. We prove the positivity and boundedness of solutions, demonstrating that substrate concentrations remain within physically meaningful bounds and biomass concentrations stay strictly positive, with solution trajectories confined to a biologically feasible invariant set. Additionally, we analyze non-trivial equilibria under constant dilution rates and derive their stability properties. The results validate the mathematical robustness of the fractional-order chemostat model for periodic bioprocesses, offering a foundation for advanced water treatment technologies and sanitation improvements.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry of Spencer-Hodge Decompositions in Constrained Geometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the interaction mechanism between metric structures and mirror transformations in Spencer complexes of compatible pairs. Our core contribution is the establishment of mirror symmetry for Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, solving the key technical problem of analyzing the behavior of metric geometry under sign transformations. Through precise operator difference analysis, we prove that the perturbation $\mathcal{R}^k = -2(-1)^k \omega \otimes \delta^{\lambda}_{\mathfrak{g}}(s)$ induced by the mirror transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$ is a bounded compact operator, and apply Fredholm theory to establish the mirror invariance of harmonic space dimensions $\dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,\lambda} = \dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,-\lambda}$. We further prove the complete invariance of constraint strength metrics and curvature geometric metrics under mirror transformations, thus ensuring the spectral structure stability of Spencer-Hodge Laplacians. From a physical geometric perspective, our results reveal that sign transformations of constraint forces do not affect the essential topological structure of constraint systems, embodying deep symmetry principles in constraint geometry. This work connects Spencer metric theory with mirror symmetry theory, laying the foundation for further development of constraint geometric analysis and computational methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Notes on tangent bicharacteristics and ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a family of second-order hyperbolic differential operators presenting spectral transition of the Hamilton map. As a consequence we prove that the Cauchy problem is not locally solvable at the origin in Gevrey classes of order greater than some fixed value. The main feature of these operators is that they may all have bicharacteristics tangent to the double manifold.</description>

      <title>On the connectedness of the singular set of holomorphic foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a codimension 1 singular holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and let $Z$ be the union of the 1-dimensional connected components of its singular set; Dominique Cerveau asked in 2013 whether $Z$ is necessarily connected. We prove that if a $k$-dimensional holomorphic foliation on a projective manifold whose determinant bundle of the normal sheaf is ample has a singular set $Z$ of dimension $k-1$, then $Z$ is connected. This can be regarded as providing an obstruction for the integrability of singular holomorphic distributions in the spirit of Bott's work.</description>
