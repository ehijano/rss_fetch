      <title>Beam Intensity Limitations in Future Multi-Bend Achromat Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that emittance of fourth-generation 6 GeV machines such as PETRA IV is close to what is theoretically achievable due to beam intensity limitations from space charge and intra-beam scattering. Investigating these limitations, in particular their scaling with the bare lattice emittance and the beam energy, we argue that achieving further significant emittance reduction and increase in radiation brightness is only possible by increasing the beam energy. We outline the design and technological challenges on the way to such improvement.</description>

      <title>Development of an achromatic spectrometer for a laser-wakefield-accelerator experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large gradients of plasma-wakefield accelerators promise to shorten accelerators and reduce their financial and environmental costs. For such accelerators, a key challenge is the transport of beams with high divergence and energy spread. Achromatic optics is a potential solution that would allow staging of plasma accelerators without beam-quality degradation. For this, a nonlinear plasma lens is being developed within the SPARTA project. As a first application of this lens, we aim to implement an achromatic spectrometer for electron bunches produced by a laser-wakefield accelerator. This will greatly improve the resolution across the typically one to tens of percent energy spread bunches and therefore help diagnosis and optimization of the plasma interaction. We report on progress in designing such an experiment.</description>

      <title>High brightness, symmetric electron bunch generation in a plasma wakefield accelerator via a radially-polarized plasma photocathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma photocathode has previously been proposed as a source of ultra-high-brightness electron bunches within plasma accelerators. Here, the scheme is extended by using a radially-polarized ionizing laser pulse to generate high-charge, high-brightness electron bunches with symmetric transverse emittance. Efficient start-to-end modelling of the scheme, from ionization and trapping until drive bunch depletion, enables a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation routine to be performed to understand the performance of the radially-polarized plasma photocathode, quantify the stability of the scheme, and explore the fundamental relation between the witness bunch charge and its emittance. Comparison of plasma photocathodes driven by radially- and linearly-polarized laser pulses show that the former yields higher brightness electron bunches when operating in the optimally-loaded regime.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Characteristic transition of the dominant power loss from diffractive to ohmic in overmoded and periodically loaded waveguides at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of electromagnetic fields in cylindrical waveguiding structures that contain periodic ring loading, whether for applications in charged-particle accelerators or radiation transportation, has been traditionally conducted under simplifying limits, where the structure is either single-moded at the lower-frequency limit or overmoded at high-frequency limit. These limits have often allowed us to find spectral (modal) expansions for the fields under simpler analytical and computational conditions, with ohmic effects typically being the dominant power loss mechanism in the lower limit, while diffraction effects dominate the loss in the higher limit. In this Letter, we report the observation of a transition point in the character of the main loss mechanism, where ohmic loss becomes dominant in a structure typically presumed to be dominated by diffraction loss. The results follow a formal analysis for the scattered vector fields in a highly overmoded THz waveguide. The findings bridge between the traditional theoretical descriptions for the two limits and reveal key tradeoffs that inform experiments for the transportation of THz radiation over long distances.</description>

      <title>Novel Direct Alpha Spectroscopy Technique for $^{225}$Ac Radiopharmaceutical detection in Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT) employs alpha-emitting radionuclides conjugated to tumor-targeting molecules to deliver localized radiation to cancer cells, showing great promise in treating metastatic cancers. Among these radionuclides, Actinium-225 ($^{225}$Ac, t$_{1/2}$ = 9.9 days) has emerged as a clinically promising candidate. Its decay chain generates four successive alpha emissions, resulting in highly localized and effective cytotoxic damage to cancer cells when delivered to tumor sites. However, the assumption of complete retention of $^{225}$Ac and its radioactive daughters at these target sites is often inaccurate. The nuclear recoil effect can lead to off-target distribution and unintended toxicity.
  Our results revealed distinct spectral differences between radiolabeled cells and reference samples, demonstrating [$^{225}$Ac]Ac-crown-TATE uptake by AR42J cells. Detection of $^{213}$Po, one of the $^{225}$Ac decay daughters, highlighted partial retention and release of decay products from cells, providing information on intracellular retention and daughter redistribution. Geant4 simulations confirmed the alignment of experimental data with theoretical models, validating the method's accuracy. This study establishes a direct alpha spectroscopy approach for investigating $^{225}$Ac and its daughters' behavior in cells and offers a powerful tool for microdosimetry estimation.</description>
