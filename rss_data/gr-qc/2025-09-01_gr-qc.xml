      <title>The Influence of Uniform Magnetic Fields on Strong Field Gravitational Lensing by Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.</description>

      <title>Power-Law and Logarithmic Entropy-Corrected Ricci Dark Energy in a Non-Flat FRW Universe with Viscous Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the logarithmic-corrected and the power-law corrected versions of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in the non-flat FRW universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infra-red cut-off with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter $\omega_{\Lambda} '$
  in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE) models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills (YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.</description>

      <title>PRECESSION 2.1: black-hole binary spin precession on eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present version 2.1 of the public code {\sc precession}, a Python module for studying the post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black hole binaries. In this release, we extend the code to handle eccentric orbits. This extension leverages the existing numerical infrastructure wherever possible, introducing a semi-automatic method to adapt circular-orbit functions to the eccentric case via a Python decorator. Additional new features include orbit- and precession-averaged evolutionary equations for the eccentricity, as well as revised expressions to convert between post-Newtonian separation and gravitational-wave emission frequency.</description>

      <title>Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Loopy Black-Hole Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantized area predicted by loop quantum gravity suggests the existence of a lower bound for black-hole horizons. We prove this intuition within a covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity, where nonsingular quasi-static black holes evaporate until their horizons attain the smallest positive eigenvalue of the area operator. Consistent with the third law of black-hole thermodynamics, this final state -- characterized by vanishing temperature and entropy -- cannot be realized in finite time. The process thus leads to the formation of stable remnants, whose estimated masses are approximately 20.94$\mu$g, lying in the Planck regime.</description>

      <title>Persistence of post-Newtonian structure in binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of quasi-circular, nonprecessing binary black hole mergers using 283 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs. We construct fits using the leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$ from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger ($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger. Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$ mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.</description>

      <title>Classification of global structures of evaporating regular black holes with infinite periods of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out model independent analyses for global structures of spherically symmetric regular black holes that evaporate and approach the extremal state spending infinite periods of time due to Hawking radiation.
  We assume the radius of the outer apparent horizon (outer AH) to be a decreasing function of ingoing null coordinate, and consider the three cases, Cases 1, 2, and 3, where the radius of the inner AH is a constant, increases, and decreases, respectively.
  A complete classification of the Penrose diagrams is presented in each case, taking account not only of the presence and absence of the event horizon but also of the relative positions of the inner and outer AHs.
  Sufficient conditions that lead to each type are proved, and the examples of each type are summarized.
  We also study the behavior of outgoing null geodesics in models where the null geodesic equation is solvable, and figure out the important factors to determine the type of a spacetime using concepts in the area of dynamical systems.
  The formation of a Cauchy horizon is also established in the solvable models when the event horizon is present.</description>

      <title>The impact of plunging matter on black-hole waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes, frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Braneworlds in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the features of a thick braneworld model in five dimensions governed by a Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a non-minimal coupling to a dynamical scalar field. We consider two possible scalar-GB coupling function $\chi(\phi)$, one parity-even and another parity-odd function of the scalar field $\phi$. For both choices, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet non-minimal coupling produces a warped asymptotically $AdS_5$ spacetime even in the absence of a bulk cosmological constant. Outside the brane core, a negative cosmological constant is bounded by the scalar-GB coupling function. For a thick 3-brane configuration, we found solutions with localized brane energy density and pressure that dynamically produce a bulk cosmological constant. The corresponding scalar field solutions exhibit a non-topological (domain wall) behavior. In order to probe the 3-brane stability solution, we employed a perturbative analysis, by perturbing the thick brane solutions up to first-order. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensorial gravitational modes possess a localized massless mode and a tower of non-tachyonic diverging massive modes, what renders the solutions stable at least at the perturbative level.</description>

      <title>The effect of the gravitational constant variation on the phase of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously investigated the effect of the gravitational constant variation on the gravitational wave propagation. Pure theoretical analysis indicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation corrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect corrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique is used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than the amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain the gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to wait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the signal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current detection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint $|\frac{G'}{G}|&lt;10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without electromagnetic counterparts. For gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts which provide the information of source's luminosity distance, the phase correction can almost always be neglected to constrain $\frac{G'}{G}$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.</description>

      <title>Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the model\'s ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.</description>

      <title>The degeneracy between microlensing wave effect and precession in strongly lensed gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microlensing induced by the stellar field within a strong lensing galaxy can introduce fluctuations in the waveforms of strongly-lensed gravitational waves.When fitting these signals with templates that do not account for microlensing,possible degeneracies can lead to false evidence of certain intrinsic parameters,resulting in a misinterpretation of the properties of the underlying system.For example,the wave effect of microlensing may mimic spin precessions,as both effects generically induce periodic waveform modulations.Although previous studies suggest that lensing-induced modulations can be distinguished from precession using parameter estimation under a geometric-optic approximation,it does not directly apply for lensed image through stellar fields due to large number of stars involved an wave-optic effects.This study aims to evaluate the degree of degeneracy between the stellar-field microlensing and spin precession,investigating whether microlensing leads false evidence of precession.In other words,to what extent observed SLGWs are identified with false evidence of precession.The main findings are as follows.First,assuming O5 sensitivity and parallel spins for the underlying binary black holes,microlensing-induced false evidence of precession is generally weak(15% of the events show significant evidence,30% if the signal-to-noise ratio doubles).Second,for highly magnified events,about 72% of the population show significant evidence of precession,which could serve as an identification criterion for microlensing.This implies the possibility of strong lensing for the recent event GW231123,which is in the mass gap and also shows evidence of precession.Finally,a moderate to strong positive correlation exists between microlensing strength and precession evidence,more pronounced in Type II SLGWs.This suggests that stronger precession evidence may imply a stronger microlensing effect.</description>

      <title>Atom Interferometer Phase Shear and Spacetime Sectional Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general relativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer phase and geometric properties of spacetime. Here we show that a different atom interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses. This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive extended Kalman filter and laser link acquisition in the detection of gravitational waves in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative, new laser link acquisition scheme for the triangular constellation of spacecraft (SCs) in deep space in the detection of gravitational waves is considered. In place of a wide field CCD camera in the initial stage of laser link acquisition adopted in the conventional scheme, an extended Kalman filter based on precision orbit determination is incorporated in the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) to steer the laser beam in such a way to narrow the uncertainty cone and at the same time avoids the heating problem generated by the CCD camera.A quadrant photodetector (QPD) based on the Differential Power Sensing (DPS) technique, which offers a higher dynamic range than differential wavefront sensing (DWS), is employed as the readout of the laser beam spot. The conventional two stages (coarse acquisition and fine acquisition) are integrated into a single control loop. The payload structure of the ATP control loop is simplified and numerical simulations, based on a colored measurement noise model that closely mimics the prospective on-orbit conditions, demonstrate that the AEKF significantly reduces the initial uncertainty region by predicting the point ahead angle (PAA) even when the worst case scenario in SC position (navigation) error is considered.</description>

      <title>Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Self energy in Kerr-Sen space-time incorporated to overspinning and overcharging problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous attempts to overspin or overcharge Kerr-Sen black holes have been incomplete, as they neglect back-reaction effects. In this study, we incorporate the self-energy of perturbations, resulting from the induced increase in the angular velocity and the electrostatic potential of the event horizon, as described in a seminal work by Will. Our analysis demonstrates that Kerr-Sen black holes cannot be overspun or overcharged by perturbations that satisfy the null energy condition, within a comprehensive second-order framework that includes the self-energy of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory spacelike singularities: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ vacuum models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graph representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

      <title>The Science of the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is the European project for a gravitational-wave (GW) observatory of third-generation. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of an external, weak, asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain the general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term, depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electric charge, as well as the properties of the test particle, such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of the external and internal parameters of the spacetime.</description>

Abstract: In this work, based on the $3+1$ decomposition in [24, 33], we present a fully exterior calculus breakdown of spacetime and Einstein's equations. Links to the orthonormal frame approach [38] are drawn to help understand the variables in this context. Two formulations are derived, discretised and tested using the exterior calculus discrete de Rham complex [13], and some discrete quantities are shown to be conserved in one of the cases.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating and Tidal Deformation of Nonlocal Modified Tolman VII Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the moment of inertia, quadrupole deformation, and tidal deformation within the framework of nonlocal gravity, utilizing the exact modified Tolman-VII (NEMTVII) density model with an isotropic perfect fluid. The Love number~$(k_{2})$ is derived using standard even-parity perturbation theory. Additionally, we explore the observational implications by analyzing the tidal deformability parameter~$( \lambda_{\textrm{tid}} )$ in comparison with the constraints from GW170817, GW190425, PSR J0348+0432, and PSR J0740+6620. We found that the results are consistent with the tidal constraint when $\alpha \gtrsim 1.6$ with the small $\beta$. For slowly rotating object, the dimensionless moment of inertia~$( \bar{I} )$, rotational Love parameter~$( \bar{\lambda}_{\textrm{rot}} )$, and quadrupole moment~$( \bar{Q} )$ are fully determined by the perturbed metric. Our findings reveal that the nonlocal parameter~$( \beta )$ significantly affects the star radius. For a fixed $\beta$ and varying $\alpha$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations are found to be universal. For varying $\beta$, the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations become non-universal.</description>

      <title>Einstein@Home all-sky "bucket" search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO O3 public data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves using LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We search for nearly-monochromatic signals with frequencies $30\, \text{Hz} \leq f \leq 250\, \text{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s} \leq \dot{f} \leq 0.2 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s}$. We deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project and on three super computer clusters; the Atlas supercomputer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and the two high performance computing systems Raven and Viper at the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$, and translate these to upper limits on the neutron star ellipticity and on the r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at 173 Hz with $h_{0} = 6.5\times 10^{-26}$, at the 90% confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for nearly-monochromatic gravitational wave signals with frequencies $800.0~\textrm{Hz} \leq f \leq 1686.0~\textrm{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7\times10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1} \leq \dot f \leq 0.2\times 10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. We use LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors and deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project. This is the most sensitive search carried out to date in this parameter space. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$ and translate these to upper limits on neutron star ellipticity and on r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at $800~\textrm{Hz}$ with $h_{0} = 1.32\times10^{-25}$, at the $90\%$ confidence level. Searching in the high frequency bands allows us to probe astrophysically interesting ellipticities with our results excluding isolated neutron stars rotating faster than $2.5~\textrm{ms}$ with ellipticities $\epsilon \geq 1.96 \times 10^{-8}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ within a distance $d$ from Earth. Our results also exclude r-mode amplitudes $\alpha \geq 7 \times 10^{-7}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ for neutron stars stars spinning faster than 400 Hz.</description>

      <title>Can a pure state remain pure in the Unruh effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A uniformly accelerated detector in an inertial vacuum undergoes an unavoidable dissipation, and the final steady-state becomes thermal. However, to attain such a mixed state, there is no bound for the acceleration of the single atomic detector. Here we show that the scenario is entirely different for two atoms with the same energy levels. There exists a critical limit of the acceleration for two atomic detectors, below which the purity of a particular initial state can be preserved. We observe that the generator of the dissipative dynamics (Lindbladian) is invariant under a weak symmetry transformation at this limit. Hence one of the eigenstates of the symmetry operator is unchanged during the evolution. This kind of state is called a quantum dark state, which is essentially a decoherence-free subspace. As a consequence, the system becomes localized, and it can skip the Unruh thermalization. Beyond the critical limit, the symmetry is explicitly broken. Therefore our results suggest that the system goes through a first-order dissipative phase transition from a localized to a thermal phase.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Mounds: towards a realistic description of dark matter overdensities around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can be searched for by looking at the characteristic imprint they leave on the gravitational waveform of binary black hole mergers. Current theoretical predictions of the density profile of dark matter overdensities are based on highly idealised formation scenarios, in which black holes are assumed to grow adiabatically from an infinitesimal seed to their final mass, compressing dark matter cusps at the center of galactic halos into very dense `spikes'. These scenarios were suitable for dark matter indirect detection studies, since annihilating dark matter cannot reach very high densities, but they fail to capture the dark matter distribution in the innermost regions where the gravitational wave signal is produced. We present here a more realistic formation scenario where black holes form from the collapse of supermassive stars, and follow the evolution of the dark matter density as the supermassive star grows and collapses to a black hole. We show that in this case dark matter forms shallower `mounds', instead of `spikes', on scales comparable with the size of the supermassive stars originating them. We discuss the implications for the detectability of these systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel holographic dictionary for the thermodynamics of black holes with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating asymptotics, generalizing the dictionary for Anti-de Sitter black holes. Using our dictionary we show that the holographic Euler equation is dual to a generalized Smarr formula for these black holes, and we find a precise match between the extended bulk and boundary first law. Notably, the dictionary for the central charge appearing in the Euler relation depends on the hyperscaling violating parameter, but not on the Lifshitz dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the Pulsar Timing Array likelihood: A path towards Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11894v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent announcement of evidence for a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWB) in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has piqued interest across the scientific community. A combined analysis of all currently available data holds the promise of confirming the announced evidence as a solid detection of a GWB. However, the complexity of individual pulsar noise models and the variety of modeling tools used for different types of pulsars present significant challenges for a truly unified analysis. In this work we propose a novel approach to the analysis of PTA data: first a posterior distribution over Fourier modes is produced for each pulsar individually. Then, in a global analysis of all pulsars these posterior distributions can be re-used for a GWB search, which retains all information regarding the signals of interest without the added complexity of the underlying noise models or implementation differences. This approach facilitates combining radio and gamma-ray pulsar data, while reducing the complexity of the model and of its implementations when carrying out a GWB search with PTA data.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unify the dynamics of massive vector (Proca) fields in Schwarzschild spacetime with supersymmetric gauge theories through the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal mode (SW/QNM) duality. By mapping Proca perturbations-specifically monopole and odd-parity modes governed by confluent Heun equations-to the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve, we establish a gauge-gravity correspondence. Leveraging instanton counting, we analytically compute QNM and quasi-bound state frequencies to high precision, resolving spectral properties non-perturbatively. Our results align with numerical benchmarks while extending the SW framework beyond scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the solution phase space method, we investigate the conserved charges of BTZ-like black holes in Einstein-bumblebee gravity. Our study shows that the black hole mass, angular momentum and entropy are influenced by the Lorentz-violating parameter. Through the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we derive the asymptotic charge algebra, which consists of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with non-trivial central charges. By employing the Cardy formula, we calculate the microscopic entropy of dual conformal field theory, which precisely matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, by imposing the Detournay-Smoes-Wutte boundary conditions in the near horizon geometry of the extremal BTZ-like black hole, we obtain a Virasoro-Kac-Moody $\mathrm{U(1)}$ algebra, representing the symmetry algebra of a warped conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi-natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic temperature-dependent dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension-five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Gravity versus astrophysics in black hole images and photon rings: Equatorial emissions and spherically symmetric space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EHT collaboration released in 2019 the first horizon-scale images of a black hole accretion flow, opening a novel route for plasma physics comprehension and gravitational tests. Although the present unresolved images deeply depend on the astrophysical properties of the accreted matter, GR predicts that they contain highly lensed observables, the "photon rings", embodying the effects of strong-field gravity. Focusing on the supermassive black hole M87* and adopting a geometrically thin, equatorial disc as a phenomenological configuration for the accreting matter, our goal is to study the degeneracy of spacetime curvature and of physically-motivated emission processes on EHT-like images observed at 230 and 345 GHz. In a parametric framework, we simulate adaptively ray-traced images using GYOTO in various spherically-symmetric spacetime geometries, for a comprehensive class of disc velocities and realistic synchrotron emission profiles. We then extract the width and the peak position of 1D intensity cross sections on the direct image and the first photon ring. We show that, among the investigated quantities, the most appropriate observables to probe the geometry are the peak positions of the first photon ring. Small geometric deviations can be unequivocally detected, regardless of the motion of the disc, ranging from a Keplerian to a radially infalling one, if the black hole mass-to-distance estimate is accurate up to around 2%; the current uncertainty of 11% being sufficient just to access extreme deviations. The equatorial set-up of this paper, favoured by present EHT observations of M87*, is adapted to model future measurements at higher observing frequencies, where absorption effects are negligible, and with higher resolution, indispensable to resolve the photon rings. Additional work is needed to investigate if our conclusions hold for more realistic disc configurations.</description>

Abstract: Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>

Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>
