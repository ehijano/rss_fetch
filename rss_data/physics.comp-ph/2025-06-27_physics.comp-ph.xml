      <title>On the rank-reduced relativistic coupled cluster method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficiency of the Tucker decomposition of amplitude tensors within the single-reference relativistic coupled cluster method with single and double excitations (RCCSD) was studied in a series of benchmark calculations for (AuCl)$_n$ chains, Au$_n$ clusters, and the cluster model of solid YbCl$_2$. The 1 kJ/mol level of accuracy for correlation energy estimates of moderate-size systems and typical reaction energies can be achieved with relatively high compression rates of amplitude tensors via rejecting singular values smaller than $\sim 10^{-4}$. For the most extensive system studied (YbCl$_7$ cluster used for modeling of ytterbium center in ytterbium dichloride crystal), only $\sim 3$% of compressed doubles amplitudes were shown to be significant. Thus, the rank reduction for the relativistic CCSD theory improving its computational scaling is feasible. The advantage (if not necessity) of using the Goldstone diagrammatic technique rather than the "antisymmetrized" Brandow one is underlined. The proposed approach is promising for high-precision modeling of relatively large systems with heavy atoms.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic phonons via quantum thermal bath simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations within crystalline solids, or phonons, provide information on a variety of important material characteristics, from thermal qualities to optical properties and phase transition behaviour. When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Parallelization of Electrostatic Particle-In-Cell for low-temperature Plasma Simulation by particle-thread Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation tracks particle phase space information using particle and grid data structures. High computational costs in 2D and 3D device-scale PIC simulations necessitate parallelization, with the Charge Deposition (CD) subroutine often becoming a bottleneck due to frequent particle-grid interactions. Conventional methods mitigate dependencies by generating private grids for each core, but this approach faces scalability issues. We propose a novel approach based on a particle-thread binding strategy that requires only four private grids per node in distributed memory systems or four private grids in shared memory systems, enhancing CD scalability and performance while maintaining conventional data structures and requiring minimal changes to existing PIC codes. This method ensures complete accessibility of grid data structure for concurrent threads and avoids simultaneous access to particles within the same cell using additional functions and flags. Performance evaluations using a PIC benchmark for low-temperature partially magnetized E x B discharge simulation on a shared memory as well as a distributed memory system (1000 cores) demonstrate the method's scalability, and additionally, we show the method has little hardware dependency.</description>

      <title>Stochastic and Non-local Closure Modeling for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems via Latent Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.</description>

      <title>Boundary integral equation analysis for spheroidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a fast, spectrally accurate method for the evaluation of boundary integral operators (BIOs) on a suspension of prolate and oblate spheroids. We first derive formulas for the standard layer potential operators for the Laplace equation applied to an expansion of the integral densities in the appropriate spheroidal harmonic basis. These then lead to analytical expressions in solid harmonics that allow spectrally accurate evaluation of near-field particle interactions. Finally, a standard quadrature scheme is used to evaluate smooth, far-field interactions; these are then accelerated using the fast multipole method.
  Through a number of numerical test cases, we verify the accuracy and efficiency of our BIO evaluation framework for dense, polydisperse suspensions of spheroids. Through the use of standard formulas linking Stokes and Laplace potentials, we show our scheme can be readily applied to problems involving particulate suspension flows. For both Laplace and Stokes, our method allows us to evaluate BIOs for suspensions up to hundreds of particles on a single processor.</description>

      <title>Multicontinuum Homogenization for Poroelasticity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive multicontinuum poroelasticity models using the multicontinuum homogenization method. Poroelasticity models are widely used in many areas of science and engineering to describe coupled flow and mechanics processes in porous media. However, in many applications, the properties of poroelastic media possess high contrast, presenting serious computational challenges. It is well known that standard homogenization approaches often fail to give an accurate solution due to the lack of macroscopic parameters. Multicontinuum approaches allow us to consider such cases by defining several average states known as continua. In the field of poroelasticity, multiple-network models arising from the multiple porous media theory are representatives of these approaches. In this work, we extend previous findings by deriving the generalized multicontinuum poroelasticity model. We apply the recently developed multicontinuum homogenization method and provide a rigorous derivation of multicontinuum equations. For this purpose, we formulate coupled constraint cell problems in oversampled regions to consider different homogenized effects. Then, we obtain a multicontinuum expansion of the fine-scale fields and derive the multicontinuum model supposing the smoothness of macroscopic variables. We present the most general version of equations and the simplified ones based on our numerical experiments. Numerical results are presented for different heterogeneous media cases and demonstrate the high accuracy of our proposed multicontinuum models.</description>

      <title>On the coordinate system-dependence of the accuracy of symplectic numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic numerical methods have become a widely-used choice for the accurate simulation of Hamiltonian systems in various fields, including celestial mechanics, molecular dynamics and robotics. Even though their characteristics are well-understood mathematically, relatively little attention has been paid in general to the practical aspect of how the choice of coordinates affects the accuracy of the numerical results, even though the consequences can be computationally significant. The present article aims to fill this gap by giving a systematic overview of how coordinate transformations can influence the results of simulations performed using symplectic methods. We give a derivation for the non-invariance of the modified Hamiltonian of symplectic methods under coordinate transformations, as well as a sufficient condition for the non-preservation of a first integral corresponding to a cyclic coordinate for the symplectic Euler method. We also consider the possibility of finding order-compensating coordinate transformations that improve the order of accuracy of a numerical method. Various numerical examples are presented throughout.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>

      <title>Correlated reaction coordinate motion produces non-additive rate enhancement for electron and energy transfer in multi-acceptor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the uniform accuracy of implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes for general linear hyperbolic relaxation systems satisfying the structural stability condition proposed in \cite{yong_singular_1999}. We establish the uniform stability and accuracy of a class of IMEX-RK schemes with spatial discretization using a Fourier spectral method. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of the fully discretized schemes is independent of the relaxation time across all regimes. Numerical experiments on applications in traffic flows and kinetic theory verify our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials leveraging microstructure representation from foundational vision transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the production of high-resolution images of typical support elements in concrete structures by means of muon tomography (muography). By exploiting detailed Monte Carlo radiation-matter simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing 1 cm-thick iron bars inside 30 cm-deep concrete blocks, regarded as an important testbed within the structural diagnostics community. In addition, we present a new method for integrating simulated data with advanced deep learning techniques in order to improve the muon imaging of concrete structures. Through deep learning enhancement techniques, this results in a dramatic improvement in image quality and a significant reduction in data acquisition time, which are two critical limitations within the usual practice of muography for civil engineering diagnostics.</description>

      <title>TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented, computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning and quantum computing tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF database. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. The data supports computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations that are needed for inverse material design. For validation and reuse, we have made the data available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/tbhubbard/.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Distance-Enabled Active Learning for Efficient Data-Driven Model Reduction of Parametric Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties. However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22% reduction in mean absolute error over the state-of-the-art baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The implementation and accompanying dataset are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/xChemAgents.</description>
