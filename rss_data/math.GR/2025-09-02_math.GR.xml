      <title>On the connectedness of the boundary of hierarchically hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, under a mild assumption, any metrizable compactification of a one-ended proper geodesic metric space is connected. As a consequence, we deduce that the boundary, introduced by Durham--Hagen--Sisto, of a one-ended hierarchically hyperbolic space is connected. Moreover, we prove that the connectedness of the boundary of a hierarchically hyperbolic group is equivalent to the one-endedness of the group. As an application, we show that if, for $n\geq 2$, $G_1=A_1\ast\dots\ast A_n$ and $G_2=B_1\ast\dots\ast B_n$ are free products of one-ended hierarchically hyperbolic groups, then the boundary of $G_1$ is homeomorphic to the boundary of $G_2$ if and only if the boundary of $A_i$ is homeomorphic to the boundary of $B_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$.</description>

      <title>The $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this summary paper, we present the key ideas behind the recent proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups, which states that complements of locally finite affine hyperplane arrangements with real equations and stable under orthogonal reflections are aspherical. We survey three facets of the argument: the combinatorics of noncrossing partition posets associated with Coxeter groups; the appearance of dual Artin groups and the question of their isomorphism with standard Artin groups; the topological models and their interplay in the proof.</description>

      <title>Factorization in Finitely-Presented Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study arithmetic properties of factorizations of elements into products of generators, in monoids given with explicit presentations. After relating and comparing this perspective to the more usual approach of factoring into products of atoms, we explore how the relations in the presentation of a monoid affect factorization. In the process, we construct a large class of non-commutative fully elastic monoids. We also show that any finitely-presented cancellative normalizing monoid satisfies the Structure Theorem for Unions. Examples are constructed to demonstrate the sharpness of our results, and exhibit unusual factorization behavior.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy invariants for powers of rigid braids: a uniformity phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $m$-strand braid $x$ which is rigid in the sense of Garside-theory. Let $SC(x)$ be the set of rigid conjugates of $x$ -- this is a well-known characteristic subset of the conjugacy class of $x$. We present computational evidence that the sequence $(|SC(x^n)|)\_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is not only bounded, but in fact periodic, and that the length of the period can be bounded in terms of the number of strands $m$. We prove this result in the special case of the 3-strand braid group (where we prove that the sequence is always constant) and of the dual $4$-strand braid group.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties of unit groups of von Neumann's continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, if $R$ is an irreducible, continuous ring, then its unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$, equipped with the topology generated by the rank metric, is topologically simple modulo its center, path-connected, locally path-connected, bounded in the sense of Bourbaki, and not admitting any non-zero escape function. All these topological insights are consequences of more refined geometric results concerning the rank metric, in particular with regard to the set of algebraic elements. Thanks to the phenomenon of automatic continuity, our results also have non-trivial ramifications for the underlying abstract groups.</description>

      <title>An elementary classification of the quaternionic reflection groups of rank two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary classification and presentation of the finite quaternionic reflection groups of rank two, based on the notion of a``reflection system''. This simplifies the existing classification, which is shown to be incomplete, e.g., there exist four imprimitive quaternionic reflection groups of order 192 with 22 reflections which are not isomorphic (one of which was previously unknown).</description>

      <title>Twisted Conjugacy Growth of the Generalised Heisenberg Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the twisted conjugacy growth function for automorphisms on generalised Heisenberg groups. In particular we demonstrate for these groups that up to a natural equivalence this function is either given by $n^k$ or $n^k\ln(n)$ for some constant $k$. We give a precise description for which of these functions we obtain in terms of dimensions and ranks on the upper and lower central series. In particular we obtain that the twisted conjugacy growth is always bounded by the conjugacy growth.</description>

      <title>Embedability of right-angled Artin groups into hierarchically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a hierarchically hyperbolic group, we provide sufficient conditions under which suitable powers of a finite collection of elements generate a right-angled Artin subgroup. Under additional hypotheses, we further show that this subgroup can be promoted to be quasi-isometrically embedded. Our framework recovers and unifies earlier results, including those of Clay-Leininger-Mangahas \cite{CLM12} and Runnels \cite{Run21} for mapping class groups, and of Kim-Koberda \cite{KK13} for right-angled Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the polynomials over the spherical subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite subgroup $W \subset \GL(\fh)$ of the linear group of a finite-dimensional complex vector field $\fh$, it is a well-studied problem to describe the structure of the symmetric algebra $B= \sym(\fh^*)$ as a representation of $G$, and also as a module over the ring of invariant differential operators under $W$ in the ring $\D(\fh)$ of differential operators on $\fh$. Since the rational Cherednik algebra $H_c(W,\fh)$ and the spherical algebra $eH_ce$ are respectively universal deformations of the ring $\D(\fh)$ and the ring $\D(\fh)^W$of $W$-invariant differential operators, we would like to build an analogy between the decomposition of modules over the invariant differential operators in \cite{ Nonk1, Nonk2, Nonk3} and the decomposition of modules over the sperical subalgebra of the rational Cherednik algebra. The ring $\D_c= eH_ce$ inherits the natural grading of $B$, and we let $\D_c^0 \subset \D_c$ and $\D_c^{-} \subset \D_c$ be subset of elements of degree 0 end strictly negative degree, respectively. Our main result is that there is for all finite reflection groups a lowest weight description of the category of $\D_c$-modules of $B$ where the ring $\Rc_c= \D_c^0 / \Dc_c^0 \cap \D_c \D_c^{-}$ plays the very important role of Cartan algebra.</description>

      <title>Extended Weak Order for the Rank 3 Universal Coxeter Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak order is a classical poset structure on a Coxeter group; it is a lattice when the group is finite but merely a meet-semilattice when the group is infinite. Motivated by problems in Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, Matthew Dyer introduced the extended weak order, a poset that contains a copy of the weak order as an order ideal, and he conjectured that the extended weak order for any Coxeter group is a lattice. We prove Dyer's conjecture for the rank 3 universal Coxeter group. This is the first non-spherical, non-affine Coxeter group for which Dyer's conjecture has been proven.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working towards an alternative deduction of the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring, which we deduce is injective and an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction.
  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising (up to a shift) from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial complex is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivial complexes are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</description>

      <title>Profinite approach to S-adic shift spaces I: Saturating directive sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of three, about (relatively)
  free profinite semigroups and S-adic representations of minimal
  shift spaces. We associate to each primitive S-adic directive
  sequence ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ a $\textit{profinite image}$ in the free profinite
  semigroup over the alphabet of the induced minimal shift space. When
  this profinite image contains a $\mathcal{J}$-maximal maximal subgroup
  of the free profinite semigroup (which, up to isomorphism, is called
  the $\textit{Sch\"utzenberger group}$ of the shift space), we say that
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is $\textit{saturating}$. We show that if ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is
  recognizable, then it is saturating. Conversely, we use the notion
  of saturating sequence to obtain several sufficient conditions for
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ to be recognizable: ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ consists of pure encodings;
  or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, saturating and consists of
  encodings; or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, recurrent,
  bounded and consists of encodings. For the most part, we do not
  assume that ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ has finite alphabet rank although we establish
  that this combinatorial property has important algebraic
  consequences, namely that the rank of the Sch\"utzenberger group is
  also finite, whose maximum possible value we also determine.
  We also show that for every minimal shift space of finite topological rank, the rank of its Sch\"utzenberger group is a lower bound of the topological rank.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the homology groups of any connected reductive group over a field with coefficients in the Steinberg representation vanish in a range. The generalizes work of Ash-Putman-Sam on the classical split groups. We state a connectivity conjecture that would allow us to prove such a vanishing result for $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$, as was conjectured by Church-Farb-Putman. We prove some special cases of this conjecture and use it to refine known results about the first and second of homology of $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ with Steinberg coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Hom-heaps, Hom-trusses, and Hom-braces as natural Hom-type analogues of their classical counterparts. We establish the correspondence between Hom-heaps and Hom-groups, showing that the retract of a Hom-heap at a point yields a Hom-group precisely when the point is fixed under the twisting map. Three interrelated definitions of Hom-trusses are introduced and their structural properties are investigated, including the construction of modules over Hom-trusses. For Hom-braces, we propose three variants and demonstrate their close connections with Hom-trusses, proving in particular that certain Hom-trusses naturally give rise to Hom-braces and vice versa. Our results provide a systematic framework that extends heap and truss theory into the Hom-algebraic setting, opening new perspectives for applications in Yang--Baxter theory, non-associative geometry, and categorical algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the primitive quaternionic reflection groups of type P for H^2 that are obtained from Blichfeldt's collineation groups for C^4.These are seen to be intimately related to the maximal set of five quaternionic mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in H2 , for which they are symmetries. From these groups, we construct other interesting sets of lines that they fix, including a new quaternionic spherical 3-design of 16 lines in H^2 with angles {1/5,3/5}, which meets the special bound. Some interesting consequences of this investigation include finding imprimitive quaternionic reflection groups with several systems of imprimitivity, and finding a nontrivial reducible subgroup which has a continuous family of eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>A substitution lemma for multiple context-free languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new criterion for proving that a language is not multiple context-free, which we call a Substitution Lemma. We apply it to show a sample selection of languages are not multiple context-free, including the word problem of $F_2\times F_2$.
  Our result is in contrast to Kanazawa et al. [2014, Theory Comput. Syst.] who proved that it was not possible to generalise the standard pumping lemma for context-free languages to multiple context-free languages, and Kanazawa [2019, Inform. and Comput.] who showed a weak variant of generalised Ogden's lemma does not apply to multiple context-free languages.
  We also show that groups with multiple context-free word problem have rational subset membership and intersection problems.</description>

      <title>The Subalgebras of the Real Forms of \(\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})\)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the subalgebras of the real forms the complex linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$, namely the real special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$, the special unitary algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$, and the generalized special unitary algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$. Our approach applies Galois cohomology to the known classification of complex subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. The subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$ were previously classified by Winternitz using different techniques. We recover this classification using our cohomological approach and amend minor inaccuracies. Our work, however, constitutes the first complete classifications of the subalgebras of $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$. In addition to illuminating the internal structure of the real forms of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$, our methodology provides a pathway for future investigations into the subalgebra structure of higher-dimensional cases. In addition, the present work and its extensions offer potential applications in representation theory, applied mathematics, and physics.</description>

Abstract: We classify the real subalgebras of the generalized special unitary algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$, a non-compact real form of the complex special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. Our approach combines Galois cohomology with the existing classification of complex subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. This work completes the classification of real subalgebras of the non-compact real forms of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$, since those of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$ have already been classified.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be smooth manifolds, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--diffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which asserts that for integer regularities, a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We algebraically characterize free by cyclic groups that have coarse medians, and prove that this is equivalent to the a priori stronger properties of being colourable hierarchically hyperbolic groups and being quasi-isometric to CAT(0) cube complexes. Our algebraic characterization involves a condition on intersections between maximal virtually $F_n\times \mathbb Z$ subgroups that we call having "unbranched blocks". We also characterize hierarchical hyperbolicity of $\Gamma=F_n\rtimes_{\phi}\mathbb Z$ in terms of a property of completely split relative train track representatives of $\phi\in\mathrm{Out}(F_n)$ that we call "excessive linearity", a slight refinement of the rich linearity condition for relative train track maps introduced by Munro and Petyt.</description>

      <title>Odd Grassmannian bimodules and derived equivalences for spin symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove odd analogs of results of Chuang and Rouquier on sl(2)-categorification. Combined also with recent work of the second author with Livesey, this allows us to complete the proof of Brou\'e's Abelian Defect Conjecture for the double covers of symmetric groups. The article also develops the theory of odd symmetric functions initiated a decade ago by Ellis, Khovanov and Lauda. A key role in our approach is played by a 2-category consisting of odd Grassmannian bimodules over superalgebras which are odd analogs of equivariant cohomology algebras of Grassmannians. This is the odd analog of the category of Grassmannian bimodules which was at the heart of Lauda's independent approach to categorification of sl(2). We also construct an action of the odd Kac-Moody 2-category of sl(2) on the 2-category of odd Grassmannian bimodules, and use this to give a new proof of its non-degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Mekler's Construction and Murphy's Law for 2-Nilpotent Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on transfer of burden.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds. In other words, the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part, i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition. On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3-manifold group may not uniquely determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2011, Barot and Marsh provided an explicit construction of presentation of a finite Weyl group $W$ by any quiver mutation-equivalent to an orientation of a Dynkin diagram with Weyl group $W$. The construction was extended by the authors of the present paper to obtain presentations for all affine Coxeter groups, as well as to construct groups from triangulations of unpunctured surfaces and orbifolds, where the groups are invariant under change of triangulation and thus are presented as quotients of numerous distinct Coxeter groups. We extend the construction to include most punctured surfaces and orbifolds, providing a new invariant for almost all marked surfaces.</description>

      <title>$F$-birestriction monoids in enriched signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest to $F$-inverse monoids, on the one hand, and to restriction and birestriction monoids, on the other hand, we initiate the study of $F$-birestriction monoids as algebraic structures in the enriched signature $(\cdot, \, ^*, \,^+, \, ^{\mathfrak{m}},1)$ where the unary operation $(\cdot)^{\mathfrak{m}}$ maps each element to the maximum element of its $\sigma$-class.
  We find a presentation of the free $F$-birestriction monoid ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ as a birestriction monoid ${\mathcal F}$ over the extended set of generators $X\cup\overline{X^+}$ where $\overline{X^+}$ is a set in a bijection with the free semigroup $X^+$ and encodes the maximum elements of (non-projection) $\sigma$-classes. This enables us to show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ decomposes as the partial action product $E({\mathcal I})\rtimes X^*$ of the idempotent semilattice of the universal inverse monoid ${\mathcal I}$ of ${\mathcal F}$ partially acted upon by the free monoid $X^*$. Invoking Sch\"utzenberger graphs, we prove that the word problem for ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ and its strong and perfect analogues is decidable. Furthermore, we show that ${\mathsf{FFBR}}(X)$ does not admit a geometric model based on a quotient of the Margolis-Meakin expansion $M({\mathsf{FG}}(X), X\cup \overline{X^+})$ over the free group ${\mathsf{FG}}(X)$, but the free perfect $X$-generated $F$-birestriction monoid admits such a model.</description>

      <title>Real Rational Surface Automorphisms : Positivity and Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real dynamics of a family of rational surface automorphisms obtained from quadratic birational maps of $\pcc$ that preserve a cuspidal cubic and whose critical orbits have lengths $(1,m,n)$ with $1+m+n\ge 10$. Passing to the real locus and cutting along the invariant cubic, we obtain a diffeomorphism of an orientable surface whose fundamental group is free.
  Our key device is a finitely generated invariant, positive semigroup $S_{m,n}$ in the fundamental group on which an iterate of induced action acts by concatenation without cancellation. This positivity yields a nonnegative primitive transition matrix, so Perron-Frobenius theory supplies an explicit exponential growth rate $\lambda&gt;1$ for the induced action on the fundamental group. Consequently, the real map has positive topological entropy. We package the combinatorics of the generators in a ``Core-Tail Induction Principle," which allows us to treat simultaneously seven orbit-data families with only finite base checks. Finally, using Bestvina-Handel and the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer correspondence, we show that the induced outer automorphism with $m+n$ odd is realized by a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of the cut surface.</description>
