      <title>Bifurcations of unstable eigenvalues for Stokes waves derived from conserved energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address Euler's equations for irrotational gravity waves in an infinitely deep fluid rewritten in conformal variables. Stokes waves are traveling waves with the smooth periodic profile. In agreement with the previous numerical results, we give a rigorous proof that the zero eigenvalue bifurcation in the linearized equations of motion for co-periodic perturbations occurs at each extremal point of the energy function versus the steepness parameter, provided that the wave speed is not extremal at the same steepness. We derive the normal form for the unstable eigenvalues and, assisted with numerical approximation of its coefficients, we show that the new unstable eigenvalues emerge only in the direction of increasing steepness.</description>

      <title>Kinks of fractional $\phi^4$ models: existence, uniqueness, monotonicity, stability, and sharp asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we construct kink solutions for different (parabolic and wave) variants of the fractional $\phi^4$ model, in both the sub-Laplacian and super-Laplacian setting. We establish existence and monotonicity results (for the sub - Laplacian case), along with sharp asymptotics which are corroborated through numerical computations. Importantly, in the sub-Laplacian regime, we provide the explicit and numerically verifiable spectral condition, which guarantees uniqueness for odd kinks. We check numerically the relevant condition to confirm the uniqueness of such solutions. In addition, we show asymptotic stability for the stationary kinks in the parabolic setting and also, the spectral stability for the traveling kinks in the corresponding wave equation.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of cylindrical supersonic solutions to the steady Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrically symmetric supersonic Euler-Poisson flows in nozzles. Both three-dimensional and axisymmetric perturbations are considered. On one hand, we establish the existence and uniqueness of three-dimensional smooth supersonic solutions to the potential flow model of the steady Euler-Poisson system. On the other hand, the existence and uniqueness of smooth supersonic flows with nonzero vorticity to the steady axisymmetric Euler-Poisson system are proved. The problem is reduced to solve a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. One of the key ingredients in the analysis of three-dimensional supersonic irrotational flows is the well-posedness theory for a linear second order hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved by using the multiplier method and the reflection technique to derive the energy estimates. For smooth axisymmetric supersonic flows with nonzero vorticity, the deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition is utilized to reformulate the steady axisymmetric Euler-Poisson system as a deformation-curl-Poisson system together with several transport equations, so that one can design a two-layer iteration scheme to establish the nonlinear structural stability of the background supersonic flow within the class of axisymmetric rotational flows.</description>

      <title>Solutions with prescribed mass for $L^2$-supercritical NLS equations under Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary conditions: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u+ \lambda u= f(u) &amp; {\rm in} \,~ \Omega,\\ \displaystyle\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 \, &amp;{\rm on}\,~\partial \Omega \end{cases} \end{equation*} coupled with a constraint condition: \begin{equation*} \int_{\Omega}|u|^2 dx=c, \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N(N\ge3)$ denotes a smooth bounded domain, $\nu$ represents the unit outer normal vector to $\partial \Omega$, $c$ is a positive constant, and $\lambda$ acts as a Lagrange multiplier. When the nonlinearity $f$ exhibits a general mass supercritical growth at infinity, we establish the existence of normalized solutions, which are not necessarily positive solutions and can be characterized as mountain pass type critical points of the associated constraint functional. Our approach provides a uniform treatment of various nonlinearities, including cases such as $f(u)=|u|^{p-2}u$, $|u|^{q-2}u+ |u|^{p-2}u$, and $-|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p-2}u$, where $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt; 2^*$. The result is obtained through a combination of a minimax principle with Morse index information for constrained functionals and a novel blow-up analysis for the NLS equation under Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Standing waves with prescribed mass for NLS equations with Hardy potential in the half-space under Neumman boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the Neumann problem: \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{cases}
  &amp;-\Delta u-\frac{\mu}{|x|^2}u +\lambda u =|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{p-2}u ~~~\mbox{in}~~\mathbb{R}_+^N,~N\ge3,
  &amp;\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=0 ~~ \mbox{on}~~ \partial\mathbb{R}_+^N \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} with the prescribed mass:
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_{\mathbb{R}_+^N}|u|^2 dx=a&gt;0,
  \end{equation*} where $\mathbb{R}_+^N$ denotes the upper half-space in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $\frac{1}{|x|^2}$ is the Hardy potential, $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt;2^*$, $\mu&gt;0$, $\nu$ stands for the outward unit normal vector to $\partial \mathbb{R}_+^N$, and $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. Firstly, by applying Ekeland's variational principle, we establish the existence of normalized solutions that correspond to local minima of the associated energy functional. Furthermore, we find a second normalized solution of mountain pass type by employing a parameterized minimax principle that incorporates Morse index information. Our analysis relies on a Hardy inequality in $H^1(\mathbb{R}_+^N)$, as well as a Pohozaev identity involving the Hardy potential on $\mathbb{R}_+^N$. This work provides a variational framework for investigating the existence of normalized solutions to the Hardy type system within a half-space, and our approach is flexible, allowing it to be adapted to handle more general nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity theory of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in a Lipschitz domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation $-\Delta u=f(X)\cdot u^{-\gamma}$ in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, where $u=0 \ \mbox{on}\ \partial\Omega$ and $f \in C^\alpha(\Omega)$. A distinguishing feature of this problem is that the vanishing boundary value makes the equation singular. Our focus is on the well-posedness of the equation and its growth rate near the boundary with zero boundary data. We also discuss the boundary Harnack principle of the equation. Our results provide new insights into singular elliptic equations in non-smooth domains.</description>

      <title>An Orlicz space approach to exponential elliptic problems in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semilinear elliptic problems of the form \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = f(x,u), \quad u\in H^1_0(A), \] where $A\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq3$, is either a bounded or unbounded annulus, and $\lambda \geq0$. We study a broad class of nonlinearities $f$ with superlinear growth at infinity, including exponential- and power-type ones. Under suitable assumptions, we establish the existence of a positive nonradial solution via techniques in the spirit of Szulkin's nonsmooth critical point theory, applied within a convex cone in Orlicz spaces. Notably, the Trudinger-Moser inequality fails in the whole Sobolev space $H^1_0(A)$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Strong Convergence in Ideal Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strong convergence of weak solutions to the two-dimensional Quasi-Geostrophic Shallow-Water (QGSW) equation as the inverse Rossby radius tends to zero. In this limit, we recover the Yudovich solution of the incompressible Euler equations.
  We prove that the vorticity convergence holds in $L^\infty_t L^p_x$, for any finite integrability exponent $p&lt;\infty$. This extends to the case $p=\infty$ provided that the initial vorticities are continuous and converge uniformly. We also discuss the sharpness of this limit by demonstrating that the continuity assumption on the initial data is necessary for the endpoint convergence in $L^\infty_{t,x}$.
  The proof of the strong convergence relies on the {\em Extrapolation Compactness} method, recently introduced by Ars\'enio and the first author to address similar stability questions for the Euler equations. The approach begins with establishing the convergence in a lower regularity space, at first. Then, in a later step, the convergence to Yudovich's vorticity of Euler equations in Lebesgue spaces comes as a consequence of a careful analysis of the evanescence of specific high Fourier modes of the QGSW vorticity. A central challenge arises from the absence of a velocity formulation for QGSW, which we overcome by employing advanced tools from Littlewood Paley theory in endpoint settings.
  The sharpness of the convergence in the endpoint $L^\infty_{t,x}$ case is obtained in the context of vortex patches, drawing insights from key findings on uniformly rotating and stationary solutions of active scalar equations.</description>

      <title>Modulated phases in Ising systems with long-range antiferromagnetic and short-range ferromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider large spin systems with short-range ferromagnetic interactions and long-range antiferromagnetic interactions subjected to periodic boundary conditions which have been proved by Giuliani, Lebowitz and Lieb to have minimizers that tend to alternate groups of $1$ and $-1$ of the same length $h^\star$. We consider states with energy of the same order as that of minimizers and show that they consist of a finite number of modulated phases of the same form as minimizers with some interfacial defects. The analysis is carried out using the notation of Gamma-convergence by exhibiting an interfacial energy that describes the minimal defect energy between different modulated phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the preprint [Kiselev-Sarsam, arXiv:2412.16376], the authors proved the local well-posedness for this 1D periodic IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of smooth initial data. In this paper, we present several new weighted integral inequalities for the transform $H_a$ in the setting of the real line. Based on these integral inequalities, we also prove the finite time blow-up for this 1D IPM model on the real line.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for the Navier-Stokes system in new critical mixed-norm Besov spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we proved the existence of a unique global mild solution of the d-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, for small initial data in Besov type spaces based on mixed-Lebesgue spaces; namely, mixed-norm Besov-Lebesgue spaces and also mixed-norm Fourier-Besov-Lebesgue spaces. The main tools are the Bernstein's type inequalities, Bony's paraproduct to estimate the bilinear term and a fixed point scheme in order to get the well-posedness. Our results complement and cover previous and recents result on (Fourier-)Besov spaces and, for instance, provide a new class of initial data possibly not included in BMO^{-1}(R^3) but continuously included in \dot{B}^{-1}_{\infty,infty}(R^3).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the relations between extendability of different classes of Sobolev $W^{1,1}$ and $BV$ functions from closed sets in general metric measure spaces. Under the assumption that the metric measure space satisfies a weak $(1,1)$-Poincar\'e inequality and measure doubling, we prove further properties for the extension sets. In the case of the Euclidean plane, we show that compact finitely connected $BV$-extension sets are always also $W^{1,1}$-extension sets. This is shown via a local quasiconvexity result for the complement of the extension set.</description>

      <title>Representation of Global Viscosity Solutions for Tonelli Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Lax-Oleinik operator $\mathcal{T}$ associated with the non-stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation $\partial_tu + H(t,x,\partial_xu) = \alpha_0$ for a Tonelli Hamiltonian $H$ and its \Mane critical value $\alpha_0$. It is known from the work of A. Fathi and J.N. Mather \cite{MR1792479} that the convergence of this semigroup fails in the non-autonomous framework.
  In this context, we study the action of $\mathcal{T}$ on its non-wandering set $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$. First, we show that $\mathcal{T}$ acts as an isometry on this set, and then we characterize $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as the set of global viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, i.e. solutions that are defined for all real times.
  Next, we introduce a generalized Peierls barrier $\underline{k}$ and a set of generalized static classes $\underline{\mathbb{M}}$ within the Mather set. Using these, we represent elements $u$ of $\Omega(\mathcal{T})$ as
  \begin{equation*}
  u(x) = \inf_{y \in \underline{\mathbb{M}}} \{ u(y) + \underline{k}(y,x) \}
  \end{equation*}
  We apply this representation formula to prove Fathi's convergence theorem for autonomous systems and provide a representation formula for $n$-periodic viscosity solutions. Additionally, we establish that the dynamics of non-wandering viscosity solutions are governed by the Lagrangian flow on the Mather set. Specifically, we show that if the Mather set consists solely of $N$-periodic orbits for some integer $N$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are $N$-periodic. Furthermore, we show that if the restriction of the Lagrangian flow to the Mather set is uniformly recurrent for a time sequence $p_n$, then all non-wandering viscosity solutions are uniformly recurrent for the same time sequence $p_n$.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>

      <title>Compact implicit high resolution numerical method for solving transport problems with sorption isotherms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates numerical methods to solve nonlinear transport problems characterized by various sorption isotherms with a focus on the Freundlich type of isotherms. We describe and compare second order accurate numerical schemes, focusing on implicit methods, to effectively model transport phenomena without stability restriction on the choice of time steps. Furthermore, a high resolution form of the method is proposed that limits a priori the second order accurate scheme towards first order accuracy to keep the values of numerical solutions in a physically acceptable range.
  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of high resolution methods in minimizing oscillations near discontinuities, thereby enhancing solution plausibility. The observed convergence rates confirm that the second order accurate schemes achieve expected accuracy for smooth solutions and that they yield significant improvements when compared with the results of the first order scheme. As the computational cost of the compact implicit method seems to be comparable to similar explicit ones with a clear profit of unconditional stability, this research provides a practical tool toward numerical simulations of nonlinear transport phenomena applicable in various fields such as contaminant transport in porous media or column liquid chromatography.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-FEM approximation with uniform conservation of the exponential stability for a class of anisotropic port-Hamiltonian system and its application to LQ control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a mixed finite element discretization for a class of boundary-damped anisotropic port-Hamiltonian systems. Using a multiplier method, we demonstrate that the resulting approximation model uniformly preserves the exponential stability of the uncontrolled system, establishing a lower bound for the exponential decay rate that is independent of the mesh size. This property is illustrated through the spatial discretization of a piezoelectric beam. Furthermore, we show how the uniform preservation of exponential stability by the proposed model aids in the convergence of controllers derived from an infinite-time linear quadratic control design, in comparison to models obtained from the standard finite-element method.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle and Geometric Condition for the Observability of Schr\"{o}dinger Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09592v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the exact observability of the Schr\"odinger equation with inverse-square potentials on the half-line. These conditions are derived from a Logvinenko-Sereda type theorem for generalized Fourier transform. Specifically, the generalized Fourier transform associated with the Schr\"odinger operator with inverse-square potentials on the half-line is the well-known Hankel transform. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset $\Omega$, such that a function whose Hankel transform is supported in a given interval can be bounded, in the $L^2$-norm, from above by its restriction to $\Omega$, with a constant independent of the position of the interval.</description>

      <title>On the regularity problem for parabolic operators and the role of half-time derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the following result on regularity of solutions of the second order parabolic equation $\partial_t u - \mbox{div} (A \nabla u)+B\cdot \nabla u=0$ on cylindrical domains of the form $\Omega=\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ where $\mathcal O\subset\mathbb R^n$ is a is a uniform domain (it satisfies both interior corkscrew and Harnack chain conditions) and has a boundary that is $n-1$-Ahlfors regular. Let $u$ be a solution of such PDE in $\Omega$ and the non-tangential maximal function of its gradient in spatial directions $\tilde{N}(\nabla u)$ belongs to $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ for some $p&gt;1$. Furthermore, assume that for $u|_{\partial\Omega}=f$ we have that $D^{1/2}_tf\in L^p(\partial\Omega)$. Then both $\tilde{N}(D^{1/2}_t u)$ and $\tilde{N}(D^{1/2}_tH_t u)$ also belong to $L^p(\partial\Omega)$, where $D^{1/2}_t$ and $H_t$ are the half-derivative and the Hilbert transform in the time variable, respectively. We expect this result will spur new developments in the study of solvability of the $L^p$ parabolic Regularity problem as thanks to it it is now possible to formulate the parabolic Regularity problem on a large class of time-varying domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical derivation of stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We consider many-particle systems with a Hamiltonian dynamics supplemented by a friction term and environmental noise. Both the interaction potential and the additional friction force are supposed to be long range in comparison with the typical distance between neighboring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of the stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations of a barotropic fluid. Moreover, we quantify the distance between particles and the limit in suitable in Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider degenerate Kirchhoff-type equations of the form \[-\phi(\Xi(u)) \left(\mathcal{A}(u)-|u|^{p-2}u\right) = f(x,u)\quad \text{in } \Omega,\] \[\phantom{aaiaaaaaaaaa}\phi (\Xi(u)) \mathcal{B}(u) \cdot \nu = g(x,u) \quad \text{on } \partial\Omega,\] where $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega$, $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the double phase operator given by \begin{align*} \mathcal{A}(u)=\operatorname{div} \left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + \mu(x) |\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u \right)\quad \text{for }u\in W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega), \end{align*} $\nu(x)$ is the outer unit normal of $\Omega$ at $x \in \partial\Omega$, \[\mathcal{B}(u)=|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u + \mu(x) |\nabla u|^{q-2}\nabla u,\] \[\phantom{aaaiaaaa}\Xi(u)= \int_\Omega \left(\frac{|\nabla u|^p+|u|^p}{p}+\mu(x) \frac{|\nabla u|^q}{q}\right)\,\mathrm{d} x,\] $1&lt;p&lt;N$, $p&lt;q&lt;p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, $0 \leq \mu(\cdot)\in L^\infty(\Omega)$, $\phi(s) = a + b s^{\zeta-1}$ for $s\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a \geq 0$, $b&gt;0$ and $\zeta \geq 1$, and $f\colon\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, $g\colon\partial\Omega\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ are Carath\'{e}odory functions that grow superlinearly and subcritically. We prove the existence of a nodal ground state solution to the problem above, based on variational methods and minimization of the associated energy functional $\mathcal{E}\colon W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega) \to\mathbb{R}$ over the constraint set \[\mathcal{C}=\Big\{u \in W^{1,\mathcal{H}}(\Omega)\colon u^{\pm}\neq 0,\, \left\langle \mathcal{E}'(u),u^+ \right\rangle= \left\langle \mathcal{E}'(u),-u^- \right\rangle=0 \Big\},\] whereby $\mathcal{C}$ differs from the well-known nodal Nehari manifold due to the nonlocal character of the problem.</description>

      <title>Hardy and Rellich identities and inequalities for Baouendi-Grushin operators via spherical vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Baouendi-Grushin vector fields, we prove Hardy, Hardy-Rellich, and Rellich identities and inequalities with sharp constants. Our explicit remainder terms significantly improve than those found in the literature. Our arguments are built on abstract Hardy-Rellich identities involving the Bessel pair along with the use of spherical harmonics developed by Garofalo-Shen [Ann. Inst. Fourier (1994)]. Furthermore, in the spirit of Bez-Machihara-Ozawa [Math. Z (2023)], we construct spherical vector fields corresponding to the Baouendi-Grushin vector fields and prove identities that, in turn, establish optimal Rellich identities, by comparing the Baouendi-Grushin operator with its radial and spherical components. We give alternate proofs of Hardy identities and inequalities with enhanced Hardy constants in some subspaces of the Sobolev space, among other things. Additionally, we compute the deficit involving the $L^2$-norm of the Baouendi-Grushin operator and its radial component with an explicit remainder term, which leads to a comparison of the Baouendi-Grushin operator with its radial components. As a consequence of the main results, new second-order Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principles and Hydrogen uncertainty principles are also derived. Furthermore, we also derive certain symmetrization principles green corresponding to the Baouendi-Grushin vector fields.</description>

Abstract: We consider the relativistic, spatially inhomogeneous Fokker-Planck equation with an external confining potential. We prove the exponential time decay of solutions towards the global equilibrium in weighted $L^2$ and Sobolov spaces. Our result holds for a wide class of external potentials and the estimates on the rate of convergence are explicit and constructive. Moreover, we prove that the associated semigroup of the equation has hypoelliptic regularizing properties and we obtain explicit rates on this regularization. The technique is based on the construction of suitable Lyapunov functionals.</description>

      <title>Convex waves grazing convex obstacles to high order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper [WW23] we studied the transport of oscillations in solutions to linear and some semilinear second-order hyperbolic boundary problems along rays that graze a convex obstacle to any order. We showed that high frequency exact solutions are well approximated in $H^1$ by much simpler approximate solutions constructed from explicit solutions to profile equations. That result depends on two geometric assumptions, referred to here as the grazing set (GS) and reflected flow map (RFM) assumptions, that are both difficult to verify in general. The GS assumption states that the grazing set, that is, the set of points on the spacetime boundary at which incoming characteristics meet the boundary tangentially, is a codimension two, $C^1$ submanifold of spacetime. The second is that the reflected flow map, which sends points on the spacetime boundary forward in time to points on reflected and grazing rays, is injective and has appropriate regularity properties near the grazing set. In this paper we analyze these assumptions for incoming plane, spherical, and more general ``convex waves" when the governing hyperbolic operator is the wave operator $\Box:=\Delta-\partial_t^2$. We prove general results describing when the assumptions hold, and provide explicit examples where the GS assumption fails.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider an n-dimensional parabolic partial differential equation with a smooth coefficient term in the nonlinear gradient term.

Here, leveraging a virial-type estimate, we provide a positive answer to this question within the framework of smooth solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric flow framework to investigate the following two classical shape functionals: the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. First, by constructing novel deformation paths governed by stretching flows, we prove several new monotonicity properties of the torsional rigidity and the first eigenvalue along the evolutions restricted to triangles and rhombuses. These results also lead to new and simpler proofs of some known results, unifying and extending prior symmetrization-based proofs. Second, utilizing the mean curvature flow, we give a new proof of the Saint-Venant inequality for smooth convex bodies. This might represent the first flow-based proof to establish geometric functional inequalities that couple both the domain and the state function associated with it. Third, by discovering a gradient norm inequality for the sides of rectangles, we prove monotonicity and stronger rigidity results of the torsional rigidity on rectangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a family of curve evolution equations approximating the motion of a Kirchhoff rod immersed in a low Reynolds number fluid. The rod is modeled as a framed curve whose energy consists of the bending energy of the curve and the twisting energy of the frame. The equations we consider may be realized as gradient flows of the rod energy under a certain anisotropic metric coming from resistive force theory. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the PDE theory of immersed rod dynamics. We begin by analyzing the problem without the frame, in which case the evolution is globally well-posed and solutions asymptotically converge to Euler elasticae. Next, in the planar setting, we demonstrate the existence of large time-periodic solutions forced by intrinsic curvature relevant to undulatory swimming. Finally, the majority of the paper is devoted to the evolution of an immersed Kirchhoff rod in 3D, which involves a strong coupling between the curve and frame. Under a physically reasonable assumption on the curvature, solutions exist globally-in-time and asymptotically converge to rod equilibria.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the potential theory of Dirichlet forms on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d_+$ defined by the jump kernel $J(x,y)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ and the killing potential $\kappa x_d^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and $\mathcal{B}(x,y)$ can blow up to infinity at the boundary. The jump kernel and the killing potential depend on several parameters. For all admissible values of the parameters involved and all $d \ge 1$, we prove that the boundary Harnack principle holds, and establish sharp two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these processes.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximations overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of general semilinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neufeld and Wu (arXiv:2310.12545) developed a multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithm which can approximately solve general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities, allowing also for coefficient functions of the corresponding PDE to be non-constant. By introducing a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula and identifying the first and second component of the unique fixed-point of the SFPE with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE and its gradient, they proved convergence of their algorithm. However, it remained an open question whether the proposed MLP schema in arXiv:2310.12545 does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we prove that the MLP algorithm in arXiv:2310.12545 indeed can overcome the curse of dimensionality, i.e. that its computational complexity only grows polynomially in the dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the accuracy $\varepsilon$, under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear part of the corresponding PDE.</description>

      <title>Constrained differential operators, Sobolev inequalities, and Riesz potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms "far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. This work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. Indeed, under the same differential constraint, a Riesz potential inequality is shown to hold for any domain and target rearrangement-invariant norms that render a Sobolev inequality of the same order true. This is based on a new interpolation inequality, which, via a kind of duality argument, yields a parallel property of Sobolev inequalities for any linear homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator. Specifically, Sobolev inequalities involving the full gradient of a certain order share the same rearrangement-invariant domain and target spaces as their analogs for any other homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator of equal order. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint and Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fuchsian flows and the coupled vortex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>
