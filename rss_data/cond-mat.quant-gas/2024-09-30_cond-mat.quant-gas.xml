      <title>Engineering quantum droplet formation by cavity-induced long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dilute Bose gas with both a short-range contact and an effective long-range interaction between the atoms. The latter is induced by the strong coupling to a cavity light mode and is spatially characterized by a periodic signature and a tunable envelope rooted in the pumping of the cavity. We formulate a Bogoliubov theory which is based on a homogeneous mean-field description and quantum fluctuations around it. We find that the repulsive mean-field contact interaction could be destabilized by quantum fluctuation corrections rooting in the long-range interaction. The competition between both allows for the formation of self-bound quantum droplets. This generic approach is applied to two cavity setups without and with a momentum-conserving effective long-range interaction between the atoms in the form of a driven dispersive cavity mode and a multimode cavity, respectively. For both cases we show analytically how the size and the central density of the cavity-induced quantum droplets depend on the contact interaction strength and on the shape of the spatial envelope of the long-range interaction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning out of equilibrium correlations in the Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems theoretically is a challenging problem. Essentially exact results can be obtained for the out-of-equilibrium correlations in the Bose-Hubbard model in one dimension, but higher dimensions require approximate methods. One such method is the two-particle irreducible strong coupling (2PISC) approach [M.R.C. Fitzpatrick and M.P. Kennett, Nucl. Phys. B 930, 1 (2018)]. Calculations of the single-particle correlations using this method yield values of the velocity for correlation spreading that match well with exact methods in one dimension and experiments in one and two dimensions. However, the 2PISC method is less accurate for determining the amplitude of correlations, especially in the regime where interactions are not very strong. Viewing the calculation of the single-particle correlations as an image correction problem, we train a neural network (NN) to take input from the 2PISC approach to reproduce the output of exact diagonalization calculations. We show that the predictions of the NN improve on 2PISC results for parameters outside the training region. Our approach is not specific to the Bose-Hubbard model and may find application to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>First Principle Predictions for Cold Fermionic Gases Near Criticality via Critical Boson Dominance and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the authors have developed an effective field theory formalism to systematically describe cold fermionic gases near the unitary limit. The theory has enhanced predictive power due to the fact that interactions are dominated by the exchange of a gapped critical boson whose couplings and mass are fixed by matching the dilatation anomaly between the UV and IR theories. We utilize this theory to give analytic predictions for the compressibility and magnetic susceptibility for fermions near unitarity with attractive interactions above the critical temperature $T_c$, with a well defined theoretical error. The inputs to the predictions are: the scattering length $a$, the effective mass $m^\star$ and contact parameter $\tilde C(a)$. We then compare our predictions to numerical simulations and find excellent agreement within the window of scattering lengths where the EFT is valid ($10\geq \mid \! k_F a \! \mid\geq 1$). Experimental corroboration of this theory supports critical point that can be describe by the inclusion of a scalar dilaton mode, whose action is fixed by symmetries.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based learning of Quantum phase transitions in the two-component Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of autoencoders and machine learning methods for detecting and analyzing quantum phase transitions in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model. By leveraging deep learning models such as autoencoders, we investigate latent space representations, reconstruction error analysis, and cluster distance calculations to identify phase boundaries and critical points. The study is supplemented by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE for latent space visualization. The results demonstrate the potential of autoencoders to describe the dynamics of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnifying the Wave Function of Interacting Fermionic Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding many body systems is a key challenge in physics. Single atom resolved imaging techniques have unlocked access to microscopic correlations in ultracold quantum gases. However they cannot be used when the relevant length scales are obscured by the resolution of the detection technique. We present a matterwave magnification scheme, based on evolutions in optical potentials, tailored to magnify the wave function of atoms, such that all length scales can be resolved. To showcase this method, we image atoms in the strongly interacting regime, establishing a new way to characterize correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of modulational instability and discrete breathers arising in a quasi-one-dimensional discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Conditions for modulation instability and instability regions of nonlinear plane waves are determined in parameter space. We analytically investigate the existence of different quantum droplet solutions, including intersite, onsite, front-like, flat-top and dark localized modes, using the Page method and variational approach. Their stability is checked using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations. The analytical predictions corroborated with the numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy-momentum correlators of fermions at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equal-time commutators of different components of the energy-momentum tensor at spatially separated points are calculated for a relativistic quantum Fermi gas at finite temperature and density. Different definitions of such components, also known as different pseudogauges, are used and smeared with a Gaussian profile characterized by the width $\sigma$. In this way, we introduce observables that may represent measurements of energy and momentum in a spatial region of size $\sigma$. We find that the obtained commutators are sensitive to the pseudogauge chosen if the probed systems or the spatial separation are small. The pseudogauge dependence is expected as different quantum operators are analyzed in this case. On the other hand, we find that for sufficiently large probed systems or with large separation, the studied commutators are pseudogauge independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an optomechanical formalism for macroscopic quantum states in exciton-polariton systems with strong exciton-phonon interactions. We show that polariton optomechanical interactions induce dynamical backaction, resulting in dispersive and dissipative shifts in the complex vibrational response functions. Unlike conventional optomechanical systems, polariton optomechanics features high-dimensionality and phase-space confinement due to the dispersion relations of exciton-polaritons. Consequently, vibrational modes exhibit effective positive or negative mass depending on the detuning parameter, and are capable for the nonequilibrium vibrational Bose-Einstein condensation under the resonant conditions [arXiv:2309.08498]. We demonstrate the potential for vibrational control of polariton condensates at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>
