      <title>Automated model discovery of finite strain elastoplasticity from uniaxial experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constitutive modeling lies at the core of mechanics, allowing us to map strains onto stresses for a material in a given mechanical setting. Historically, researchers relied on phenomenological modeling where simple mathematical relationships were derived through experimentation and curve fitting. Recently, to automate the constitutive modeling process, data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been explored. While initial naive approaches violated established mechanical principles, recent efforts concentrate on designing neural network architectures that incorporate physics and mechanistic assumptions into machine-learning-based constitutive models. For history-dependent materials, these models have so far predominantly been restricted to small-strain formulations. In this work, we develop a finite strain plasticity formulation based on thermodynamic potentials to model mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening. We then leverage physics-augmented neural networks to automate the discovery of thermodynamically consistent constitutive models of finite strain elastoplasticity from uniaxial experiments. We apply the framework to both synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to capture complex material behavior under cyclic uniaxial loading. Furthermore, we show that the neural network enhanced model trains easier than traditional phenomenological models as it is less sensitive to varying initial seeds. our model's ability to generalize beyond the training set underscores its robustness and predictive power. By automating the discovery of hardening models, our approach eliminates user bias and ensures that the resulting constitutive model complies with thermodynamic principles, thus offering a more systematic and physics-informed framework.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Data Democratization: A Multifaceted Investment for an Equitable Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urgent need for data democratization in scientific research was the focal point of a panel discussion at SC23 in Denver, Colorado, from November 12 to 17, 2023. This article summarizes the outcomes of that discussion and subsequent conversations. We advocate for strategic investments in financial, human, and technological resources for sustainable data democratization. Emphasizing that data is central to scientific discovery and AI deployment, we highlight barriers such as limited access, inadequate financial incentives for cross-domain collaboration, and a shortage of workforce development initiatives. Our recommendations aim to guide decision-makers in fostering an inclusive research community, breaking down research silos, and developing a skilled workforce to advance scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear phase-field model of corrosion with charging kinetics of electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear phase-field model is developed to simulate corrosion damage. The motion of the electrode$-$ electrolyte interface follows the usual kinetic rate theory for chemical reactions based on the Butler-Volmer equation. The model links the surface polarization variation associated with the charging kinetics of an electric double layer (EDL) to the mesoscale transport. The effects of the EDL are integrated as a boundary condition on the solution potential equation. The boundary condition controls the magnitude of the solution potential at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ion concentration field outside the EDL is obtained by solving the electro-diffusion equation and Ohm's law for the solution potential. The model is validated against the classic benchmark pencil electrode test. The framework developed reproduces experimental measurements of both pit kinetics and transient current density response. The model enables more accurate information on corrosion damage, current density, and environmental response in terms of the distribution of electric potential and charged species. The sensitivity analysis for different properties of the EDL is performed to investigate their role in the electrochemical response of the system. Simulation results show that the properties of the EDL significantly influence the transport of ionic species in the electrolyte.</description>

      <title>Tripl\`etoile: Extraction of Knowledge from Microblogging Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous methods and pipelines have recently emerged for the automatic extraction of knowledge graphs from documents such as scientific publications and patents. However, adapting these methods to incorporate alternative text sources like micro-blogging posts and news has proven challenging as they struggle to model open-domain entities and relations, typically found in these sources. In this paper, we propose an enhanced information extraction pipeline tailored to the extraction of a knowledge graph comprising open-domain entities from micro-blogging posts on social media platforms. Our pipeline leverages dependency parsing and classifies entity relations in an unsupervised manner through hierarchical clustering over word embeddings. We provide a use case on extracting semantic triples from a corpus of 100 thousand tweets about digital transformation and publicly release the generated knowledge graph. On the same dataset, we conduct two experimental evaluations, showing that the system produces triples with precision over 95% and outperforms similar pipelines of around 5% in terms of precision, while generating a comparatively higher number of triples.</description>
