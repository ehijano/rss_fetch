      <title>Rigorous Implications of the Low-Degree Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the low-degree heuristic has been used to estimate the algorithmic thresholds for a wide range of average-case planted vs null distinguishing problems. Such results rely on the hypothesis that if the low-degree moments of the planted and null distributions are sufficiently close, then no efficient (noise-tolerant) algorithm can distinguish between them. This hypothesis is appealing due to the simplicity of calculating the low-degree likelihood ratio (LDLR) -- a quantity that measures the similarity between low-degree moments. However, despite sustained interest in the area, it remains unclear whether low-degree indistinguishability actually rules out any interesting class of algorithms.
  In this work, we initiate the study and develop technical tools for translating LDLR upper bounds to rigorous lower bounds against concrete algorithms. As a consequence, we prove: for any permutation-invariant distribution $\mathsf{P}$,
  1. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\{0,1\}^n$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from $U = \mathrm{Unif}(\{0,1\}^n)$, then a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ is statistically indistinguishable from $U$.
  2. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\mathbb{R}^n$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from the standard Gaussian ${N}(0, 1)^n$, then no statistic based on symmetric polynomials of degree at most $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ can distinguish between a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ from ${N}(0, 1)^n$.
  3. If $\mathsf{P}$ is over $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and is low-degree indistinguishable from ${N}(0,1)^{n\times n}$, then no constant-sized subgraph statistic can distinguish between a noisy version of $\mathsf{P}$ and ${N}(0, 1)^{n\times n}$.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience for Digraph Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a complexity dichotomy for the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive digraph queries (i.e., for existential positive sentences over the signature $\{R\}$ of directed graphs). Specifically, for every union $\mu$ of conjunctive digraph queries, the following problem is in P or NP-complete: given a directed multigraph $G$ and a natural number $u$, can we remove $u$ edges from $G$ so that $G \models \neg \mu$? In fact, we verify a more general dichotomy conjecture from (Bodirsky et al., 2024) for all resilience problems in the special case of directed graphs, and show that for such unions of queries $\mu$ there exists a countably infinite ('dual') valued structure $\Delta_\mu$ which either primitively positively constructs 1-in-3-3-SAT, and hence the resilience problem for $\mu$ is NP-complete by general principles, or has a pseudo cyclic canonical fractional polymorphism, and the resilience problem for $\mu$ is in P.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>

      <title>When quantum resources backfire: Non-gaussianity and symplectic coherence in noisy bosonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the impact of noise is of fundamental importance to understand the advantages provided by quantum systems. While the classical simulability of noisy discrete-variable systems is increasingly well understood, noisy bosonic circuits are more challenging to simulate and analyze. Here, we address this gap by introducing the $\textit{displacement propagation}$ algorithm, a continuous-variable analogue of Pauli propagation for simulating noisy bosonic circuits. By exploring the interplay of noise and quantum resources, we identify several computational phase transitions, revealing regimes where even modest noise levels render bosonic circuits efficiently classically simulable. In particular, our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: computational resources usually associated with bosonic quantum advantage, namely non-Gaussianity and symplectic coherence, can make the system easier to classically simulate in presence of noise.</description>
