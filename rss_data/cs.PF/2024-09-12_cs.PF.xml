      <title>Kino-PAX: Highly Parallel Kinodynamic Sampling-based Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are effective for planning with complex kinodynamic constraints in high-dimensional spaces, but they still struggle to achieve real-time performance, which is mainly due to their serial computation design. We present Kinodynamic Parallel Accelerated eXpansion (Kino-PAX), a novel highly parallel kinodynamic SBMP designed for parallel devices such as GPUs. Kino-PAX grows a tree of trajectory segments directly in parallel. Our key insight is how to decompose the iterative tree growth process into three massively parallel subroutines. Kino-PAX is designed to align with the parallel device execution hierarchies, through ensuring that threads are largely independent, share equal workloads, and take advantage of low-latency resources while minimizing high-latency data transfers and process synchronization. This design results in a very efficient GPU implementation. We prove that Kino-PAX is probabilistically complete and analyze its scalability with compute hardware improvements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate solutions in the order of 10 ms on a desktop GPU and in the order of 100 ms on an embedded GPU, representing up to 1000 times improvement compared to coarse-grained CPU parallelization of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms over a range of complex environments and systems.</description>

      <title>Applied Federated Model Personalisation in the Industrial Domain: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-consuming nature of training and deploying complicated Machine and Deep Learning (DL) models for a variety of applications continues to pose significant challenges in the field of Machine Learning (ML). These challenges are particularly pronounced in the federated domain, where optimizing models for individual nodes poses significant difficulty. Many methods have been developed to tackle this problem, aiming to reduce training expenses and time while maintaining efficient optimisation. Three suggested strategies to tackle this challenge include Active Learning, Knowledge Distillation, and Local Memorization. These methods enable the adoption of smaller models that require fewer computational resources and allow for model personalization with local insights, thereby improving the effectiveness of current models. The present study delves into the fundamental principles of these three approaches and proposes an advanced Federated Learning System that utilises different Personalisation methods towards improving the accuracy of AI models and enhancing user experience in real-time NG-IoT applications, investigating the efficacy of these techniques in the local and federated domain. The results of the original and optimised models are then compared in both local and federated contexts using a comparison analysis. The post-analysis shows encouraging outcomes when it comes to optimising and personalising the models with the suggested techniques.</description>

      <title>An In-Depth Investigation of LEO Satellite Topology Design Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are rapidly gaining traction today. Although several real-world deployments exist, our preliminary analysis of LEO topology performance with the soon-to-be operational Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) reveals several interesting characteristics that are difficult to explain based on our current understanding of topologies. For example, a real-world satellite shell with a low density of satellites offers better latency performance than another shell with nearly double the number of satellites. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of LEO satellite topology design parameters and their impact on network performance while using the ISLs. In particular, we focus on three design parameters: the number of orbits in a shell, the inclination of orbits, and the number of satellites per orbit. Through an extensive analysis of real-world and synthetic satellite configurations, we uncover several interesting properties of satellite topologies. Notably, there exist thresholds for the number of satellites per orbit and the number of orbits below which the latency performance degrades significantly. Moreover, network delay between a pair of traffic endpoints depends on the alignment of the satellite's orbit (Inclination) with the geographic locations of endpoints.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Reality: 5G Positioning with Open-Source Implementation of UL-TDoA in OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an open-source implementation of the 3GPP Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) positioning method using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. UL-TDoA is a critical positioning technique in 5G networks, leveraging the time differences of signal arrival at multiple base stations to determine the precise location of User Equipment (UE). This implementation aims to democratize access to advanced positioning technology by integrating UL-TDoA capabilities into both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) components of OAI, providing a comprehensive and 3GPP-compliant solution. The development includes the incorporation of essential protocol procedures, message flows, and interfaces as defined by 3GPP standards. Validation is conducted using two distinct methods: an OAI-RF simulator-based setup for controlled testing and an O-RAN-based Localization Testbed at EURECOM in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate the viability of this open-source UL-TDoA implementation, enabling precise positioning in various environments. By making this implementation publicly available, the study paves the way for widespread research, development, and innovation in the field of 5G positioning technologies, fostering collaboration and accelerating the advancement of cellular network positioning.</description>
