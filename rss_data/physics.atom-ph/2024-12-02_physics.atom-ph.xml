      <title>Laser cooling trapped-ion crystal modes beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling methods for trapped ions are most commonly studied at low energies, i.e., in the Lamb-Dicke regime. However, ions in experiments are often excited to higher energies for which the Lamb-Dicke approximation breaks down. Here we construct a non-perturbative, semiclassical method for predicting the energy-dependent cooling dynamics of trapped-ion crystals with potentially many internal levels and motional modes beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. This method allows accurate and efficient modeling of a variety of interesting phenomena, such as the breakdown of EIT cooling at high energies and the simultaneous cooling of multiple high-temperature modes. We compare its predictions both to fully-quantum simulations and to experimental data for a broadband EIT cooling method on a Raman $S$-$D$ transition in $^{138}$Ba${^+}$. We find the method can accurately predict cooling rates over a wide range of energies relevant to trapped ion experiments. Our method complements fully quantum models by allowing for fast and accurate predictions of laser-cooling dynamics at much higher energy scales.</description>

      <title>Photon Angular Distribution in Two-Photon Electron Capture by H-Like Uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the angular distribution of photons emitted during the resonant two-photon electron capture by H-like uranium ions. Focusing on the energies of incident electrons, at which the dielectronic recombination (DR) dominates, we analyze the angular emission spectrum of the most significant cascade transitions, which make the main contribution to the total cross section. In particular, we consider the cascade transitions that occur with the formation of $(1s2s)$ and $(1s2p)$ intermediate states. We investigate the angular distribution of the emitted photons beyond the single-photon approximation. We separately consider the contributions of the DR and the radiation recombination (RR) channels and demonstrate that the two-photon angular distribution shows strong interference between these channels.</description>

      <title>One-loop electron self-energy with accelerated partial-wave expansion in Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of the electron self-energy without any expansion in the binding nuclear field are required in order to match the rapidly advancing precision of experimental spectroscopy. For the lightest elements, particularly hydrogen, these computations are complicated by large numerical cancellations and the slow convergence of the partial-wave expansion. Methods with accelerated convergence of the partial-wave expansion have been recently put forward [V. A. Yerokhin, K. Pachucki, V. M. Shabaev, Phys. Rev. A 72, 042502 (2005); J. Sapirstein and K. T. Cheng, Phys. Rev. A 108, 042804 (2023)]. In our work we extend the accelerated-convergence methods to the previously hardly accessible region of nuclear charges $Z &lt; 5$ and higher excited states.</description>

      <title>Nuclear and Particle Physics through Quantum Sensing Using Cold Atoms and Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As techniques for manipulating single atoms and molecules developed, quantum technologies witnessed drastic advancements. These technologies are now so mature that they can be applied to various fields. One of such fields is nuclear and particle physics, which were conventionally investigated with high energy accelerators. In general, quantum sensing enables high-precision measurements, opening ways to investigate high-energy phenomena that slightly modify energy levels of low-energy systems by higher-order perturbations. In other cases, such high-precision measurements are sensitive to faint low-energy interactions between the low-energy system and exotic fields. These measurements open new parameter spaces to explore in conventionally investigated topics, e.g., variations of fundamental constants, dark matter, fifth force, parity violation, CP-violation, supersymmetric theories, and other physics beyond the Standard Model. Additionally, such measurements can serve as confirmations for existing results from completely different systems, or surpass existing results using smaller-scale experiments. The field of atomic and molecular physics oriented to nuclear and particle physics motivations evolved significantly. This paper provides an overview of the field of nuclear and particle physics through high-precision quantum measurements using atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields I: symmetry and dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism. Using the strong-field approximation, we assess how the symmetries of the field influence the dominant events. Furthermore, we show that, by manipulating the field parameters such as the field frequencies and relative phase between the two driving waves, one can influence the correlated electron-momentum distributions. Specific features of a linearly polarized bichromatic field are that the momentum distributions of the second electron are no longer centered around vanishing momenta and that there may be more than one ionization event per half cycle. This can be used to confine the RESI distributions to specific momentum regions and to determine a hierarchy of parameters that make an event dominant.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Optical Ramsey-Doppler Spectroscopy of Positronium and Muonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positronium and muonium, as purely leptonic atoms without internal structure, provide ideal systems for high-precision tests of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and measurements of fundamental constants. However, the high velocities of these lightweight atoms complicate precision spectroscopy, particularly in the 1S-2S transition, due to transit time broadening and second-order Doppler shifts. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method combining two-photon Ramsey spectroscopy with a technique to correct the second-order Doppler shifts on an atom-by-atom basis. Additionally, this approach suppresses systematic effects of the AC Stark shift to a negligible level compared to the target precision. Simulations predict that for both positronium and muonium, this method could improve the measurement precision of the 1S-2S transition by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art. This approach opens up new avenues for rigorous bound-state QED tests and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Coherent deflection of atomic samples and positional mesoscopic superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.</description>

      <title>A Trade-Off Between Path Entanglement and Quantum Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>How Are Quantum Eigenfunctions of Hydrogen Atom Related To Its Classical Elliptic Orbits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a highly-excited energy eigenfunction $\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})$ of hydrogen atom can be approximated as an equal-weight superposition of classical elliptic orbits of energy $E_n$ and angular momentum $L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, and $z$ component of angular momentum $L_z=m\hbar$. This correspondence is established by comparing the quantum probability distribution $|\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})|^2$ and the classical probability distribution $p_c(\vec{r})$ of an ensemble of such orbits. This finding illustrates a general principle: in the semi-classical limit, an energy eigenstate of a quantum system is in general reduced to a collection of classical orbits, rather than a single classical orbit. In light of this quantum-classical correspondence, we re-examine the classical singularity problem of a point mass falling toward a gravitational center. We find that Euler's intuition was correct: the mass point undergoes a sudden turn at the center.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. This mechanism may be extended to nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation or soft octupole vibration. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a binary quantum fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instabilities, where small fluctuations seed the formation of large-scale structures, govern dynamics in a variety of fluid systems. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the "ripplon" interface modes. Lastly, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results-in agreement with our theory-demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Long-distance chronometric leveling with a portable optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the geopotential difference between two locations separated by $457~\mathrm{km}$ by comparison of two optical lattice clocks via an interferometric fiber link, utilizing the gravitational redshift of the clock transition frequency. The $^{87}$Sr clocks have been compared side-by-side before and after one of the clocks was moved to the remote location. The chronometrically measured geopotential difference of $3918.1(2.6)\,\mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-2}}$ agrees with an independent geodetic determination of $3915.88(0.30)\,\mathrm{m^2 \, s^{-2}}$. The uncertainty of the chronometric geopotential difference is equivalent to an uncertainty of $27~\mathrm{cm}$ in height.</description>
