      <title>ASASSN-24fw: An 8-month long, 4.1 mag, optically achromatic and polarized dimming event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss ASASSN-24fw, a 13th-magnitude star that optically faded by $\Delta g = 4.12 \pm 0.02$ mag starting in September 2024 after over a decade of quiescence in ASAS-SN. The dimmimg lasted $\sim$8 months before returning to quiescence in late May 2025. The spectral energy distribution (SED) before the event is that of a pre-main sequence or a modestly evolved F star with some warm dust emission. The shape of the optical SED during the dim phase is unchanged and the optical and near-infrared spectra are those of an F star. The SED and the dilution of some of the F star infrared absorption features near minimum suggest the presence of a $\sim$0.25$M_\odot$ M dwarf binary companion. The 43.8 year period proposed by Nair &amp; Denisenko (2024) appears correct and is probably half the precession period of a circumbinary disk. The optical eclipse is nearly achromatic, although slightly deeper in bluer filters, $\Delta (g-z)=0.31\pm0.15$ mag, and the $V$ band emission is polarized by up to 4%. The materials most able to produce such small optical color changes and a high polarization are big ($\sim$20 $\mu$m) carbonaceous or water ice grains. Particle distributions dominated by big grains are seen in protoplanetary disks, Saturn-like ring systems and evolved debris disks. We also carry out a survey of occultation events, finding 42 additional systems, of which only 7 (4) closely match $\varepsilon$ Aurigae (KH 15D), the two archetypes of stars with long and deep eclipses. The full sample is widely distributed in an optical color-magnitude diagram, but roughly half show a mid-IR excess. It is likely many of the others have cooler dust since it seems essential to produce the events.</description>

      <title>Linearity of Structure Kernels in Main-sequence and Subgiant Solar-like Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic structure inversions have been used to study the solar interior for decades. With the high-precision frequencies obtained using data from the Kepler mission, it has now become possible to study other solar-like oscillators using structure inversions, including both main-sequence and subgiant stars. Subgiant stars are particularly interesting because they exhibit modes of mixed acoustic-buoyancy nature, which provide the opportunity to probe the deeper region of stellar cores. This work examines whether the structure inversion techniques developed for the pure acoustic modes of the Sun and other main-sequence stars are still valid for mixed modes observed in subgiant stars. We construct two grids of models: one of main-sequence stars and one of early subgiant stars. Using these grids, we examine two different parts of the inversion procedure. First, we examine what we call the "kernel errors", which measure how well the mode sensitivity functions can recover known frequency differences between two models. Second, we test how these kernel errors affect the ability of an inversion to infer known structure differences. On the main sequence, we find that reliable structure inversion results can be obtained across the entire range of masses and large frequency separations we consider. On the subgiant branch, however, the rapid evolution of mixed modes leads to large kernel errors and hence difficulty recovering known structure differences. Our tests show that using mixed modes to infer the structure of subgiant stars reliably will require improvements to current fitting approaches and modifications to the structure inversion techniques.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of white-light flare accompanied by probable postflare loops on M-type dwarf EV Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White-light flares are explosive phenomena accompanied by brightening of continuum from near-ultraviolet to optical, which occur on the Sun and stars. In order to investigate the mechanism of white-light flares, we carried out simultaneous optical photometry (TESS : 6000-10000 \r{A}) and spectroscopy (Seimei Telescope : 4100-8900 \r{A}) of a M-dwarf EV Lac on 2019 September 14. We detected a flare with high-time-cadence ($\sim 50$ sec) spectroscopic observation. At the peak, the continuum of the flare component is well fitted by a blackbody spectrum with temperature of $T = 8122 \pm 273$ K, which is comparable with the results of previous studies that reported the spectral energy distribution of near-ultraviolet to optical during the flare could be approximated by single-temperature blackbody radiation at $T \sim 10^{4}$ K. We also estimated the time evolution of the flare temperature during the decay phase. The radiative energy of this flare within the optical range is $4.4 \times 10^{32}$ erg, taking into account the time-dependent variation in the decreasing flare temperature and expanding flare area. Furthermore, we detected a delayed increase in the flux of H$\alpha$ after the photometric flare peak, secondary increase, and gradual increase even after the white-light flare ended. Comparison of our results with light curves obtained by the Sun-as-a-star analysis of solar flares indicates that these signals may be due to postflare loops near the stellar limb. Our result about time evolution of white-light continuum will help to gain more insight into the mechanism of white-light flares both on the Sun and stars. Additionally, since extreme ultraviolet radiation from flare loops plays a key role in planetary atmospheric escape, the existence of postflare loops on stellar flares and its time evolution will help future studies about habitability of close-in planets.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Solar Eruptions via Enhanced Torus Instability Driven by Small-Scale Flux Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the fundamental processes involved in the initiation and acceleration of solar eruptions remain not fully understood, making them long-standing and challenging problems in solar physics. Recent high-resolution observations by the Goode Solar Telescope have revealed small-scale magnetic flux emergence in localized regions of solar active areas prior to eruptions. Although much smaller in size than the entire active region, these emerging fluxes reached strengths of up to 2000 G. To investigate their impact, we performed data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We find that while the small-scale emerging flux does not significantly alter the pre-eruption evolution, it dramatically accelerates the eruption during the main phase by enhancing the growth of torus instability, which emerges in the nonlinear stage. This enhancement occurs independently of the decay index profile. Our analysis indicates that even subtle differences in the pre-eruption evolution can strongly influence the subsequent dynamics, suggesting that small-scale emerging flux can play a critical role in accelerating solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>CME activities on spotless days during descending phase of solar cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spotless days (SLDs) as well as CMEs in the decay phase of the solar cycle are believed to be a good predictor of the forthcoming cycle. A sequential increase in SLDs is observed since cycle 21, and cycle 24 has the highest number of SLDs (since cycle 14), which offers a unique opportunity to probe the CME characteristics that occurred during SLDs (hereafter CME_SLD), in a statistical sense. Here, we investigate the CME_SLD during the descending phases of solar cycles 23 (2004-2008) and 24 (2015-2019). The fraction of CMEs that occurred on SLDs is found to be 14 and 11%, for cycles 23 and 24, respectively, compared to the total CMEs that occurred in the aforementioned durations. CME_SLD that occurred on the visible side of the solar disk are found to be slower, smaller in width, and carrying low Kinetic energy and mass compared to the entire population of CMEs. The distribution of annual evolution of speed, angular width and acceleration of the CMESLD with the CMEs that occurred on the non-SLD days (hereafter CME_Non-SLD) for the descending phases shows that the CME_SLD are different from the CME_non-SLD in terms of characteristics (such as speed, width and acceleration). A comparative analysis of CME_SLD kinematics of cycle 23 and 24 shows that the weakest cycle 24 has wider and more massive events. In contrast, other parameters of CME_SLD such as speed, acceleration and Kinetic energy do not have a disparate nature. CME_SLD in both SC23 and SC24 are statistically similar. Therefore, this investigation suggests that SLDs, and hence the sunspot number, may not be a sufficient candidate to predict the solar eruptive activities (e.g. CMEs). On the other hand, our analysis of the relation between the strength of the geomagnetic storm and probable candidate parameters revealed Dst index to be very well correlated with the product of V and Bz.</description>

      <title>Modelling delta Scuti pulsations: A new grid of p, g, and f modes across pre-main-sequence to post-main-sequence evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based photometry from missions such as TESS has revealed that many young delta Scuti stars exhibit regular high-frequency pulsation patterns. These pulsations provide a powerful means of inferring stellar properties, particularly ages, for pre-main-sequence and early main-sequence delta Scuti stars, for which traditional age-dating methods are poorly constrained. Realising this potential requires robust theoretical models that capture the complexities of stellar structure and evolution. We present a comprehensive grid of 30 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE oscillation code, tailored specifically to delta Scuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities, and surface rotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early pre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main-sequence contraction phase. For each model, we compute hundreds of adiabatic pulsation frequencies for degrees l = 0-3, capturing p-modes, g-modes, f-modes, and their interactions through avoided crossings. Our analysis maps the behaviour of asteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation (Delta nu) and the phase offset parameter (epsilon), across age, mass, and rotation. We investigate how these parameters change with evolutionary stage and revisit the scaling relations applicable to delta Scuti stars. This new model grid, which is publicly available, is designed to support the asteroseismology community in interpreting delta Scuti pulsations and in probing the evolution and internal structure of these stars. These improvements over previous model grids will allow for reliable age estimates and stronger constraints on stellar evolution pathways and the timing of planet formation across A- and F-type stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Impact of a binary companion in AGB outflows on CO spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late stage of their evolution, low- to intermediate-mass stars pass through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, characterised by strong mass loss through dust driven winds. High angular resolution observations reveal that these winds harbour strong deviations from spherical symmetry, such as spirals and arcs, believed to be caused by hidden (sub-)stellar companions. Much more often, one observes spectral lines, where the presence of a companion is less clear. We study the impact of a binary companion on low-J CO spectral lines of AGB star outflows. By varying the orbital separation and wind velocity, we aim to find line shapes characteristic of more complex binary-induced morphologies. We generated a grid of nine 3D models of a mass-losing AGB star using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom, with three values for both the outflow velocity and orbital separation. Utilising the radiative transfer code Magritte, we created synthetic spectral lines for the low rotational transitions of CO at different inclinations and position angles. Our simulations show a variety of morphologies, always with a pronounced spiral structure arising in the orbital plane, but with varying shapes in the meridional plane, and different degrees of global flattening. We find that the CO line profiles can deviate strongly from the parabolic or flat-topped profiles expected from spherically symmetric outflows. A variety of line shapes emerge, with two peaks near the terminal velocity, and a central bump near the central velocity being the most pronounced. In specific cases, the spectral lines can appear parabolic, hiding the presence of a binary companion. We find the CO spectral lines can serve as a binary diagnostic. The influence of the companion on the line can however also go easily unnoticed, as the features can be concealed by the beam profile and the noise of the observations.</description>

      <title>Discoveries of fine structures and secondary pulses in coherent radio emission from a magnetic massive star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report auroral radio emission from a magnetic B star HD 142990 using the MeerKAT radio telescope at $900-1670$ MHz. The star is known to produce such emission (observed as periodic radio pulses) via electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME). However, past studies on ECME from this star were confined to observations at specific rotational phase ranges where one expects to see such pulses. We, for the first time, observed the star for its one complete rotation cycle and discovered that the star also produces 'off-pulse' emission, which we term as secondary enhancements. Two such enhancements were observed, one of which is left circularly polarized (LCP) and the other is right circularly polarized (RCP), the latter is confirmed to be persistent. Using simulation, we infer that such pulses are likely related to the large misalignment between the stellar rotation and magnetic dipole axes ($&gt;80^\circ$), leading to the formation of highly complex magnetospheric plasma distribution. In addition, by extracting dynamic spectra for the primary pulses, we discovered prominent fine structures in one of the LCP pulses, with timescales as small as the instrumental time resolution (8 seconds). This is the first time that such structures are seen from a magnetic hot star, and has the potential to reveal detailed information about how the emission is driven, and the nature of the elementary sources of radiation. To pinpoint the origin of these fine structures and their significance, higher time and spectral resolution observations should be conducted in the future.</description>

      <title>Solving Lane-Emden-Type Eigenvalue Problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lane-Emden equation, a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation, plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics and astrophysics, particularly in modeling the structure of stellar interiors. Also referred to as the polytropic differential equation, it describes the behavior of self-gravitating polytropic spheres. In this study, we present a novel approach to the solution of the eigenvalue problem which arises when considering the Lane-Emden equation for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The novelty of this work is that, we not only solve the Lane-Emden equation via PINNS but we also determine the eigenvalue, r, which is the stellar radius. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian optimization in the Optuna framework to identify optimal values for the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, and learning rate for each value of n. The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs achieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors &lt; 0.000806%). While for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below 0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 45 M dwarf stars (with 65 exoplanets) using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$&gt;=0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with orbital periods roughly up to 3 days.</description>

      <title>Siberian radioheliograph image classification using ensemble of CLIP, EfficientNet and CatBoost models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a ground-based radio interferometer in Irkutsk, Russia, designed for high-resolution solar observations in the microwave range. It can observe dynamic solar events with spatial resolutions of 7-30 arcseconds and temporal resolution up to 0.1 seconds.
  Generating solar radio images from the Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) is a multi-step calibration process that corrects instrumental and atmospheric distortions, using redundancy-based calibration with both adjacent and non-adjacent antenna pairs to address phase and amplitude errors in visibility data. The CLEAN algorithm is then applied to deconvolve the point spread function, reduce sidelobes, and enhance the visibility of solar features, resulting in higher quality and more reliable images.
  While the calibration process generally improves image quality, it can sometimes result in noisy or spatially shifted images that are not suitable for scientific use. We developed a deep learning approach for automatic image quality classification. The training dataset was prepared using a zero-shot CLIP model and further validated manually. We evaluated four different models: a fine-tuned EfficientNet, two CatBoost variants using embeddings from CLIP and EfficientNet, and an Ensemble model that combined predictions from all three individual models. The Ensemble model achieved the best performance.
  The SRH daily image classification service has been created and is available online at https://forecasting.iszf.irk.ru/srh along with an API offering IDL and Python examples. Integration of Ensemble model into SRH image generating and calibration workflow can improve image reliability and reduces low-quality entries in SRH data catalog, enhancing solar research outcomes.</description>

      <title>Subgiants in NGC 188 Reveal that Rotationally Induced Mixing Creates the Main Sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Li-Dip" is an unexpected, striking, and highly non-standard anomaly of severe lithium depletion observed in mid-F dwarf stars, which has puzzled astronomers for nearly 40 years. Mechanisms proposed to explain the Li-Dip include effects related to rotation, magnetic fields, diffusion, gravity waves, and mass loss. The critical question became, which, if any, might be realistic? Here we show that mixing due to shear induced by stellar angular momentum loss is the unique mechanism driving the Li depletion. Each mechanism leaves a different signature in the subsurface Li distribution. The deepening surface convection zones of subgiants of NGC 188 evolving out of the Li-Dip dredge up the sub-surface material and thus reveal the signature of the responsible mechanism, rotation. Beryllium and boron data have also favored rotational mixing; however, these elements can be extremely difficult or impossible to observe. Our highly complementary approach provides fresh and very feasible perspectives on using Li to probe poorly understood physical mechanisms acting below the stellar surface, thereby improving fundamental understanding of stellar evolution. Rotational mixing may be the dominant mechanism that depletes Li in a wide range of Solar-type stars, including in the Sun. Possible connections to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Tayler magnetic instability on the surface abundance of boron in massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The surface abundances of massive stars show evidence of internal mixing, while asteroseismic data suggest that efficient angular momentum (AM) transport occurs in stellar interiors. It is of interest to find a consistent physical framework that is able to account for both of these effects simultaneously. Aims: We investigate the impact of the Tayler instability on the surface abundance of boron in massive B-type stars as predicted by rotating stellar models accounting for the advective nature of meridional currents. Methods: We used the Geneva stellar evolution code to compute models of 9, 12, and 15 Msun stars at different rotational velocities and with and without magnetic fields. We compared the surface boron abundances predicted by these models with those of observed B-type stars. Results: We find that models with only hydrodynamic transport processes overestimate the amount of boron depletion for stars with high rotation rates, in disagreement with observational constraints. We show that this excessively high mixing efficiency is a consequence of the high degree of differential rotation predicted by purely hydrodynamic models. We thus conclude that surface abundances of boron indicate that a more efficient AM transport is needed in stellar radiative zones. We then studied the impact of the Tayler instability as a possible physical explanation to this issue. Models including this instability are found to be in good agreement with constraints on the surface boron abundances, the evolutionary state, and the projected rotational velocity of moderately and fast-rotating B-type stars. Finally, we note that at low rotational velocities, models with magnetic fields do not predict sufficient depletion to be consistent with the observations. This could suggest that the current prescriptions for the Tayler instability may overestimate the AM transport in slow-rotating B-type stars.</description>

      <title>Inertial-range Turbulence Anisotropy of the Young Solar Wind from Different Source Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wavevector and variance anisotropies in the inertial range of the young solar wind observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Using the first 19 encounters of PSP measurements, we identify the young solar wind from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach-number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e., the peripheral region inside CHs. We assess the wavevector anisotropy with the 2D and slab turbulence model for the CH wind and the streamer wind, and the nearly incompressible (NI) MHD turbulence model for the LMBL wind where Taylor's hypothesis becomes questionable. Unlike the $\sim80\%$ 2D contribution typically reported at 1 au, our results show that only $26\%$ of the inertial range energy is associated with 2D fluctuations in the CH wind, and this fraction increases to $45\%$ in the streamer wind. As a representation of the LMBL wind, similarly, the oblique sub-Alfv\'enic intervals and the near-subsonic intervals are characterized by the dominance of slab fluctuations. All the results suggest that slab fluctuations are more abundant in the young solar wind below 0.3 au than at 1 au. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the variance anisotropy in the inertial range on proton plasma beta $\beta_p$. The variance anisotropy is the strongest in the LMBL wind with the lowest $\beta_p$, and the weakest in the streamer wind with the highest $\beta_p$. This contrast can be interpreted as the remnant of fluctuations from the coronal sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Reconnection Nanojets in Eruptive and Confined Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations reveal small-scale reconnection-driven plasma ejections, often termed nanojets, triggered by magnetic field interactions at slight misalignment angles. These fast, collimated plasma ejections are $\sim$1.5 Mm long and $\sim$0.5 Mm wide. In this study, we analyze two high-resolution extreme ultraviolet imaging datasets from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, corresponding to an eruptive (M7.6) and a confined (C1.2) flare, to investigate the dynamics of nanoflare ejections and, for the first time, compare their properties in distinct magnetic environments. We identified 59 nanoflare ejections: 44 in the eruptive flare and 15 in the confined flare event. Our analysis reveals that these events form two distinct classes: confined events exhibit lower speeds (41--174 kms$^{-1}$) and lower kinetic energies ($10^{20}$--$10^{22}$ erg), placing them closely in or near the picoflare energy regime, while eruptive events show higher speeds (131--775 kms$^{-1}$) and higher kinetic energies ($10^{22}$--$10^{24}$ erg), falling within the nanoflare regime. Furthermore, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a highly sheared arcade with greater twist and higher magnetic energy density in the eruptive event, compared to the less twisted configuration in the confined event. We infer that this sheared arcade configuration in the eruptive event creates favorable conditions for higher speeds and kinetic energies, unlike the less braided structure in the confined event. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the surrounding magnetic environment in regulating the energetics of nanoflare ejections in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Periodic change of polarity of photospheric magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the study of periodic structures in the magnetic field of the photosphere. The polarity of the Sun's magnetic fields shows cyclicity with periods of 1-3 years, which is possibly due to quasi-biennial variations that are found in various parameters of solar activity, interplanetary space, and in cosmic rays. In this work, variations in weak magnetic fields of the photosphere were investigated, which required the use of special data processing methods. Synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field for the period 1978-2016 (NSO Kitt Peak) were used. To highlight the contribution of weak magnetic fields, the saturation threshold for synoptic maps was set at 5 G. Based on thus transformed synoptic maps, a time-latitude diagram was constructed. For the selected latitude intervals, smoothing, trend removal and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) were performed. In the time-latitude diagram, 6 spatiotemporal regions with distinct cyclic structure were observed during 4 solar cycles (21-24). The periods ranged from 0.5 to 4 years with a maximum at 1.2 years. The amplitude of ripples is significantly higher for those intervals in which the polar field had positive sign. This effect confirms the connection of ripples variations with the polarity of the 22-year magnetic cycle.</description>

      <title>First Robust Detection of Linear Polarization from Metric Solar Emissions: Challenging Established Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric radio observations of the Sun can provide rich information about emission mechanisms and the propagation medium. For the past five decades, solar polarimetric studies at low radio frequencies have almost always assumed the absence of linear polarization. This has been based on the expectations from coronal propagation effects. Here we present the first robust evidence of linear polarization from solar emissions at meter wavelengths using simultaneous measurements with two telescopes of very different designs separated by thousands of kilometers - the Murchison Widefield Array and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Both datasets show consistent linear polarization fractions, confirming this detection. Rapid changes in morphology, as well as the fractional linear polarization at small time and frequency spans, further rule out any possibilities of an instrumental origin. Assuming the absence of linear polarization in solar radio emissions can result in incorrect interpretation of solar observations as well as those of other flare stars, which are often guided by learnings from solar studies. This discovery highlights the need for relaxing this assumption, and is essential for precise estimation of polarization signatures, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the plasma conditions in the Sun and other stars.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions and fundamental astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs represent the most common end stage of stellar evolution and are important for a range of astrophysical questions. The high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capability of the Habitable World Observatory (HWO) offers a unique capability to characterize white dwarfs. In this documents, we focus on two specific science cases for HWO -- white dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions, and fundamental astrophysics. HWO will have the sensitivity to measure a suite of heavy elements, such as S, C, O, Fe, and Si, in a large sample of polluted white dwarfs to constrain the water content and the light elements in the cores of extrasolar planets. HWO can also be used to search for any small variation on the fine structure constant in the presence of strong gravity. Both science cases require a minimum resolving power of 60,000, and a ultraviolet coverage down to at least 900 Angstrom.</description>

      <title>Heat-flux Instabilities of Regularized Kappa Distributed Strahl Electrons Resolved with ALPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluid behavior of the solar wind is affected by the heat flux carried by the suprathermal electron populations, especially the electron strahl (or beam) that propagates along the magnetic field. In turn, the electron strahl cannot be stable, and in the absence of collisions, its properties are regulated mainly by self-generated instabilities. This paper approaches the description of these heat-flux instabilities in a novel manner using regularized Kappa distributions (RKDs) to characterize the electron strahl. RKDs conform to the velocity distributions with suprathermal tails observed in situ, and at the same time allow for consistent macromodeling, based on their singularity-free moments. In contrast, the complexity of RKD models makes the analytical kinetic formalism complicated and still inaccessible, and therefore, here heat-flux instabilities are resolved using the advanced solver ALPS. Two primary types of instabilities emerge depending on plasma conditions: the whistler and firehose heat-flux instabilities. The solver is successfully tested for the first time for such instabilities by comparison with previous results for standard distributions, such as Maxwellian and Kappa. Moreover, the new RKD results show that idealized Maxwellian models can overrate or underestimate the effects of these instabilities, and also show differences from those obtained for the standard Kappa, which, for instance, underestimate the firehose heat-flux growth rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale photometric surveys are revolutionizing astronomy by delivering unprecedented amounts of data. The rich data sets from missions such as the NASA Kepler and TESS satellites, and the upcoming ESA PLATO mission, are a treasure trove for stellar variability, asteroseismology and exoplanet studies. In order to unlock the full scientific potential of these massive data sets, automated data-driven methods are needed. In this review, I illustrate how machine learning is bringing asteroseismology toward an era of automated scientific discovery, covering the full cycle from data cleaning to variability classification and parameter inference, while highlighting the recent advances in representation learning, multimodal datasets and foundation models. This invited review offers a guide to the challenges and opportunities machine learning brings for stellar variability research and how it could help unlock new frontiers in time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: Temperatures of Nine Highly Magnified Stars in a Galaxy at Redshift z = 0.94 and Simulated Stellar Population Dependence on Stellar Metallicity and the Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416. Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24) produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) produce simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for {\alpha}&gt;1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a factor of ~3-12 (&lt;2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)&lt;-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: A Candidate Massive Binary Star System in a Lensed Galaxy at Redshift 0.94</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed mu ~ 1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z = 0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T &gt; 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the projected source-plane size to R &lt; 270 AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperatures and luminosities of each star are stars with initial masses M1 = 22.5+7.1-5.5 Msun and an initial mass ratio very close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of ~50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive one dimensional (1D) analytical solutions for the transport equations of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence developed by Zank et al. [2012], Adhikari et al. [2023], including the Els\"asser energies and the correlation lengths. The solutions are suitable for an arbitrary given background convection speed and Alfv\'en speed profiles but require near equipartition of turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic field energy. These analytical solutions provide a simple tool to investigate the evolution of turbulence and resulting energetic particle diffusion coefficients in various space and astrophysical environments that possess simple geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernova Progenitors and Surviving Companions within the Symbiotic Channel</title>

Abstract: The symbiotic channel of Type Ia supernovae progenitors is crucial for explaining the observed circumstellar material in some Type Ia supernovae. While extensive numerical and observational efforts have been dedicated to exploring the progenitor system, limited emphasis has been placed on studying the surviving companions arising from the symbiotic channel. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the symbiotic systems using {\tt MESA} as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. We conduct 1260 binary stellar evolution simulations, over a wide range of parameters, incorporating the optically thick wind model developed by Hachisu et al., and predict the post-impact evolution of these surviving companions. We classify four types of progenitor systems based on the evolutionary stage of the companion at the onset of the explosion: red giant companions, with or without prior helium flash events, and asymptotic giant branch companions, with or without the thermal pulsing phase. After the SN impact, a blue dwarf star with either a helium or carbon-oxygen core is left behind. However, if a small portion of the envelope ($\gtrsim$ 0.3\%) remains on the core of the surviving companion, the overall post-supernova evolution may remain similar to its pre-explosion state, albeit slightly fainter, making observation a challenging endeavor.</description>

      <title>A mechanism-independent methodology for modeling {\gamma}-ray phaseograms of pulsars in the framework of north-south symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi-LAT observations revealed that each GeV phase-folded light-curve (aka. phaseogram) of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars consists of two pulses (P1 &amp; P2) and a "Bridge" between them. There is clearly a "bump" at the Bridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third pulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's &amp; Dragonfly's bridges relatively resemble a "valley floor". Despite such an apparent difference, it is interesting to investigate whether their bridge emissions are still within the same general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would expect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a hypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\gamma$-ray phaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also intriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our prototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation mechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one circularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler shifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam shapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is reported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative correlation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray polarisation. The softer $\gamma$-ray pulsation of the Geminga pulsar is found to span over its full phase. Prompted by systematic evaluations, we outline some potential improvements for our toy model.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of CO in a warm bubble around accreting protoplanets and its observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a midplane-centered layer in which gas-phase CO molecules freeze-out and their overall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the channel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out layer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting protoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust hydrodynamic simulations, directly linking opacities and optical depths to the redistribution of sub-$\mu$m- and mm-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with accretion luminosity $\sim$$10^{-3}\,L_{\odot}$ was considered as the nominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet, locally increasing the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative transfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a conspicuous CO emission source in channel maps, appearing as a low-intensity optically thick spot located in-between the `dragonfly wings' that trace the foreside and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of the bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopologue, suggesting a very rich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the extended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologues that are optically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap, such as C$^{18}$O. For those, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual in synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially-averaged channel maps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of forming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large dust grains from the circumplanetary environment which becomes unobservable in the sub-mm continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA detections.</description>

      <title>Very Massive Stars with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) are defined as stars with an initial mass in excess of 100 Msun. Because of their short lifetime and the shape of the stellar mass function, they are rare objects. Only about twenty of them are known in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. However VMS are important in several ways. They efficiently spread nucleosynthesis products through their boosted stellar winds, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability supernovae or to form heavy black-holes from direct collapse, and they outshine all other types of stars in the ultraviolet light, thus dominating the integrated light of starbursts. Their presence is indirectly suspected across all redshifts, all the way to cosmic dawn where they may have played a key role in the formation of the first galaxies. Their search and identification is currently hampered by instrumental limitation, especially spatial resolution. An integral field spectrograph working at the diffraction limit of HWO (5mas) and with a spectral resolution of about 2000 would revolutionize the understanding of VMS. We make the case for such an instrument in this contribution.</description>

      <title>Design, Fabrication and Characterization of the Thermal Filter Assembly on the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on-board Aditya- L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) observes the Sun in the near-ultraviolet regime on board the Aditya-L1 satellite, India's dedicated mission to study the Sun. SUIT will image the Sun in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm using 11 science bandpasses with varying spectral bandwidths between 0.1-58 nm. Within this range, the Sun provides huge incoming solar flux to the telescope that also varies by a factor of ~ 20 from the lower end to the upper end of the wavelength band of interest. Thermal Filter Assembly (TFA) is an optical component at the SUIT entrance aperture, directly facing the Sun. The TFA is used to control the heat load entering the telescope cavity and also to reduce the signal reaching the SUIT camera system and the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor, which is limited in full-well capacity and the linear operational regime. The TFA is designed to allow only 0.1-0.45% of the incoming flux to pass within 200-400 nm. The choice of materials for substrate and coating for the filter poses several challenges in terms of contamination, corrosion/ oxidation and durability during the manufacturing process. Additionally, long-term exposure to harsh space environments and the formation of pinholes are other concerns. Direct exposure to the sun leads to a strong temperature gradient along the thickness of the filter. The design and assembly of the TFA are performed to avoid any thermo-elastic stress affecting optical performance. Different levels of qualification tests and the operation of SUIT in orbit for more than 14 months have confirmed the perfect working of the TFA. To the best of our knowledge, the design, development, and testing of such a rejection filter is the first of its kind for space telescopes in the near ultraviolet range.</description>

      <title>The planetary-mass-limit VLT/SINFONI library: Spectral extraction and atmospheric characterization via forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to deepen our understanding of the M-L transition on planetary-mass companions and isolated brown dwarfs, and search for evidence of possible differences between these two populations of objects. To this end, we present a set of 21 VLT/SINFONI K-band observations from five archival programs at a spectral resolution of 4000. We aim to measure atmospheric properties, such as temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, to understand the similarities and differences between objects ranging from M5 to L5 in spectral type. We extracted the spectra of these targets with the TExTRIS code. Subsequently, we model them using ForMoSA, a Bayesian forward modeling tool for spectral analysis, exploring four families of self-consistent atmospheric models: ATMO, BT-Settl, Exo-REM, and Sonora. Here we present the spectra of our targets and the derived parameters from the atmospheric modeling. We observed a drop in effective temperature of more than 500 K as a function of spectral type at the M/L transition, likely related to limitations in the current atmospheric models. In addition, we report carbon-to-oxygen ratio measurements for three companions (2M 0103 AB b, AB Pic b, and CD-35 2722 b), which contribute to the growing list of exoplanets for which this value has been measured. In conclusion, the VLT/SINFONI Library highlights two key points. First, there is a critical need to further investigate the discrepancies among grids of spectra generated by self-consistent models, as these models yield varying results and do not uniformly explore the parameter space. Second, we do not observe apparent discrepancies in the K-band spectra between companions and isolated brown dwarfs, which potentially suggests that these super-Jupiter objects formed through a similar process; however, this warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>The late Miocene $^{10}$Be anomaly and the possibility of a supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The dust and gas temperature in proto-planetary disks play critical roles in determining their chemical evolution and influencing planet formation processes. Aims. We attempted an accurate measurement of the dust and CO temperature profile in the edge-on disk of the Flying Saucer. Methods. We used the unique properties of the Flying Saucer, its edge-on geometry and its fortunate position in front of CO clouds with different brightness temperatures to provide independent constraints on the dust temperature. We compared it with the dust temperature derived using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the CO gas temperature. Results. We find clear evidence for a substantial gas temperature vertical gradient, with a cold (10 K) disk mid-plane and a warmer CO layer where T(r) is 27 K at 100 au, dropping with exponent 0.3. Direct evidence for CO depletion in the mid-plane, below about 1 scale height, is also found. At this height, the gas temperature is 15-20 K, consistent with the expected CO freeze out temperature. The dust disk appears optically thin at 345 GHz, and exhibits moderate settling.</description>

      <title>Fluid approach of current-driven Langmuir waves associated with type III radiation and whistler waves: Relevance to PSP and other solar wind observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical model on the basis of fluid-Maxwell equations for an electron-ion plasma is presented which describes the conversion of current-driven Langmuir waves into type III radiation whereby simultaneously an excitation of whistler waves may occur. In contrast to the classical approach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, the presented mechanism works without any instability and wave coalescence. Rather the electric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency can be triggered by different realisations of the driving current, e.g. by the (uncompensated) net current of the strahl at t=0 in a core-strahl plasma or by given current variations which may represent different situations in space, as shocks, magnetic switch-backs etc.. A linearized system of equations is used to describe the mode coupling occurring at oblique propagation between the mostly electrostatic Langmuir wave and the adjacent electromagnetic left-hand polarized (L) wave. The simplicity of the fluid model allows without great effort the parameters of the current profiles to be varied and thus to simulate a wide range of possible experimental conditions. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, and in particular some of the recent results of the Parker Solar Probe are interpreted in the light of the theoretical model presented. For the case of the uncompensated strahl, the fluid approach is confirmed by fully kinetic PIC simulations. One comparison is shown in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>PIC simulation of current-driven solar type III radiation and whistler waves in an electron core-strahl plasma: Relevance to PSP and other space observations</title>

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that electron current oscillations may generate electromagnetic waves as type III radiation and whistler waves without the involvement of the classical plasma emission via the coalescence of waves. PIC simulation results of an electron-core-strahl plasma without initial current compensation are presented which describe the conversion of current-driven Langmuir oscillations/waves into type III radiation whereby simultaneously whistler waves are excited. In contrast to the classical approach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, any instability is suppressed by selecting a low strahl velocity. Rather electric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency are triggered by the initially non-compensated current of the strahl. The arising electromagnetic fields exhibit amplitude oscillations which are caused by the superposition of the two wave modes of mixed polarisation at the point of mode coupling. This basic mechanism of wave generation and transformation has already been described in earlier papers using simple fluid models. It is also the topic of the companion paper. Besides the fundamental electromagnetic radiation, the second harmonic of nearly the same intensity has been obtained which is an indication for nonlinear currents. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, in particular Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations are analysed in the light of our results. Interpretations of earlier PIC simulations are critically reviewed.</description>

Abstract: Single pulse studies offer vital insights into the emission physics of pulsars, particularly in the case of young, nearby sources where intrinsic variability is often pronounced. PSR~B0656+14, known for its sporadic and sometimes intense pulses, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such behaviour at low radio frequencies. This study aims to characterize the single pulse behaviour of PSR~B0656+14 using low-frequency observations at 110-190 MHz from the Irish LOFAR station. Single-pulse extraction is performed, and individual pulse DMs are estimated to probe pulse-to-pulse dispersion variability. We also perform a wait-time analysis to understand the statistical nature of pulse occurrence, and estimate the spectral index from frequency-resolved flux density measurements. The pulse energy distribution is modelled using a combination of log-normal and power-law components. A total of 41 pulses were detected in a 5-hour observation, allowing a wait-time distribution analysis which is well-modelled by an exponential function, indicative of a Poisson process. Profile stability analysis indicates that a significant number of pulses are required to reach a stable average profile, unusual compared to many other pulsars. The single-pulse spectral index varies significantly from pulse to pulse, with a mean value of $\alpha = -0.5$ and a standard deviation of $\Delta\alpha=1.3$. The pulse energy distribution shows a hybrid behaviour, consistent of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. Our results confirm that PSR~B0656+14 exhibits highly variable, memory-less emission at low frequencies, with characteristics that resemble those seen in some rotating radio transients (RRATs). If such variability proves to be widespread among pulsars, population synthesis models and survey yield predictions would need to incorporate this currently overlooked feature to ensure accuracy.</description>

      <title>The SEDs of very long-period cepheids in the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds, M31 and M33</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33 (classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess.
  The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the literature.
  WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess emission was related to the central objects.
  Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii} Cepheid.
  The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the instability strip.
  For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can significantly change their position in the HRD.</description>

      <title>First detection of Circular Polarization in radio continuum towards a Massive Protostar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on magnetic fields in star-forming systems. While magnetic field estimates of a few kiloGauss (kG) have been obtained near the surface of low-mass protostars, there are no analogous measurements in the immediate vicinity of the surface of massive protostars. We report the measurement of radio continuum circular polarization (CP) towards a massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048 for the first time wielding Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The fractional CP varies between $3-5\%$ across the observed frequency range of $4-6$ GHz. We consider multiple hypotheses for the production of CP and propose (i) gyrosynchrotron emission and (ii) Faraday conversion due to turbulence in the magnetic medium - both driven by mildly relativistic electrons as plausible mechanisms. We estimate, for the first time, a magnetic field $B\gtrsim20-35$ G close to the massive protostar. The Lorentz factor of the low energy electrons is estimated to be in the range $\gamma_{min}\sim5-7$ for gyrosynchrotron emission and $80-100$ for Faraday conversion from our observations. The magnetic field estimate can provide important constraints to the formation models of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nebular-Phase Calculations of Dynamically-Driven Double-Degenerate Double-Detonation Models for Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation model has emerged as a promising progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, the primary white dwarf ignites due to dynamical interaction with a companion white dwarf, which may also undergo a detonation. Consequently, two scenarios exist: one in which the secondary survives and another in which both white dwarfs detonate. In either case, substantial departures from spherical symmetry are imprinted on the ejecta. Here, we compute full non local thermodynamic equilibrium nebular-phase spectra in 1D and 3D to probe the innermost asymmetries. Our simulations reveal that the multidimensional structures significantly alter the overall ionisation balance, width and velocity of features, especially when the secondary detonates. In this scenario, some element distributions may produce orientation-dependent line profiles that can be centrally peaked from some viewing-angles and somewhat flat-topped from others. Comparison to observations reveals that both scenarios produce most observed features from the optical to mid-infrared. However, the current model realisations do not consistently reproduce all line shapes or relative strengths, and yield prominent optical Ar III emission which is inconsistent with the data. When the secondary detonates, including 3D effects, improves the average agreement with observations, however when compared to observations, particularly weak optical Co III emission and the presence of optical O I and near-infrared S I challenge its viability for normal Type Ia supernovae. Thus, our comparisons with normal Type Ia's tentatively favour detonation of only the primary white dwarf, but we stress that more model realisations and mid-infrared observations are needed.</description>

      <title>Strongly polarised radio pulses from a new white-dwarf-hosting long-period transient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-period transients (LPTs) are a new and enigmatic class of objects that produce bright pulsations in the radio, with periods far exceeding those seen in rotationally powered pulsars. The proposed progenitors for LPTs are contested, with white dwarfs or magnetars being likely candidates. Here, we present the discovery of ILT\,J163430+445010, a new LPT detected in a blind search for Stokes\,V transients in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey. Unusual for LPTs, J1634+44 shows pulses that are 100\% circularly polarised, as well as pulses that are 100\% linearly polarised, with the polarisation state changing from pulse to pulse. We detect 19 pulses in total, each with a total polarisation fraction of $\sim100\%$ and a pulse duration of at most 10\,s. The pulses show a periodicity at $841.24808\pm0.00015$\,s, implying a low duty cycle of $0.012$. J1634+44 has a marginally detected counterpart in the ultraviolet GALEX MIS survey and the ultraviolet/optical UNIONS survey, suggesting that it contains a white dwarf with an effective temperature between 15000\,K and 33000\,K. We do not detect J1634+44 with a deep $J$-band exposure with UKIRT at a $3\sigma$ AB magnitude limit of 24.7, ruling out a main-sequence star or ultracool dwarf with a spectral type earlier than M7. The pulses from J1634+44 follow a particular pattern, with two pulses being produced every five periods after a waiting time of two or three periods. This pattern could be a result of spin-orbit coupling in a binary system with a 5:2 or 5:3 resonance, where a companion induces beamed radio emission on the white dwarf. The companion is most likely an ultracool dwarf or another white dwarf, making J1634+44 unique among the currently known sample of LPTs.</description>

      <title>Bounding destruction timescales of minor planets orbiting white dwarfs with the sesquinary catastrophe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical activity attributed to the destruction of minor planets orbiting white dwarfs has now been photometrically monitored in individual systems for up to one decade, long enough to measure significant cessation and re-emergence of transit features. Further, periodicities which hint at the presence of debris orbiting exterior to the white dwarf Roche radius, along with widely varying estimates for debris disc lifetimes (up to Myrs), complicate theories for the formation and dynamical evolution of these systems. Here, we illustrate that minor planets orbiting white dwarfs with periods of $\approx$5-25 hours and longer while completely or partially avoiding tidal disruption satisfy the conditions for the occurrence of the sesquinary catastrophe, a phenomenon that occurs in the solar system when impacts from returning ejecta from a moon are fast enough to be erosional to the point of destruction. We hence find that the region corresponding to $\approx$1-4 white dwarf rubble-pile Roche radii represents a danger zone where the collisional timescale for the sesquinary catastrophe to occur is $\sim 10^2-10^5$ yr, suggesting that debris discs around white dwarfs are in a state of semi-continuous replenishment.</description>

      <title>An Energy Perspective of Core Erosion in Gas Giant Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Juno and Cassini have shown that Jupiter and Saturn likely contain extended gradients of heavy elements. Yet, how these gradients can survive over billions of years remains an open question. Classical convection theories predict rapid mixing and homogenization, which would erase such gradients on timescales far shorter than the planets' ages. To address this, we estimate the energy required to erode both dense and fuzzy cores, and compare it to what the planet can realistically supply. If the entire cooling budget is available to drive mixing, then even a compact core can, in principle, be destroyed. But if mixing is limited to the thermal energy near the core, which is another plausible scenario, the energy falls short. In that case, Jupiter can erode a fuzzy core by up to approximately $10~\mearth$, but a compact one remains intact. Saturn's core is more robust. Even in the fuzzy case, only about $1~\mearth$ is lost, and if the core is compact, erosion is negligible. The outcome depends sensitively on the assumed initial temperature and entropy profiles. Hotter and more superadiabatic interiors are more prone to mixing. We suggest that 3D simulations of convection driven from above, with realistic stratification and enough depth (i.e., many density scale heights) would be of great interest to further constrain the energy budget for core erosion.</description>

      <title>Exploring membership and variability in NGC 7419: An open cluster rich in super giants and Be type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 7419 is a young open cluster notable for hosting five Red Supergiants and a high abundance of Classical Be (CBe) stars. CBe stars are main sequence non-supergiant B-type stars, which exhibit or have exhibited Balmer line emissions in their spectra. We perform a membership analysis using Gaia DR3 data and machine learning techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Random Forest (RF) and determine the cluster's mean distance to be ${3.6^{+1.0}_{-0.6}}$ kpc. We identify 499 Gaia-based members with a mass above $\sim$ 1.2 M$_\odot$, and estimate the cluster's age to be $21.1 ^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ Myr. Using our revised $H\alpha$ excess-based analysis, we find 42 CBe stars containing many known CBe stars, bringing the total number of CBe stars in NGC 7419 to 49 and the fraction of CBe to (B+CBe) members to 12.7%. We investigate the variability of the candidate members from ZTF and NEOWISE data using Standard Deviation, Median Absolute Deviation, and Stetson Index (J), and their periodicity using the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram variability. We find that 66% of CBe stars are variable: 23% show periodic signals, typical of pulsation/rotation, 41% display variability characteristic of disk dynamics or binarity, and 14% exhibit long-term changes, consistent with disk dissipation/formation. We also find that all pulsating CBe stars are early-type, while 50% of stars with long-term variations are early-type, and the other 50% are mid-type. Our results agree with previous findings in the literature and confirm that CBe stars display variability through multiple mechanisms across different timescales.</description>

Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE2020 and Gaia catalogues. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical quadruple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of a likely astrometric binary of two M4 dwarfs and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>

      <title>The H$\alpha$ line as a probe of chromospheric magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the diagnostic potential of the H$\alpha$ line for probing the chromospheric magnetic field using a realistic 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) model. The Stokes profiles of the H$\alpha$ line are synthesized through full 3D radiative transfer under the field-free approximation, alongside the Ca II 8542 {\AA} and Fe I 6173 {\AA} lines for comparison. The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields are inferred using the weak field approximation (WFA) for theH$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines, while the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line is analyzed through Milne-Eddington inversion techniques. The comparison between the inferred LOS magnetic field maps and the magnetic fields in the rMHD model revealed that the H$\alpha$ line core primarily probes the chromospheric magnetic field at log tau_500 = -5.7, which corresponds to higher layers than the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line core, which is most sensitive to conditions at log tau_500 = -5.1. On average, the Stokes V profiles of the H$\alpha$ line core form 500 km higher than those of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line core. The H$\alpha$ polarization signals persist after adding noise, and with noise at the level of 10^-3 Ic, most simulated magnetic structures remain visible. These findings suggest that spectropolarimetric observations of the H$\alpha$ line can provide complementary insights into the stratification of the magnetic field at higher altitudes, especially when recorded simultaneously with widely used chromospheric diagnostics such as the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

      <title>Globular cluster formation from inertial inflows: accreting extremely massive stars as the origin of abundance anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the inertial-inflow model of massive star formation to describe the formation of globular clusters (GCs) in turbulent molecular clouds. A key aspect of this model is that the maximum stellar mass scales linearly with cloud mass, such that extremely massive stars (EMSs, $10^{3-4}\,\msun$) form in massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^5\,\msun$). The total wind mass loss is dominated by accreting EMSs (aEMSs), whose wind mass-loss rates have become comparable to their accretion rates ($\gtrsim10^{-2}\,\msun\,\yr^{-1}$). These winds pollute the intra-cluster medium with hot-hydrogen burning yields during GC formation. We propose a parameterised model for the evolution of the stellar mass function during GC formation ($\sim 1-2\,\myr$), accounting for gas inflow, wind mass loss and mixing of aEMS yields with pristine gas that has initial proto-GC abundances. Low-mass stars ($\lesssim1\,\msun$) form continuously from this mixed gas and their abundances resemble observed abundance trends with GC mass and metallicity, specifically: (i) the helium spread in a typical GC is small ($\Delta Y \simeq 0.01$) and increases with GC mass; (ii) the fraction of polluted stars increases with GC mass and metallicity; (iii) the extent of the Mg-Al anticorrelations is more pronounced in metal-poor and massive GCs. We conclude that GCs formed with a population of EMSs from gas with surface densities $\gtrsim10^3\,\msun\,\pc^{-2}$ and that nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope ({\it JWST}) are dominated by EMS-rich GCs that formed in the earliest phases of galaxy formation. These EMSs may have left behind intermediate-mass black holes with masses above the pair-instability gap ($\gtrsim120\,\msun$) that could be found with ongoing gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration peaks on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around time, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These spatially inhomogeneous, rapid acceleration regimes pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Spin-down Glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, showing that one of the superfluid glitch models is incompatible with PSR J1835$-$1106 due to its insufficient spin-down rate and angular velocity lag. The wind braking scenario offers a viable alternative, consistent with the observed spin-down behavior, glitch amplitude, and post-glitch recovery. High-cadence, high-sensitivity monitoring of similar events is essential to distinguish between internal (superfluid) and external (wind-related) glitch mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Grand Design Spiral Arms in the Compact, Embedded Protoplanetary Disk of Haro 6-13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Volatile Gas in the Giant Impact Disk around the 150-Myr old HD 23514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CO$_2$ gas emission around HD 23514, an F5V star in the $\sim$150 Myr-old Pleiades cluster, hosting one of the rare giant-impact disks with unique mineralogy dominated by silica dust. We show that the dust feature remains stable over several decades, and that the sub-$\mu$m grains, which give rise to the $\sim$9 $\mu$m feature, are co-spatial with the hot CO$_2$ molecules within the sub-au vicinity of the star. Examining the Spitzer spectrum taken 15 years earlier, we show that the CO$_2$ emission was also present at 4.3 $\sigma$ significance. The existence of tiny silica grains and volatile gas requires special conditions to prevent the rapid loss caused by stellar radiation pressure and photodissociation. We explore several pathways explaining the observed properties and suggest that a past giant impact and/or stripping atmospheric event, involving large bodies with volatile content similar to the carbonaceous chondritic material, can simultaneously explain both the silica and volatile emission. Our discovery provides an important context for the amount of volatiles that a newly formed planet or the largest planetesimals could retain during the giant impact phase in the early solar system evolution.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Collisional Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code Fornax. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI (hCFI) modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation, the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group hCFI are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like hCFI. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like hCFI into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by hCFI modes are in general small.</description>
