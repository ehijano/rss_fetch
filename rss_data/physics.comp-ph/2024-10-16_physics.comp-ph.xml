      <title>Fast Plasma Frequency Sweep in Drude-like EM Scatterers via the Reduced-Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to use the Reduced-Basis Method (RBM) as a model order reduction approach to solve Maxwell's equations in electromagnetic (EM) scatterers based on plasma to build a metasurface, taking into account a parameter, namely, the plasma frequency. We build up the reduced-order model in an adaptive fashion following a greedy algorithm. This method enables a fast sweep over a wide range of plasma frequencies, thus providing an efficient way to characterize electromagnetic structures based on Drude-like plasma scatterers. We validate and test the proposed technique on several plasma metasurfaces and compare it with the finite element method (FEM) approach.</description>

      <title>Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order modeling using stable learned differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonintrusive projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) are essential for dynamics prediction in multi-query applications where access to the source of the underlying full order model (FOM) is unavailable; that is, FOM is a black-box. This article proposes a learn-then-project approach for nonintrusive model reduction. In the first step of this approach, high-dimensional stable sparse learned differential operators (S-LDOs) are determined using the generated data. In the second step, the ordinary differential equations, comprising these S-LDOs, are used with suitable dimensionality reduction and low-dimensional subspace projection methods to provide equations for the evolution of reduced states. This approach allows easy integration into the existing intrusive ROM framework to enable nonintrusive model reduction while allowing the use of Petrov-Galerkin projections. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated for Galerkin and LSPG projection-based ROMs through three numerical experiments: 1-D advection equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicate that the proposed nonintrusive ROM strategy provides accurate and stable dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Multiple scales homogenisation of a porous viscoelastic material with rigid inclusions: application to lithium-ion battery electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the mechanical behaviour of the composite materials used in modern lithium-ion battery electrodes. These contain relatively high modulus active particle inclusions within a two-component matrix of liquid electrolyte which penetrates the pore space within a viscoelastic polymer binder. Deformations are driven by a combination of (i) swelling/contraction of the electrode particles in response to lithium insertion/extraction, (ii) swelling of the binder as it absorbs electrolyte, (iii) external loading and (iv) flow of the electrolyte within the pores. We derive the macroscale response of the composite using systematic multiple scales homomgenisation by exploiting the disparity in lengthscales associated with the size of an electrode particle and the electrode as a whole. The resulting effective model accurately replicates the behaviour of the original model (as is demonstrated by a series of relevant case studies) but, crucially, is markedly {simpler and hence} cheaper to solve. This is significant practical value because it facilitates low-cost, realistic computations of the mechanical states of battery electrodes, thereby allowing model-assisted development of battery designs that are better able to withstand the mechanical abuse encountered in practice and ultimately paving the way for longer-lasting batteries.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Unstable Region of the Entropy to the Pattern of the Fisher's Zeros Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01654v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions are one of the most interesting natural phenomena. For finite systems, one of the concerns in the topic is how to classify a specific transition as being of first, second, or even of a higher order, according to the Ehrenfest classification. The partition function provides all the thermodynamic information about the physical systems, and a phase transition can be identified by the complex temperature where it is equal to zero. In addition, the pattern of the zeros on the complex temperature plane can provide evidence of the order of the transition. In this manuscript, we present an analytical and simulational study connecting the microcanonical analysis of the unstable region of the entropy to the canonical partition function zeros. We show that, for the first-order transition, the zeros accumulate uniformly in a vertical line on the complex inverse temperature plane as discussed in previous works. We illustrate our calculation using the $147$ particles Lennard-Jones cluster.</description>

      <title>EPi-cKANs: Elasto-Plasticity Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Using Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are predominantly used to develop data-driven constitutive models for granular materials. They offer a compelling alternative to traditional physics-based constitutive models in predicting nonlinear responses of these materials, e.g., elasto-plasticity, under various loading conditions. To attain the necessary accuracy, MLPs often need to be sufficiently deep or wide, owing to the curse of dimensionality inherent in these problems. To overcome this limitation, we present an elasto-plasticity informed Chebyshev-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EPi-cKAN) in this study. This architecture leverages the benefits of KANs and augmented Chebyshev polynomials, as well as integrates physical principles within both the network structure and the loss function. The primary objective of EPi-cKAN is to provide an accurate and generalizable function approximation for non-linear stress-strain relationships, using fewer parameters compared to standard MLPs. To evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of EPi-cKAN in modeling complex elasto-plastic behavior, we initially compare its performance with other cKAN-based models, which include purely data-driven parallel and serial architectures. Furthermore, to differentiate EPi-cKAN's distinct performance, we also compare it against purely data-driven and physics-informed MLP-based methods. Lastly, we test EPi-cKAN's ability to predict blind strain-controlled paths that extend beyond the training data distribution to gauge its generalization and predictive capabilities. Our findings indicate that, even with limited data and fewer parameters compared to other approaches, EPi-cKAN provides superior accuracy in predicting stress components and demonstrates better generalization when used to predict sand elasto-plastic behavior under blind triaxial axisymmetric strain-controlled loading paths.</description>

      <title>KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD), systems are molecules made up of    atoms, and the aim is to determine their evolution over time.  MD    is based on a numerical resolution algorithm, whose role is to    apply the forces generated by the various components, according to    the equations of Newtonian physics. Molecular Dynamics is    currently mainly used in materials science and molecular biology.  In this document, we limit ourselves to {\it alkanes} which are  non-cyclic carbon-hydrogenated chains. In the basic ``All-atom''  (AA) scale, all the atoms are directly simulated. In the  ``United-atom'' (UA) scale, one considers grains that are composed  of a carbon atom with the hydrogen atoms attached to it. Grains in  the ``Coarse-grained'' (CG) scale are composed of two consecutive UA  grains. In the multi-scale approach, one tries to use as much as  possible the UA and CG scales which can be more efficiently  simulated than the AA scale.  In this document, we mainly put the focus on three topics.  First, we describe an MD system, implemented in the Java  programming language, according to the Synchronous Reactive  Programming approach in which there exists a notion of a global  logical time.  This system is used to simulate molecules and also to  build the potentials functions at the UA and CG scales.  Second, two methods to derive UA and CG potentials from AA  potentials are proposed and analysed. Basically, both methods rely  on strong geometrical links with the AA scale. We use these links  with AA to determine the forms and values of the UA and CG  potentials.  In the first method (called ``inverse-Boltzmann''), one  considers data produced during several AA scale molecule  simulations, and one processes these data using a statistical  approach. In the second method (``minimisation method''), one  applies a constrained-minimisation technique to AA molecules. The  most satisfactory method clearly appears to be the  minimisation-based one.  The UA potentials we have determined have  standard forms: they only differ from AA potentials by parameter  values. On the opposite, CG potentials are non-standard  functions. We show how to implement them with functions defined ``by  cases''.  Finally, we consider ``reconstructions'' which are means to  dynamically change molecule scales during simulations.  In  particular, we consider automatic reconstructions based on the  proximity of molecules.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies over the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For cases, where $\Delta$-ML method might be favored, such as small test set regimes, the MF$\Delta$-ML method is shown to be more efficient than conventional $\Delta$-ML.</description>

      <title>Investigating Data Hierarchies in Multifidelity Machine Learning for Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in machine learning (ML) has made high-accuracy quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible. Of particular interest are multifidelity machine learning (MFML) methods where training data from differing accuracies or fidelities are used. These methods usually employ a fixed scaling factor, $\gamma$, to relate the number of training samples across different fidelities, which reflects the cost and assumed sparsity of the data. This study investigates the impact of modifying $\gamma$ on model efficiency and accuracy for the prediction of vertical excitation energies using the QeMFi benchmark dataset. Further, this work introduces QC compute time informed scaling factors, denoted as $\theta$, that vary based on QC compute times at different fidelities. A novel error metric, error contours of MFML, is proposed to provide a comprehensive view of model error contributions from each fidelity. The results indicate that high model accuracy can be achieved with just 2 training samples at the target fidelity when a larger number of samples from lower fidelities are used. This is further illustrated through a novel concept, the $\Gamma$-curve, which compares model error against the time-cost of generating training samples, demonstrating that multifidelity models can achieve high accuracy while minimizing training data costs.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry-Driven Quantum Gate Design Based on Feynman Path Integral and TPCP Map Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use supersymmetry to enlarge the dimension of the Hilbert space on which the unitary evolution of the state of the quantum fields acts. We discuss how to control the unitary evolution or TPCP maps generated by the quantum evolution of the fields by controlling the vacuum expectations of other fields in the theory. This amounts to breaking supersymmetry using control vacuum expectation values of the other fields. The evolution of the wave functional or TPCP maps obtained by tracing out over other fields is based on the Feynman path integral formula for the fields. By using the methods of quantum stochastic filtering, we estimate the evolving state of the fields from non-demolition noise measurements and then design a family of TPCP maps evolving in time whose outputs match the estimated evolving state. In this way, we are able to simulate the evolution of the state of the quantum noisy fields. Direct matching of the designed TPCP map to output the evolving system state is not possible since there is no way by which we can determine the exact evolving state, we can only estimate it using non-demolition measurements. The family of designed TPCP maps can be based on using a simulated master equation with unknown parameters incorporated into the Hamiltonian and the other Lindblad operators, chosen so as to match the state outputted by the quantum filter.</description>

      <title>Fully-discrete provably Lyapunov consistent discretizations for convection-diffusion-reaction PDE systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection-diffusion-reaction equations are a class of second-order partial differential equations widely used to model phenomena involving the change of concentration/population of one or more substances/species distributed in space. Understanding and preserving their stability properties in numerical simulation is crucial for accurate predictions, system analysis, and decision-making. This work presents a comprehensive framework for constructing fully discrete Lyapunov-consistent discretizations of any order for convection-diffusion-reaction models. We introduce a systematic methodology for constructing discretizations that mimic the stability analysis of the continuous model using Lyapunov's direct method. The spatial algorithms are based on collocated discontinuous Galerkin methods with the summation-by-parts property and the simultaneous approximation terms approach for imposing interface coupling and boundary conditions. Relaxation Runge-Kutta schemes are used to integrate in time and achieve fully discrete Lyapunov consistency. To verify the properties of the new schemes, we numerically solve a system of convection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations governing the dynamic evolution of monomer and dimer concentrations during the dimerization process. Numerical results demonstrated the accuracy and consistency of the proposed discretizations. The new framework can enable further advancements in the analysis, control, and understanding of general convection-diffusion-reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Partition function zeros of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane (Fisher zeros) and in the complex external field plane (Lee-Yang zeros) of a frustrated Ising model with competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1 &gt; 0$) and next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2 &lt; 0$) interactions on the honeycomb lattice. We consider the finite-size scaling (FSS) of the leading Fisher and Lee-Yang zeros as determined from a cumulant method and compare it to a traditional scaling analysis based on the logarithmic derivative of the magnetization $\partial \ln \langle |M| \rangle /\partial\beta$ and the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$. While for this model both FSS approaches are subject to strong corrections to scaling induced by the frustration, their behavior is rather different, in particular as the ratio $\mathcal{R} = J_2/J_1$ is varied. As a consequence, an analysis of the scaling of partition function zeros turns out to be a useful complement to a more traditional FSS analysis. For the cumulant method, we also study the convergence as a function of cumulant order, providing suggestions for practical implementations. The scaling of the zeros convincingly shows that the system remains in the Ising universality class for $\mathcal{R}$ as low as $-0.22$, where results from traditional FSS using the same simulation data are less conclusive. The approach hence provides a valuable additional tool for mapping out the phase diagram of models afflicted by strong corrections to scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models must simulate hundreds of future scenarios for hundreds of years at coarse resolutions, and a handful of high-resolution decadal simulations to resolve localized extreme events. Using Oceananigans.jl, written from scratch in Julia, we report several achievements: First, a global ocean simulation with breakthrough horizontal resolution -- 488m -- reaching 15 simulated days per day (0.04 simulated years per day; SYPD). Second, Oceananigans simulates the global ocean at 488m with breakthrough memory efficiency on just 768 Nvidia A100 GPUs, a fraction of the resources available on current and upcoming exascale supercomputers. Third, and arguably most significant for climate modeling, Oceananigans achieves breakthrough energy efficiency reaching 0.95 SYPD at 1.7 km on 576 A100s and 9.9 SYPD at 10 km on 68 A100s -- the latter representing the highest horizontal resolutions employed by current IPCC-class ocean models. Routine climate simulations with 10 km ocean components are within reach.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Frequency Sampling for Data-driven MOR Applied to Antenna Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, which are essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.</description>

      <title>Phoebus: Performance Portable GRRMHD for Relativistic Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the open source code PHOEBUS (phifty one ergs blows up a star) for astrophysical general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. PHOEBUS is designed for, but not limited to, high energy astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, black-hole accretion disks, and similar phenomena. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are modeled in the Valencia formulation with conservative finite volume methods. Neutrino radiation transport is included with Monte Carlo and moment methods. PHOEBUS is built on the PARTHENON (Grete et al. 2022) performance portable adaptive mesh refinement framework, uses a GPU first development strategy, and is capable of modeling a large dynamic range in space and time. PHOEBUS utilizes KOKKOS for on-node parallelism and supports both CPU and GPU architectures. We describe the physical model employed in PHOEBUS, the numerical methods used, and demonstrate a suite of test problems to showcase its abilities. We demonstrate weak scaling to over 500 H100 GPUs.</description>
