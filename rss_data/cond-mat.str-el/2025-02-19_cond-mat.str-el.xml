      <title>Canted magnetism and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization in metallic states of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model near quarter filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment has examined ultracold, fermionic, spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms in the Lieb lattice at different Hubbard repulsion $U$ and filling fractions $\nu$ (Lebrat et al. arXiv:2404.17555). At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian phases from the condensation of Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed fractional quantum Hall (FQH) plateaus follow a recurring hierarchical structure that allows an understanding of complex states based on simpler ones. Condensing the elementary quasiparticles of an Abelian FQH state results in a new Abelian phase at a different filling factor, and this process can be iterated \textit{ad infinitum}. We show that condensing clusters of the same quasiparticles into an Abelian state can instead realize non-Abelian FQH states. In particular, condensing quasiparticle pairs in the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ Laughlin state yields the anti-Pfaffian phase at half-filling. We moreover show that the successive condensation of Laughlin quasiparticles produces quantum Hall states whose fillings coincide with the most prominent plateaus in the first excited Landau level of GaAs. More generally, such condensation can realize any non-Abelian FQH state that admits a parton representation. This surprising result is supported by an exact analysis of explicit wavefunctions, field theory arguments, conformal-field theory constructions of trial states, and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Nature of the ferromagnet-paramagnet transition in Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron scattering, magnetometry, and muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements were performed to investigate the magnetic order and spin dynamics across the ferromagnet-to-paramagnet transition in the hole-doped Mott insulator Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$. We find that the transition proceeds through a volume-wise phase separation into ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions. Spin fluctuations with a characteristic timescale of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu$s, as detected via $\mu$SR, are observed to appear at Ca concentrations $x \geq 0.10$. The magnetic phase separation, accompanied by a modest dynamic response, represents a novel behavior in Mott systems near the loss of magnetic order. It is linked to a previously observed insulator-metal transition and the associated electronic phase separation into hole-poor Mott insulating and hole-rich metallic phases for $0 &lt; x &lt; 0.50$. In particular, the $x$-dependence of the paramagnetic volume fraction strongly correlates with that of the volume fraction of the hole-rich metallic phase. The spin-wave spectra reveal a doping-induced crossover from isotropic to two-dimensional anisotropic exchange interactions, reflecting substantial changes in the orbital state with increasing Ca content.</description>

      <title>Analytical Diagonalization of Fermi Gas-like Hamiltonians using the Sommerfeld-Watson Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sommerfeld-Watson transformation is a powerful mathematical technique widely used in physics to simplify summations over discrete quantum numbers by converting them into contour integrals in the complex plane. This method has applications in scattering theory, high-energy physics, quantum field theory, and electrostatics. A lesser-known but significant use is in the analytical diagonalization of specific Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, such as the Fermi gas Hamiltonian and the single-impurity Anderson model with vanishing Coulomb repulsion. These models are used to describe important phenomena like conductance in metals, x-ray photoemission, and aspects of the Kondo problem. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the Sommerfeld-Watson transformation and its application in diagonalization procedures for these models, using modern notation to enhance clarity for new students. The analytical results were validated against the numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement. Furthermore, we extend the presented method to a more generalized non-interacting single-impurity Anderson model with variable couplings and arbitrary band dispersion. The procedure presented here successfully achieved the analytical diagonalization of this more complex model, providing a unified solution that encompasses simpler cases. To our knowledge, this general solution has not been previously reported.</description>

      <title>Non-ergodic Phase Transition in the Global Hysteresis of the Frustrated Magnet DyRu2Si2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called "global hysteresis (GH)", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process are skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state. In this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured magnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the phases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a result of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase III, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the phase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where the relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled condition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled condition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the non-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local minima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the III-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random glassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered magnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly nontrivial. Our findings open the possibility of observing non-ergodic states in frustrated magnets with regular long-range orders.</description>

      <title>Disordered ground state in the 3D face-centred frustrated spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ system MnSn(OH)$_\text{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in face-centred cubic (fcc) magnetic sublattices remains underexplored but holds considerable potential for exotic magnetic behaviour. Here we report on the crystal structure, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the $A$-site-vacant double hydroxide perovskite MnSn(OH)$_6$. Despite dominant antiferromagnetic interactions among Mn$^{2+}$ moments, evidenced by a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, the lack of a sharp thermodynamic transition down to 350$\,$mK implies the absence of long-range magnetic order. However, a broad hump in the specific heat at 1.6$\,$K suggests short-range correlations. Neutron diffraction at low temperatures confirms the presence of three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic correlations, manifested as diffuse magnetic scattering with a correlation length $\xi = 24.66\,${\AA} and magnetic propagation vectors $\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2})$ and $(0\,0.625\,0)$ at 20$\,$mK.</description>

      <title>Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly addressing these questions in time-dependent single-particle spectral functions. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS), we find for a chain of interacting spinless fermions that high-frequency driving leads to long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum, accompanied by in-gap modes related to mobile domain walls. Conversely, in the low-frequency regime and in the presence of noise, heating dominates, resulting in a significant loss of quantum coherence. This is further elucidated by the behaviour of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics of a quantum spin coupled to a topological edge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle, where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.</description>

      <title>Bipolaron dynamics in the one-dimensional SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing bipolaron binding, and understanding how it depends on electron-phonon interaction, is crucial to unraveling the nature of emergent many-body states in strongly interacting electron-phonon systems. So far, most studies of bipolarons have been limited to the Holstein model, in which the coupling constant is momentum-independent. The paradigmatic example of momentum-dependent electron-phonon interaction comes from the system in which phonon distortions modify electron hopping, the SSH model. Already individual polarons in the SSH model are richer than the Holstein model counterparts, and feature a phase transition into the finite momentum ground state with increasing electron-phonon interaction. In this paper, we use a variational approach to study bipolarons in the one-dimensional SSH model and discuss their ground state, dispersion, and excitation spectra. We explore the full parameter range of the system, including the adiabatic regime of slow phonons, which was inaccessible to previous theoretical studies. In agreement with earlier studies, we find that in the anti-adiabatic strongly interacting regime, bipolarons have low effective mass. By contrast, in the adiabatic case, we find that increasing electron-phonon interactions results in an exponential increase of the bipolaron mass. We establish the existence of multiple branches of bound excited states of SSH bipolaron and discuss the signatures of these bound states in dynamics. We show that in the anti-adiabatic regime, response functions obey a parity selection rule, that imposes symmetry constraints on the excitation spectra and provides a clear signature of SSH bipolarons.</description>

      <title>Stripe-like correlations in the cuprates from oxygen NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of planar oxygen, with its family independent phenomenology, is ideally suited to probe the nature of the quantum matter of superconducting cuprates. Here, with new experiments on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, in particular also at high doping levels, we report on short-range stripe-like correlations between local charge and spin. Their amplitudes at room temperature are nearly independent of doping up to at least $x=0.30$, only their relative phase slips near $x=1/4$. Comparisons show the correlations to be generic to the cuprates. Despite the atomic scale length, the variations still resemble the average spin and charge relation, which is not expected from the otherwise simple, apparently metallic behavior, even far into the overdoped regime. Perhaps the phase slip is at the heart of a quantum critical point that demands pseudogap behavior towards lower doping levels in an otherwise strange metal.</description>

      <title>Spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like spin textures with a nontrivial topology, which ensures their stability even at the nanometer scale. This feature establishes skyrmions as promising information carriers for novel magnetic storage and processing devices, e.g., racetrack memories. However, their fate in various magnetic backgrounds is poorly understood. Here, we show that spiral multiferroics, some of the simplest noncollinear magnets, host bimerons -- skyrmionic textures formed by vortex-antivortex pairs. The bimeron carries magnetic and ferroelectric dipole moments that remarkably depend on its position relative to the spiral background. This property enables precise positioning of the bimeron using a slowly rotating magnetic field, as a $2\pi$ field rotation shifts the bimeron by one spiral period. We also investigate the non-adiabatic regime that occurs when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical threshold. The results establish a new paradigm in which the background endows topological spin textures with unique functionalities, highlighting spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack.</description>

      <title>Extracting the topological spins from bulk multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a 2+1d topologically ordered phase using measurements on the ground-state wavefunction. For non-chiral topological order, we describe a series of bulk multipartite entanglement measures that extract the invariants $\sum_a d_a^2 \theta_a^r$ for any $r \geq 2$, where $d_a$ and $\theta_a$ are the quantum dimension and topological spin of an anyon $a$, respectively. These invariants are obtained as expectation values of permutation operators between $2r$ replicas of the wavefunction, applying different permutations on four distinct regions of the plane. Our proposed measures provide a refined tool for distinguishing topological phases, capturing information beyond conventional entanglement measures such as the topological entanglement entropy. We argue that any operator capable of extracting the above invariants must act on at least $2r$ replicas, making our procedure optimal in terms of the required number of replicas. We discuss the generalization of our results to chiral states.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric photocurrents of quasiparticles in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Normal State and Pressure-driven Reentrant Superconductivity in the Heavy $d$-electron Superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity beyond the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) framework often emerges out of a normal state that is accompanied by exotic magnetism and thereby displays many exceptional transport and thermodynamic properties. Here we report that the normal state of the heavy $d$-electron superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ is characterized by a weak \textit{ferromagnetism} that persists up to room temperature. We show that the broad hump in its resistivity likely results from the Kondo interaction of the conduction electrons with this novel magnetism. By applying pressure, superconductivity is fully suppressed first. In the high-pressure regime, however, we observe a second dome of superconductivity with its maximum $T_c$ greater than the ambient pressure value, highlighting the possible \textit{unconventional} superconductivity in this heavy $d$-electron sulfide.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced non-unitary criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum impurities give rise to rich physical phenomena, with some exhibiting critical behavior described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the low-energy limit. In parallel, party-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric non-Hermitian systems host exceptional points (EPs) at criticality, leading to exotic features governed by non-unitary CFTs. Here, we establish a connection between non-Hermitian impurities and CFTs by demonstrating that the critical properties of a (1+1)-dimensional free-fermion chain with central charge $c=1$ can be drastically altered by the presence of a local non-Hermitian impurity. Through a systematic analysis of entanglement/R\'enyi entropy, the finite-size scaling of the many-body spectrum, and fidelity susceptibility, we identify that this impurity-induced non-Hermitian criticality is characterized by a non-unitary CFT with central charge $c=-2$. Furthermore, we find that these non-unitary critical properties exhibit strong sensitivity to boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric and General Relativistic Techniques for Non-relativistic Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores the application of differential geometric and general relativistic techniques to deepen our understanding of quantum mechanical systems. We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to uncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the context of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies for a variety of accelerated trajectories via first-order perturbation theory. For harmonic motion of the atom in a vacuum, we derive transition rates with potential experimental realizations. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting fermions in a background magnetic field generated by a Wu-Yang monopole. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem constrains the degeneracy of the ground state, and the fractional quantum Hall effect is studied using the composite fermion model, where Dirac strings associated with the monopole field supply the statistical gauge field vortices. A unique, gapped ground state emerges, yielding fractions of the form $\nu = \frac{1}{2k+1}$ for large particle numbers. Finally, we examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk fermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background (with a U(1) gauge field), dual to a boundary fermionic operator. Spherical and planar event horizon geometries are discussed, with the temperature of the RN black hole identified with that of the dual system on the boundary. By numerically solving for the spectral functions of the dual theory, for a spherical event horizon at zero temperature, we identify a shift in the Fermi surface from that which arises in the planar case. Preliminary evidence of a phase transition emerges upon examining these spectral functions, again for the spherical horizon, at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Hidden Wave Function of Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Flat Band as a Landau Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.02915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the chirally symmetric continuum model (CS-CM) of the twisted bilayer graphene. The equation on a flat band could be interpreted as a Dirac equation on a torus in the external non-abelian magnetic field. We prove that the existence of the flat band implies that the wave-function has a zero and vice verse. We found a hidden solution in the CS-CM model that has a pole instead of a zero. Our main result is that in the basis of the flat band and hidden wave functions the flat band could be interpreted as Landau level in the external magnetic field. From that interpretation we show the existence of extra flat bands in the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) provides numerically exact solutions for strongly correlated fermionic systems but faces significant computational challenges with increasing system size. While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum many-body problems scales exponentially with the size of the system, rendering any finite size scaling analysis a formidable challenge. This is particularly true for methods based on the full representation of the wave function, where one simply accepts the enormous Hilbert space dimensions and performs linear algebra operations, e.g., for finding the ground state of the Hamiltonian. If the system satisfies an underlying symmetry where an operator with degenerate spectrum commutes with the Hamiltonian, it can be block-diagonalized, thus reducing the complexity at the expense of additional bookkeeping. At the most basic level, required for Krylov space techniques (like the Lanczos algorithm) it is necessary to implement a matrix-vector product of a block of the Hamiltonian with arbitrary block-wavefunctions, potentially without holding the Hamiltonian block in memory. An efficient implementation of this operation requires the calculation of the position of an arbitrary basis vector in the canonical ordering of the basis of the block. We present here an elegant and powerful, multi-dimensional approach to this problem for the $U(1)$ symmetry appearing in problems with particle number conservation. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm uses multiple subsystems and hence generalizes previous approaches to make them scalable. In addition to the theoretical presentation of our algorithm, we provide DanceQ, a flexible and modern - header only - C++20 implementation to manipulate, enumerate, and map to its index any basis state in a given particle number sector as open source software under https://DanceQ.gitlab.io/danceq.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>Role of non-magnetic spacers in the magnetic interactions of antiferromagnetic topological insulators MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ belongs to a family of antiferromagnetic topological insulators. It forms a natural heterostructure of magnetic (septuple) and non-magnetic (quintuple) topological blocks. Here, we explore the magnetism and magnetic interactions in this compound using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that the interlayer magnetic coupling is much weaker in MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ as compared to MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ due to the insertion of non-magnetic quintuple layers in the former. However, other key magnetic energy scales residing within a single septuple block, the single-ion anisotropy and long-range intralayer exchanges, are essentially the same. This identifies a transferable set of magnetic interactions applicable to the extended family of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as the R\'enyi index $n \to 1$ is often believed to yield the von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, earlier findings indicate that this process exhibits a singularity for the colored Motzkin spin chain problem, leading to different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. Our analytical and numerical calculations confirm this transition, which can be explained by the exponentially increasing density of states in the entanglement spectrum that we extract numerically. Disorder operators are further employed under various symmetries to study such a system. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the scaling of the disorder operators also follows $\log{l}$ as the leading behavior, matching that of the R\'enyi entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant shared by both the R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators. This universal constant could potentially help capture the underlying constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions -- topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles -- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Unprecedentedly large gap in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ with the highest $T_c$ at ambient pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cuprate superconductors, the highest $T_c$ is possessed by the HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) system at ambient pressure, but the reason remains elusive. Here we report the scanning tunneling measurements on the Hg-1223 single crystals with $T_c$ = 134 K. The observed gaps determined from the tunneling spectra (STS) can be categorized into two groups: the smaller gap $\Delta_1$ ranges from about 45 to 70 meV, while the larger gap $\Delta_2$ from about 65 to 98 meV. The STS was measured up to 200 K and the larger gap can persist well above $T_c$, indicating a pseudogap feature which may reflect the strong pairing energy in the inner layer. Interestingly, an extremely strong particle-hole asymmetry is observed in associating with a very robust coherence-like peak at the bias of the larger gap in the hole branch of the Bogoliubov dispersion. We argue that the observed asymmetry results may be from the interplay of a flat band (van Hove singularity) in the electronic spectrum and the large gap in the underdoped (inner) layer. A theoretical approach based on a trilayer model with an interlayer coupling can give a reasonable explanation. Our results provide deep insight into understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pressure-enhanced spin-density-wave transition in double-layer nickelate $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a signature of high-temperature superconductivity above the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) was reported for $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$ under pressure. This finding immediately stimulated intense interest in the possible mechanism of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity in double-layer nickelates. Notably, the pressure-dependent phase diagram inferred from transport measurements indicates that the superconductivity under high pressure emerges from the suppression of density-wave-like order at ambient pressure, which is similar to high-temperature superconductors. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of $^{139}La$ nuclei was performed to study the density-wave-like transition in a single crystal of $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$. At high temperatures, two sets of sharp $^{139}La$ NMR peaks are clearly distinguishable from a broad background signals, which are ascribed to La(1) sites from two bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper phases with different oxygen vacancy ${\delta}$. As the temperature decreases, the temperature-dependent $^{139}La$ NMR spectra and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $(1/T_{1}$) for both La(1) sites provide evidence of spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering below the transition temperature ($T_{SDW}$), which is ~ 150 K. The anisotropic splitting in the NMR spectra suggests the formation of a possible double spin stripe with magnetic moments aligned along the c-axis. Furthermore, we studied the pressure-dependent SDW transition up to ~ 2.7 GPa. Surprisingly, the $T_{SDW}$ inferred from NMR measurements of both La(1) sites increases with increasing pressure, which is opposite to the results from previous transport measurements under pressure and suggests an intriguing phase diagram between superconductivity and SDW. All these results will be helpful for building a connection between superconductivity and magnetic interactions in double-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatics, Pentagon Equations, and Hexagon Equations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>

Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4 (i.e., 3+1) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We discover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions and any violations indicate a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and the study of non-invertible symmetries and symmetry topological field theories in higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze thermal correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model away from the maximally chaotic limit. Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole dual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of quasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then numerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the double cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure which is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We present a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces some aspects of this structure.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative Triples for Transcorrelated Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for the coupled cluster ansatz including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-Hermitian. Since the conventional coupled cluster equations are solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with a code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster implementation up to quadruple excitations.</description>

      <title>Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase, though the exact nature of this connection has yet to be elucidated. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</description>
