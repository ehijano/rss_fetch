      <title>The left row rank of quaternion unit gain graphs in terms of girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi=(G,U(\mathbb{Q}),\varphi)$ be a quaternion unit gain graph (or $U(\mathbb{Q})$-gain graph). The adjacency matrix of $\Phi$ is denoted by $A(\Phi)$ and the left row rank of $\Phi$ is denoted by $r(\Phi)$. If $\Phi$ has at least one cycle, then the length of the shortest cycle in $\Phi$ is the girth of $\Phi$, denoted by $g$. In this paper, we prove that $r(\Phi)\geq g-2$ for $\Phi$. Moreover, we characterize $U(\mathbb{Q})$-gain graphs satisfy $r(\Phi)=g-i$ ($i=0,1,2$) and all quaternion unit gain graphs with rank 2. The results will generalize the corresponding results of simple graphs (Zhou et al. Linear Algebra Appl. (2021), Duan et al. Linear Algebra Appl. (2024) and Duan, Discrete Math. (2024)), signed graphs (Wu et al. Linear Algebra Appl. (2022)), and complex unit gain graphs (Khan, Linear Algebra Appl. (2024)).</description>

      <title>Maximal number of mixed Nash equilibria in generic games where each player has two pure strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of Nash equilibria of the mixed extension of a generic finite game in normal form is finite and odd. This raises the question how large the number can be, depending on the number of players and the numbers of their pure strategies. Here we present a lower bound for the maximal possible number in the case of m-player games where each player has two pure strategies. It is surprisingly close to a known upper bound.</description>

      <title>A Modular Inductive Proof of the Chen-Raspaud Conjecture via Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conjectured by Chen and Raspaud that for each integer $k \ge 2$, any graph $G$ with \[ \mathrm{mad}(G) &lt; \frac{2k+1}{k} \quad\text{and}\quad \mathrm{odd\text{-}girth}(G) \ge 2k+1 \] admits a homomorphism into the Kneser graph $K(2k+1,k)$. The base cases $k=2$ and $k=3$ are known from earlier work. A modular inductive proof is provided here, in which graphs at level $k+1$ are classified into four structural classes and are shown to admit no minimal counterexamples by means of forbidden configuration elimination, a discharging argument, path-collapsing techniques, and a combinatorial embedding of smaller Kneser graphs into larger ones. This argument completes the induction for all $k \ge 2$, thus settling the Chen-Raspaud conjecture in full generality.</description>

      <title>Runs in Paperfolding Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paperfolding sequences form an uncountable class of infinite sequences over the alphabet $\{ -1, 1 \}$ that describe the sequence of folds arising from iterated folding of a piece of paper, followed by unfolding. In this note we observe that the sequence of run lengths in such a sequence, as well as the starting and ending positions of the $n$'th run, is $2$-synchronized and hence computable by a finite automaton. As a specific consequence, we obtain the recent results of Bunder, Bates, and Arnold, in much more generality, via a different approach. We also prove results about the critical exponent and subword complexity of these run-length sequences.</description>

      <title>Uniquely $C_{4}^{+}$-saturated graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is uniquely $H$-saturated if it contains no copy of a graph $H$ as a subgraph, but adding any new edge into $G$ creates exactly one copy of $H$. Let $C_{4}^{+}$ be the diamond graph consisting of a $4$-cycle $C_{4}$ with one chord and $C_{3}^{*}$ be the graph consisting of a triangle with a pendant edge. In this paper we prove that a nontrivial uniquely $C_{4}^{+}$-saturated graph $G$ has girth $3$ or $4$. Further, $G$ has girth $4$ if and only if it is a strongly regular graph with special parameters. For $n&gt;18k^{2}-24k+10$ with $k\geq2$, there are no uniquely $C_{4}^{+}$-saturated graphs on $n$ vertices with $k$ triangles. In particular, $C_{3}^{*}$ is the only nontrivial uniquely $C_{4}^{+}$-saturated graph with one triangle, and there are no uniquely $C_{4}^{+}$-saturated graphs with two, three or four triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aougab and Gaster [Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 174 (2023), 569--584] proved that any set of simple closed curves on the torus, where any two are non-homotopic and intersect at most $k$ times, has a maximum size of $k+O(\sqrt{k}\log k)$. We prove the maximum size of such a set is at most $k+O(1)$ and determine the exact maximum size for all sufficiently large $k$. In particular, we show that the maximum does not exceed $k+4$ when $k$ is large.</description>

      <title>Robinson-Schensted shapes arising from cycle decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the symmetric group $S_n$, each element $\sigma$ has an associated cycle type $\alpha$, a partition of $n$ that identifies the conjugacy class of $\sigma$. The Robinson-Schensted (RS) correspondence links each $\sigma$ to another partition $\lambda$ of $n$, representing the shape of the pair of Young tableaux produced by applying the RS row-insertion algorithm to $\sigma$. Surprisingly, the relationship between these two partitions, namely the cycle type $\alpha$ and the RS shape $\lambda$, has only recently become a subject of study. In this work, we explicitly describe the set of RS shapes $\lambda$ that can arise from elements of each cycle type $\alpha$ in cases where $\alpha$ consists of two cycles. To do this, we introduce the notion of an $\alpha$-coloring, where one colors the entries in a certain tableau of shape $\lambda$, in such a way as to construct a permutation $\sigma$ with cycle type $\alpha$ and RS shape $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>On the occupancy fraction of the antiferromagnetic Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum and minimum occupancy fraction of the antiferromagnetic Ising model in regular graphs. The minimizing problem is known to determine a computational threshold in the complexity of approximately sampling from the Ising model at a given magnetization, and our results determine this threshold for nearly the entire relevant parameter range in the case $\Delta=3$. A small part of the parameter range lies outside the reach of our methods, and it seems challenging to extend our techniques to larger $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Rational symmetric functions from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex model in the quadrant, we introduce two families of rational multivariate functions $F_S$ and $G_S$; these are in direct analogy with functions introduced by Borodin in the context of the higher-spin 6-vertex model in the quadrant.
  We prove that $F_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$ and $G_S(y_1,\dots,y_M;z)$ are symmetric functions in their alphabets $(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ and $(y_1,\dots,y_M)$, and pair together to yield a Cauchy identity. Both properties are consequences of the Yang-Baxter equation of the model.
  We show that, in an appropriate limit of the spectral parameters $z$, $F_S$ tends to a stable symmetric function denoted $H_S$. This leads to a simplified version of the Cauchy identity with a fully factorized kernel, and suggests self-duality of the functions $H_S$.
  We obtain a symmetrization formula for the function $F_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$, which exhibits its symmetry in $(x_1,\dots,x_N)$. In contrast to the 6-vertex model, where $F^{6{\rm V}}_S(x_1,\dots,x_N;z)$ is cast as a sum over the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_N$, the symmetrization formula in the 19-vertex model is over a larger set of objects that we define; we call these objects 2-permutations.
  As a byproduct of the proof of our symmetrization formula, we obtain explicit formulas for the monodromy matrix elements of the 19-vertex model in a basis that renders them totally spatially symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tur{\'a}n inequalities and the Laguerre inequalities are closely related to the Laguerre-P\'{o}lya class and the Riemann hypothesis. These inequalities have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a method to determine a positive integer $N$ such that the sequences $\{\sqrt[n]{a_n}/n!\}_{n \ge N}$ and $\{\sqrt[n+1]{a_{n+1}}/(\sqrt[n]{a_n} n!)\}_{n \ge N}$ satisfy the higher order Tur{\'a}n inequalities and the Laguerre inequalities of order two for a P-recursive sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \ge 1}$.</description>

      <title>Powers of Hamilton cycles in oriented and directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P\'osa--Seymour conjecture determines the minimum degree threshold for forcing the $k$th power of a Hamilton cycle in a graph. After numerous partial results, Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi proved the conjecture for sufficiently large graphs. In this paper we focus on the analogous problem for digraphs and for oriented graphs. We asymptotically determine the minimum total degree threshold for forcing the square of a Hamilton cycle in a digraph. We also give a conjecture on the corresponding threshold for $k$th powers of a Hamilton cycle more generally. For oriented graphs, we provide a minimum semi-degree condition that forces the $k$th power of a Hamilton cycle; although this minimum semi-degree condition is not tight, it does provide the correct order of magnitude of the threshold. Tur\'an-type problems for oriented graphs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Schur-hooks and Bernoulli number recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an identity relating families of Schur and power sum symmetric functions, this may be thought of as encoding representation-theoretic properties according to how the $p$-to-$s$ transition matrices provide the irreducible character tables for symmetric groups. The case of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for cycles provides that $p_{n} = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} (-1)^i s_{(n-i, 1^{i})}$, and, since the power sum generator $p_{n}$ reduces to $\zeta(2n)$ for the Riemann zeta function $\zeta$ and for specialized values of the indeterminates involved in the inverse limit construction of the algebra of symmetric functions, this motivates both combinatorial and number-theoretic applications related to the given case of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. In this direction, since every Schur-hook admits an expansion in terms of twofold products of elementary and complete homogeneous generators, we exploit this property for the same specialization that allows us to express $p_{n}$ with the Bernoulli number $B_{2n}$, using remarkable results due to Hoffman on multiple harmonic series. This motivates our bijective approach, through the use of sign-reversing involutions, toward the determination of identities that relate Schur-hooks and power sum symmetric functions and that we apply to obtain a new recurrence for Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>Computing the k-binomial complexity of generalized Thue--Morse words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two finite words are k-binomially equivalent if each subword (i.e., subsequence) of length at most k occurs the same number of times in both words. The k-binomial complexity of an infinite word is a function that maps the integer $n\geq 0$ to the number of k-binomial equivalence classes represented by its factors of length n. The Thue--Morse (TM) word and its generalization to larger alphabets are ubiquitous in mathematics due to their rich combinatorial properties. This work addresses the k-binomial complexities of generalized TM words. Prior research by Lejeune, Leroy, and Rigo determined the k-binomial complexities of the 2-letter TM word. For larger alphabets, work by L\"u, Chen, Wen, and Wu determined the 2-binomial complexity for m-letter TM words, for arbitrary m, but the exact behavior for $k\geq 3$ remained unresolved. They conjectured that the k-binomial complexity function of the m-letter TM word is eventually periodic with period $m^k$. We resolve the conjecture positively by deriving explicit formulae for the k-binomial complexity functions for any generalized TM word. We do this by characterizing k-binomial equivalence among factors of generalized TM words. This comprehensive analysis not only solves the open conjecture, but also develops tools such as abelian Rauzy graphs.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for distance-regular graphs via long-scale Ollivier Ricci curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive new sharp diameter bounds for distance regular graphs, which better answer a problem raised by Neumaier and Penji\' c in many cases. Our proof is built upon a relation between the diameter and long-scale Ollivier Ricci curvature of a graph, which can be considered as an improvement of the discrete Bonnet-Myers theorem. Our method further leads to significant improvement of existing diameter bounds for amply regular graphs and $(s,c,a,k)$-graphs.</description>

      <title>A new way to prove configuration reducibility using gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how ideas coming out of gauge theory can be used to prove configurations in the list of ``633 unavoidable configurations" are reducible. In this paper, we prove the smallest nontrivial example, the Birkhoff diamond, is reducible using our filtered $3$- and $4$-color homology. This is a new proof of a 111-year-old result that is a direct consequence of a special (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory. As part of the proof, we introduce the idea of a state-reducible configuration. Because state-reducibility does not involve Kempe switches, this leads to an independent way to verify the proof of the four color theorem. We conjecture that these gauge theoretic ideas could also lead to a non-computer-based proof of it.</description>

      <title>On symmetric Cayley graphs of valency thirteen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cayley graph $\Ga=\Cay(G,S)$ is said to be normal if the right-regular representation of $G$ is normal in $\Aut\Ga$. In this paper, we investigate the normality problem of the connected 13-valent symmetric Cayley graphs $\Ga$ of finite nonabelian simple groups $G$, where the vertex stabilizer $\A_v$ is soluble for $\A=\Aut\Ga$ and $v\in V\Ga$. We prove that $\Ga$ is either normal or $G=\A_{12}$, $\A_{38}$, $\A_{116}$, $\A_{207}$, $\A_{311}$, $\A_{935}$ or $\A_{1871}$. Further, 13-valent symmetric non-normal Cayley graphs of $\A_{38}$, $\A_{116}$ and $\A_{207}$ are constructed. This provides some more examples of non-normal 13-valent symmetric Cayley graphs of finite nonabelian simple groups since such graph (of valency 13) was first constructed by Fang, Ma and Wang in (J. Comb. Theory A 118, 1039--1051, 2011).</description>

      <title>The basis number of 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a set of Eulerian subgraphs of a graph $G$. We say $B$ forms a $k$-basis if it is a minimum set that generates the cycle space of $G$, and any edge of $G$ lies in at most $k$ members of $B$. The basis number of a graph $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the smallest integer such that $G$ has a $k$-basis. A graph is called 1-planar (resp. planar) if it can be embedded in the plane with at most one crossing (resp. no crossing) per edge. MacLane's planarity criterion characterizes planar graphs based on their cycle space, stating that a graph is planar if and only if it has a $2$-basis. We study here the basis number of 1-planar graphs, demonstrate that it is unbounded in general, and show that it is bounded for many subclasses of 1-planar graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $hA$ denote the $h$-fold sumset of a subset $A$ of an abelian group. Nathanson asked if there exist finite sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and natural numbers $h_1&lt;h_2&lt;h_3$ such that $|h_1A|&lt;|h_1B|$, $|h_2B|&lt;|h_2A|$, and $|h_3A|&lt;|h_3B|$. We answer this question in the affirmative and establish a generalization with arbitrarily many sets and arbitrarily many values of $h$.</description>

      <title>Tropical Lagrangian coamoebae and free resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coamoebae of Lagrangian submanifolds of $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$, specifically how the combinatorics of their degenerations encodes the homological algebra of mirror coherent sheaves. Concretely, to a minimal free resolution $F^\bullet$ of a module $M$ over $\mathbb{C}[z_1^{\pm 1}, \dotsc, z_n^{\pm 1}]$ we associate a simplicial complex $T(F^\bullet) \subset T^n$. We call $T(F^\bullet)$ a tropical Lagrangian coamoeba. We show that the discrete information in $F^\bullet$ can often be recovered from $T(F^\bullet)$, and that more generally $M$ is mirror to a certain constructible sheaf supported on $T(F^\bullet)$. The resulting interplay between coherent sheaves on $(\mathbb{C}^\times)^n$ and simplicial complexes in $T^n$ provides a higher-dimensional generalization of the spectral theory of dimer models in $T^2$, as well as a symplectic counterpart to the theory of brane brick models.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a metric on the set of permutations of given order, which is a weighted generalization of Kendall's $\tau$ rank distance and study its properties. Using the edge graph of a permutohedron, we give a criterion which guarantees that a permutation lies metrically between another two fixed permutations. In addition, the conditions under which four points from the resulting metric space form a pseudolinear quadruple were found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graded M\"{o}bius algebra of a matroid is a commutative graded algebra which encodes the combinatorics of the lattice of flats of the matroid. As a special subalgebra of the augmented Chow ring of the matroid, it plays an important role in the recent proof of the Dowling-Wilson Top Heavy Conjecture. Recently, Mastroeni and McCullough proved that the Chow ring and the augmented Chow ring of a matroid are Koszul. We study when graded M\"obius algebras are Koszul. We characterize the Koszul graded M\"obius algebras of cycle matroids of graphs in terms of properties of the graphs. Our results yield a new characterization of strongly chordal graphs via edge orderings.</description>

      <title>Modularity of Some Nahm Sums as Vector-valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zagier observed that modular Nahm sums associated with the same matrix may form a vector-valued modular function on some congruence subgroup. We establish modular transformation formulas for several families of Nahm sums by viewing them as vector-valued functions, and thereby we show that they are indeed modular on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N=1,2,3,4$. In particular, we prove two transformation formulas discovered by Mizuno related to the Kanade--Russell mod 9 conjecture and Capparelli's identities. We also establish vector-valued transformation formulas for some theta series. As applications, we give modular transformation formulas for various families of Nahm sums involving those in the Andrews--Gordon identities and Bressoud's identities.</description>

      <title>Excluding Surfaces as Minors in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Graph Minors Structure Theorem (GMST) of Robertson and Seymour states that for every graph $H,$ any $H$-minor-free graph $G$ has a tree-decomposition of bounded adhesion such that the torso of every bag embeds in a surface $\Sigma$ where $H$ does not embed after removing a small number of apex vertices and confining some vertices into a bounded number of bounded depth vortices. However, the functions involved in the original form of this statement were not explicit. In an enormous effort Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan proved a similar statement with explicit (and single-exponential in $|V(H)|$) bounds. However, their proof replaces the statement ``a surface where $H$ does not embed'' with `` a surface of Euler-genus in $\mathcal{O}(|H|^2)$''. In this paper we close this gap and prove that the bounds of Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan can be achieved with a tight bound on the Euler-genus. Moreover, we provide a more refined version of the GMST focussed exclusively on excluding, instead of a single graph, grid-like graphs that are minor-universal for a given set of surfaces. This allows us to give a description, in the style of Robertson and Seymour, of graphs excluding a graph of fixed Euler-genus as a minor, rather than focussing on the size of the graph.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove some and conjecture other results regarding the distribution of descent top and descent bottom sets on some pattern-avoiding permutations. In particular, for 3-letter patterns, we show bijectively that the set of descent tops and the set of descent bottoms are jointly equidistributed on the avoiders of 231 and 312. We also conjecture similar equidistributions for 4-letter patterns, in particular, that the set of descent tops and the set of descent bottoms are jointly equidistributed on the avoiders of 3142, 3241, 4132. This conjecture and several others made in this paper have now been proved by Zhou, Zang, and Yan.</description>

      <title>Resonance graphs of plane bipartite graphs as daisy cubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize plane bipartite graphs whose resonance graphs are daisy cubes, and therefore generalize related results on resonance graphs of benzenoid graphs, catacondensed even ring systems, as well as 2-connected outerplane bipartite graphs. Firstly, we prove that if $G$ is a plane elementary bipartite graph other than $K_2$, then the resonance graph of $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if the Fries number of $G$ equals the number of finite faces of $G$. Next, we extend the above characterization from plane elementary bipartite graphs to plane bipartite graphs and show that the resonance graph of a plane bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if $G$ is weakly elementary bipartite such that each of its elementary component $G_i$ other than $K_2$ holds the property that the Fries number of $G_i$ equals the number of finite faces of $G_i$. Along the way, we provide a structural characterization for a plane elementary bipartite graph whose resonance graph is a daisy cube, and show that a Cartesian product graph is a daisy cube if and only if all of its nontrivial factors are daisy cubes.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, under some mild conditions on $\vec{q}$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; that is, we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This semi-expository article presents an inductive method of computing initial ideals and Gr\"obner bases for families of ideals in a polynomial ring. This method starts from a given set of pairs $(I,J)$ where $I$ is any ideal and $J$ is a monomial ideal contained in the initial ideal of $I$. These containments become a system of equalities if one can establish a particular transition recurrence among the chosen ideals. We describe explicit constructions of such systems in two motivating cases -- namely, for the ideals of matrix Schubert varieties and their skew-symmetric analogues. Despite many formal similarities with these examples, for the symmetric versions of matrix Schubert varieties, it is an open problem to construct the same kind of transition system. We present several conjectures that would follow from such a construction, while also discussing the special obstructions arising in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>On the number of $k$-mers admitting a given lexicographical minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimizer of a word of size $k$ (a $k$-mer) is defined as its smallest substring of size $m$ (with $m\leq k$), according to some ordering on $m$-mers. minimizers have been used in bioinformatics -- notably -- to partition sequencing datasets, binning together $k$-mers that share the same minimizer. It is folklore that using the lexicographical order lead to very unbalanced partitions, resulting in an abundant literature devoted to devising alternative orders for achieving better balanced partitions. To the best of our knowledge, the unbalanced-ness of lexicographical-based minimizer partitions has never been investigated from a theoretical point of view. In this article, we aim to fill this gap and determine, for a given minimizer, how many $k$-mers would admit the chosen minimizer -- i.e. what would be the size of the bucket associated to the chosen minimizer in the worst case, where all $k$-mers would be seen in the data. We show that this number can be computed in $O(km)$ space and $O(km^2)$ time. We further introduce approximations that can be computed in $O(k)$ space and $O(km)$ time. We also show on genomic datasets that the practical number of $k$-mers associated to a minimizer are closely correlated to the theoretical expected number. We introduce two conjectures that could help closely approximating the total number of $k$-mers sharing a minimizer. We believe that characterising the distribution of the number of $k$-mers per minimizer will help devise efficient lexicographic-based minimizer bucketting.</description>
