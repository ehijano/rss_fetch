      <title>Neutrino Program at Fermilab -- Enhancing proton beam power and accelerator infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming long baseline neutrino experiments aim to enhance proton beam power to multi-MW scale and utilize large-scale detectors to address the challenge of limited event statistics. The DUNE experiment at LBNF will test the three neutrino flavor paradigm and directly search for CP violation by studying oscillation signatures in the high intensity $\nu_{\mu}$ (anti-$\nu_{\mu}$) beam to $\nu_{e}$ (anti-$\nu_{e}$) measured over a long baseline. Higher beam power and improved accelerator up-time will enhance neutrino flux for the neutrino program by increasing the number of protons on target. LBNF/DUNE, as well as PIP-II upgrade and Accelerator Complex Evolution (ACE) plan, play a vital role in this effort. The scientific potential of ACE plan extends beyond neutrino physics, encompassing endeavors such as the Muon Collider, Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV), Dark Sectors, and exploration of neutrinos beyond DUNE.\par In the era of higher-power accelerator operation , research in target materials and beam instrumentation is crucial for optimizing design modifications. This abstract discusses Fermilab ACE, the science opportunities it provides, and how Fermilab is pushing the limits of proton beam power and accelerator infrastructure. By tackling neutrino beam challenges and exploring research and development ideas, we are advancing our understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous and Retarded Interactions in Coherent Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coherent radiation of an ensemble of electrons, radiation field from electrons resonantly drives the other electrons inside to produce stimulated emission. The radiation reaction force on the electrons accounting for this stimulated radiation loss is classically described by the Lienard-Wiechert potential. Despite its being the foundation of beam physics for decades, we show that using the "acceleration field'' in Lienard-Wiechert potential to describe radiative interactions leads to divergences due to its implicit dependence on instantaneous interactions. Here, we propose an alternative theory for electromagnetic radiation by decomposing the interactions into instantaneous part and retarded part. It is shown that only the retarded part contributes to the irreversible radiation loss and the instantaneous part describes the space charge related effects. We further apply this theory to study the coherent synchrotron radiation wake, which hopefully will reshape our understanding of coherent radiation and collective interactions.</description>
