      <title>The Preparation Status and Plan for the Next Physics Run of the NINJA Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NINJA experiment aims to precisely measure neutrino-nucleus interactions using a nuclear emulsion detector to reduce systematic errors in neutrino oscillation experiments. The nuclear emulsion has a sub-micron positional resolution, enabling the detection of low-momentum charged particles such as protons with a threshold of 200 MeV/c. In the NINJA experiment, a muon detector placed downstream of the emulsion detector is used to identify muons from $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current interactions. The majority of the tracks accumulated in the nuclear emulsion are from cosmic rays. Although the emulsion detector provides highly accurate positional information, it lacks timing information. Therefore, the positional resolution of the muon detector is not enough to identify neutrino interaction tracks that match between the muon detector and the emulsion detector from the enormous background of cosmic rays recorded in the emulsion detector. To address this, a scintillation tracker is used to provide both timing and positional information for the tracks.
  The NINJA experiment is planning a third physics run with about 130 kg water target from the autumn of 2025 to the spring of 2026. Since the target mass is larger than previous runs, a larger scintillation tracker covering 1.3 m $\times$ 1.4 m is needed. We are developing a newly designed scintillation tracker, consisting of a monolithic plastic scintillator plane including scatterers.
  In this paper, we will show the preparation status and plan for the next physics run, focusing particularly on the development of the new scintillation tracker.</description>

      <title>Extending the time-over-threshold calibration of Timepix3 for spatial-resolved ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid pixel detectors have a well-established array of applications ranging from particle physics to life sciences. The small dimensions of Timepix3 as well as its relatively low energetic expenses make it an intriguing option additionally for ion detection in nuclear physics experiments, as it reveals simultaneously precise temporal, spatial and energetic properties of recorded events from nuclear reactions. Currently, a limiting factor is the electronics behavior at high input charge resulting in improper energy determination of incident heavier ions. While the low-energy per-pixel calibration of Timepix3 is normally performed with the use of photons of up to 60 keV, the characteristic linear range permits a correct extrapolation up to only 150 keV/pixel. We developed a global per-pixel energy correction method involving the use of short-ranged accelerated ions and spectroscopic alpha sources, to suitably extend the energy determination capability of Timepix3 for nuclear ion spectroscopy experiments, where spatial and temporal precision of recorded events are equally crucial. It was found that upon applying this correction, the reliable per-pixel energy range has been increased from the original 150 keV to at least 1.1 MeV, while maintaining the relative energy resolution to better than 2.5% for stopped protons of up to 1.9 MeV and better than 3.1% for alpha particles of 5.5 MeV. Furthermore, to demonstrate the spatial resolution of Timepix3 detectors with silicon sensors, we present alpha-radiography measurements from which we extract the modulation transfer function (MTF) and produce real-world biological sample images.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Pulse Tube Vibrations from a Dry Dilution Refrigerator at milli-Kelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising adoption of dry dilution refrigerators across scientific and industrial domains, there has been a pressing demand for highly efficient vibration decoupling systems capable of operation at cryogenic temperatures in order to achieve the low vibration levels required for operation of sensitive equipment like cryogenic detectors or quantum devices. As part of the NUCLEUS experiment, a cryogenic spring pendulum has been engineered to effectively isolate pulse tube vibrations by establishing an autonomous frame of reference for the experimental volume, while sustaining temperatures below 10 mK. Attaining attenuation of up to two orders of magnitude within the region of interest of the NUCLEUS cryogenic detectors, we achieved displacement RMS values in the order of 1 nm in the axial direction and 100 pm radially, thereby reducing vibrations below typical environmental levels. Our successful detector operation across multiple cooldown cycles demonstrated negligible sensitivity to pulse tube induced vibrations, culminating in the achievement of an ultra-low $(6.22 \pm 0.07)$ eV baseline resolution on a gram-scale CaWO$_4$ cryogenic calorimeter during continuous pulse tube operation over the course of several weeks.</description>

      <title>Integrating IPbus ALFRED into the ALICE-FIT setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The official data collection for the Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva commenced on July 5, 2022, following approximately three and a half years of maintenance, upgrades, and commissioning. Among the many upgrades to ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the new Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector. Constant improvements to FIT's hardware, firmware, and software will enable progressively better performance. Between November 2024 and March 2025, during the year-end technical stop, an update to the communication path between the Front-End Electronics (FEE) and the Detector Control System (DCS) is planned. This update will introduce a new approach based on the ALFRED (ALICE Low-Level Front-End Device) software, supported by the central DCS ALICE system. To address the challenge of integrating custom electronics with distributed control systems, this paper describes a novel extension of the Front-End Device (FRED) framework, which can interface bespoke electronics with standard SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems using IPbus. This framework can be applied to all detectors utilizing IPbus communication.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted design of experiments at the frontiers of computation: methods and new perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing the next generation colliders and detectors involves solving optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces where the optimal solutions may nest in regions that even a team of expert humans would not explore.
  Resorting to Artificial Intelligence to assist the experimental design introduces however significant computational challenges in terms of generation and processing of the data required to perform such optimizations: from the software point of view, differentiable programming makes the exploration of such spaces with gradient descent feasible; from the hardware point of view, the complexity of the resulting models and their optimization is prohibitive. To scale up to the complexity of the typical HEP collider experiment, a change in paradigma is required.
  In this contribution I will describe the first proofs-of-concept of gradient-based optimization of experimental design and implementations in neuromorphic hardware architectures, paving the way to more complex challenges.</description>

      <title>The ENUBET monitored neutrino beam and its implementation at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ENUBET project recently concluded the R&amp;D for a site independent design of a monitored neutrino beam for high precision cross section measurements, in which the neutrino flux is inferred from the measurement of charged leptons in an instrumented decay tunnel. In this phase three fundamental results were obtained and will be discussed here: 1) a beamline not requiring a horn and relying on static focusing elements allows to perform a $\nu_e$ cross section measurement in the DUNE energy range with 1% statistical uncertainty employing $10^{20}$ 400 GeV protons on target (pot) and a neutrino detector of the size of ProtoDUNE; 2) the instrumentation of the decay tunnel, based on a cost effective sampling calorimeter solution, has been tested with a large scale prototype achieving the performance required to identify positrons and muons from kaon decays with high signal-to-noise ratio; 3) the systematics budget on the neutrino flux is constrained at the 1% level by fitting the charged leptons observables measured in the decay tunnel. Based on these successful results ENUBET is now pursuing a study for a site dependent implementation at CERN in the framework of Physics Beyond Colliders. In this context a new beamline, able to enrich the neutrino flux at the energy of HK and to reduce by more than a factor 3 the needed pot, has been designed and is being optimized. The civil engineering and radioprotection studies for the siting of ENUBET in the North Area towards the two ProtoDUNEs are also in the scope of this work, with the goal of proposing a neutrino cross section experiment in 2026. The combined use of both the neutrino detectors and of the improved beamline would allow to perform cross section measurements with unprecedented precision in about 5 years with a proton request compatible with the needs of other users after CERN Long Shutdown 3.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel methods and technology drive the rapid advances of nuclear magnetic resonance. The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to improve sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation has made NMR much more convenient to use than before, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms without regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and SNR as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei on three devices. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer (Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of RG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from supposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7 and 9.4 T spectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal showed the expected approximately linear increase with RG, but we found an unexpected, drastic drop of SNR for X-nuclei: For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar to that at a maximum RG of 101, the obtained SNR was 46% higher than at RG = 20.2. These unexpected results suggest that NMR users may want to calibrate spectrometer settings to obtain the optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics. In this context, we provide a method to estimate optimal settings for thermally and hyperpolarized samples of a chosen concentration, polarization, and flip angle, which provide a high SNR and avoid ADC-overflow artifacts.</description>

      <title>Laboratory and beam-test performance study of a 55$~\mu$m pitch iLGAD sensor bonded to a Timepix3 readout chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution reports on characterisation results of a large-area (2$~\mathrm{cm}^2$) small pitch (55$~\mu$m) inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD), bonded to a Timepix3 readout chip. The ilGAD sensors were produced by Micron Semiconductor Ltd with the goal to obtain good gain uniformity and maximise the fill-factor -- an issue present with standard small-pitch LGAD designs. We have conducted detailed performance evaluations using both X-ray calibrations and beam tests. An X-ray fluorescence setup has been used to obtain energy calibration and to identify the optimal operating settings of the new devices, whereas the extensive beam tests allowed for a detailed evaluation of the detector performance. The beam-tests were performed at the CERN SPS North Area H6 beamline, using a 120 GeV/c pion beam. The reference tracking and time-stamping is achieved by a Timepix3-based beam telescope setup.
  The results show a gain of around 5 with very good uniformity, measured across the whole gain area, as well as a hit time resolution down to 1.3 ns without correcting for the time-walk effects. Furthermore, it is shown that the gain opens the possibility of a good X-ray energy resolution down to 4.5 keV.</description>

      <title>Nuclear fuel imaging using position-sensitive detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are evaluating the performance of a Passive Gamma Emission Tomography (PGET) device equipped with 3D position-sensitive cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) gamma-ray detectors when used for inspecting spent nuclear fuel assemblies (SFAs). Recent advancements in imaging detector technology may offer a method to extend the capabilities of such devices beyond standard safeguards applications, allowing an efficient non-invasive way to accurately characterise the properties of nuclear fuel assemblies. The efficiency of the currently used small CZT detectors is restricted by the limited likelihood of full gamma-ray absorption, which is needed for optimal imaging information. Employing larger CZT detectors would increase the probability of capturing the full energy of gamma rays, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the PGET device and the quality of the reconstructed images. Large CZT detectors need to be position-sensitive to determine through which collimator slit a gamma ray travelled. Position sensitivity results from the pixelated readout of the CZT crystals. Pixelation potentially increases the spatial resolution of the system, which is currently determined by the collimator used. Pixelation allows resolving the position of arrival up to (readout pitch)/$\sqrt{12}$. We are additionally exploring the potential of utilising Compton imaging to provide information on the origin of gamma rays along the SFA. A simulation is created using Geant4 to compare the full photon absorption efficiency of large and current, small, crystals. Gamma rays of energy 661.7 keV and 1274 keV are targeted to the model describing the approved apparatus now equipped with 22 mm x 22 mm x 10 mm crystals of CZT. It is observed that the efficiency for photon absorption in this case is greatly increased when compared to the existing detectors.</description>

Abstract: The goal of the FNAL E989 experiment is to measure the muon magnetic anomaly to unprecedented accuracy and precision at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. To meet this goal, the time and space averaged magnetic environment in the muon storage volume must be known to better than 70 ppb. A new pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetometer was designed and built at the University of Washington, Seattle to track the temporal stability of the 1.45T magnetic field in the muon storage ring at this precision. It consists of an array of 378 petroleum jelly based NMR probes that are embedded in the walls of muon storage ring vacuum chambers and custom electronics built with readily available modular radio frequency (RF) components. We give NMR probe construction details and describe the functions of the custom electronic subsystems. The excellent performance metrics of the magnetometer are discussed, where after 8 years of operation the median single shot resolution of the array of probes remains at 650 ppb.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>

Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with unprecented energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to characterize the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic model for time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve vertex position resolution better than 20mm, energy resolution of about 2% at 1MeV and &lt;0.5% non-uniformity, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. With such resolution, we perceive MeV events to exhibit track effects. It opens up an exciting possibility of computed tracking calorimeter for unsegmented liquid scintillator detector like TAO. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00091</link>

Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Testing of the APOLLO ATCA Blades for Use at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Apollo Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) platform is an open-source design consisting of a generic "Service Module" (SM) and a customizable "Command Module" (CM), allowing for cost-effective use in applications such as the readout of the inner tracker and the Level-1 track trigger for the CMS Phase-II upgrade at the HL-LHC. The SM integrates an intelligent IPMC, robust power entry and conditioning systems, a powerful system-on-module computer, and flexible clock and communication infrastructure. The CM is designed around two Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs and high-density, high-bandwidth optical transceivers capable of 25 Gb/s. Crates of Apollo blades are currently being tested at Boston University, Cornell University, and CERN.</description>
