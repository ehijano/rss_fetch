      <title>The Parisi-Sourlas Uplift and Infinitely Many Solvable 4d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry is known to emerge in some models with random field type of disorder. When PS SUSY is present the $d$-dimensional theory allows for a $d-2$-dimensional description. In this paper we investigate the reversed question and we provide new indications that any given CFT$_{d-2}$ can be uplifted to a PS SUSY CFT$_{d}$. We show that any scalar four-point function of a CFT$_{d-2}$ is mapped to a set of 43 four-point functions of the uplifted CFT$_{d}$ which are related to each other by SUSY and satisfy all necessary bootstrap axioms. As a byproduct we find 43 non trivial relations between conformal blocks across dimensions.
  We test the uplift in generalized free field theory (GFF) and find that PS SUSY is a powerful tool to bootstrap an infinite class of previously unknown GFF observables. Some of this power is shown to persist in perturbation theory around GFF.
  We explain why all diagonal minimal models admit an uplift and we show exact results for correlators and CFT data of the $4d$ uplift of the Ising model. Despite being strongly coupled $4d$ CFTs, the uplifted minimal models contain infinitely many conserved currents and are expected to be integrable.</description>

      <title>Hidden sectors of Chern-Simons Matter theories and Exact Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral higher-spin gravity is a higher-spin extension of both self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity and is a unique local higher-spin gravity in four dimensions. Its existence implies that there are two closed subsectors in Chern-Simons matter theories. We make first steps in identifying these (anti-)chiral subsectors directly on the CFT side, which should result in a holographically dual pair where both sides are nontrivial, complete, yet exactly soluble. We also discuss closely related theories: self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) and self-dual gravity (SDGR) in the holographic context.</description>

      <title>Higher spins and Finsler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This is however not enough to eliminate non-transverse modes, at least for some versions of Finsler dynamics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>Subleading analysis for $S^3$ partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the 3-sphere partition functions of various 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic SCFTs arising from the $N$ stack of M2-branes in the 't Hooft limit both analytically and numerically. We first employ a saddle point approximation to evaluate the free energy $F=-\log Z$ at the planar level, tracking the first subleading corrections in the large 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ expansion. Subsequently, we improve these results by determining the planar free energy to all orders in the large $\lambda$ expansion via numerical analysis. Remarkably, the resulting planar free energies turn out to take a universal form, supporting a prediction that these $S^3$ partition functions are all given in terms of an Airy function even beyond the special cases where the Airy formulae were derived analytically in the literature; in this context we also present new Airy conjectures in several examples. The subleading behaviors we captured encode a part of quantum corrections to the M-theory path integrals around dual asymptotically Euclidean AdS$_4$ backgrounds with the corresponding internal manifolds through holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Gravitational algebras and the generalized second law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the generalized second law (GSL) for arbitrary cuts of Killing horizons from the perspective of crossed-product gravitational algebras, making use of a recent proposal by one of us for the construction of local gravitational algebras. This construction relies on the existence of a state whose modular flow is geometric on the horizon. In both free and interacting quantum field theories, such states are guaranteed to exist by the properties of half-sided translations on the horizon. Using geometric identities derived from the canonical analysis of general relativity on null surfaces, we show that the crossed product entropy agrees with the generalized entropy of the horizon cut in a semiclassical limit, and further reproduce Wall's result relating the GSL to monotonicity of relative entropy of the quantum field algebras. We also give a novel generalization of the GSL for interacting theories in asymptotically flat spacetimes involving the concept of an algebra at infinity for a half-sided translation, which accounts for triviality of the algebra of fields smeared only on the horizon. Going beyond the semiclassical limit, we compute subleading corrections to the crossed product entropy, but are unable to determine if the GSL continues to hold after accounting for these. We speculate that an improved GSL could follow from a hidden subalgebra structure of the crossed products, assuming the existence of an operator-valued weight between horizon cut algebras.</description>

      <title>A positive metric over DGKT vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of a metric over the space of AdS solution in string theory, leading to an associated distance between them. Such a distance is the idea underlying the AdS distance conjecture. We utilise the previously developed prescription for extracting such a metric: taking an off-shell quadratic variation of the string theory effective action and then evaluating it over the space of on-shell solutions. It was shown that this prescription leads to a well-defined positive metric over M-theory Freud-Rubin vacua. In this work, we use the same prescription to calculate the metric over type IIA DGKT vacua. These are much more involved, they have multiple flux parameters and exhibit scale separation. While it remains an open question whether these vacua exist as fully localised solutions of string theory, they are well-defined within the four-dimensional effective theory, which is all that is required for the calculation. We find that they also have a positive metric over them. Interestingly, this metric turns out to be independent of the many flux parameters in the solution, similarly to what happens for metrics over scalar field spaces. This non-trivial flux cancellation, as well as results from explicit vacua, lead us to propose a Swampland condition: that the metric over the space of vacua in quantum gravity, as defined by the above prescription, is always positive.</description>

      <title>2d Ising Critical Couplings from Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an exact holographic duality formula between the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model and 3d quantum gravity, we provide a formula for "real" zeroes of the 2d Ising partition function on finite graphs in terms of the geometry of a 2d triangulation embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex phase of those zeroes is given by the dihedral angles of the triangulation, which reflect its extrinsic curvature within the ambient 3d space, while the modulus is given by the angles within the 2d triangles, thus encoding the intrinsic geometry of the triangulation. Our formula can not cover the whole set of Ising zeroes, but we conjecture that a suitable complexification of these "real" zeroes would provide a more thorough formula. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit, in the case of flat planar 2d triangulations, our Ising zeroes formula gives the critical couplings for isoradial graphs, confirming its generality. This approach shows an intricate, but precise, new relation between statistical mechanics and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Note on holographic torus stress tensor correlators in $AdS_3$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ framework, the Euclidean BTZ black hole corresponds to the dominant high-temperature phase of its dual field theory. We initially employ perturbative methods to solve the Einstein equations as boundary value problems, providing correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator at low points. Utilizing operator equations established in our previous work, we further compute arbitrary high-point correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator in the high-temperature phase and recursive relations for these high-point functions. Concurrently, we employ the Chern-Simons formalism to derive consistent results. Further, using the cut-off AdS/$T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT duality, we calculate the energy-momentum tensor correlators, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics. Finally, stress tensor correlators enable us to ascertain the corresponding KdV operator correlators at low-temperature.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Scale of Quadratic Gravity from Quantum Focusing Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the cutoff length scale of the quadratic gravity in $d \geq 5$ dimensional spacetime by demanding that the quantum focusing conjecture for the smeared quantum expansion holds at the classical level. The cutoff scale has different dependence on the spacetime dimension depending on the sign of the coupling constant of the quadratic gravity. We also investigate a concrete example of the 5-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime and directly confirm that the quantum focusing conjecture holds when the quantum expansion is smeared over the scale larger than our cutoff scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical localised configurations - solitons - in a theory of self-interacting complex Proca field with the global $U(1)$ symmetry. We focus on spherically-symmetric solitons near the nonrelativistic limit, which are supported by the quartic interactions of the neutral Proca field. Such solitons can source the radial electric (magnetic) field if one introduces a parity-even (parity-odd) coupling of the Proca field to the electromagnetic field tensor. We discuss the conditions of existence of such nontopological ''electromagnetic hedgehogs'' and their properties.</description>

      <title>Inflationary complexity of thermal state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the inflationary complexity of the two-mode squeezed state with thermal effect for the single field inflation, modified dispersion relation, and non-trivial sound speed with the method of closed system and open system, respectively, which our analysis is valid for most inflationary models. First, the numeric of Krylov complexity in the method of the closed system indicates that the evolution of Krylov complexity highly depends on the squeezed angle parameter once taking the thermal effect into account, which will decay into some very tiny values, but the Krylov complexity will always enhance without thermal effect. For comparison, the numeric of circuit complexity shows that the evolution is always increasing no matter whether there are thermal effects or not which is independent of the evolution of squeezed angle parameter. By utilizing the method of open system, we first construct the wave function. As for the Krylov complexity with the method of open system, our investigations show the evolution of Krylov complexity will enhance upon some peaks factoring in the thermal effects. For completeness, we also calculate the Krylov entropy in the method of closed system and open system, which indicates that the hotter universe, the more chaotic the universe. Furthermore, our derivation for the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover into the case of closed system under weak dissipative approximation, which confirms the validity of construction for the wave function. Finally, our numeric of Lanczos coefficient shows that the non-trivial sound speed has minimal chaos compared to the other two cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Lifshitz black holes with arbitrary dynamical exponent are addressed in the fluid/gravity membrane paradigm. The transport and the response coefficients in the dual Lifshitz field theory are calculated and analyzed, including the charge diffusion constant and the shear mode damping constant, along with the shear-viscosity-to-entropy density ratio. The Kubo formula is employed to obtain the electrical DC conductivity for the gauge sector corresponding to impurity through the holographic linear response of gauge vector fluctuations in the Lifshitz black brane geometry.</description>

      <title>Centerless-BMS charge algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, the resulting charges realize the BMS symmetry algebra without any 2-cocycle nor central extension, at any cut of future null infinity. We refine the covariance prescription for application to the charge aspects, and introduce a new aspect for Geroch's super-momentum with better covariance properties. For the extended BMS symmetry with singular conformal Killing vectors we find that a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential exists, if one is willing to modify the symplectic structure by a corner term. The resulting algebra of Noether currents between two arbitrary cuts is center-less. The charge algebra at a given cut has a residual field-dependent 2-cocycle, but time-independent and non-radiative. More precisely, super-rotation fluxes act covariantly, but super-rotation charges act covariantly only on global translations. The take home message is that in any situation where 2-cocycles appears in the literature, covariance has likely been lost in the charge prescription, and that the criterium of covariance is a powerful one to reduce ambiguities in the charges, and can be used also for ambiguities in the charge aspects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the effects of pole dark energy on the evolution of gravitational waves. The background evolution of gravitational waves in a flat FRW universe is considered and its dynamics are studied in the presence of pole dark energy. Two different potential functions are considered for the study. Using the field equations, we formulated the perturbed equations governing the evolution of gravitational waves with respect to redshift z within the background of the FRW Universe. Subsequently, we delved into the characteristics of gravitational waves for the pole dark energy model and reached interesting results.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) analysis from the first year of data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), when combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has placed an upper-limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu &lt; 70$ meV (95%). In addition to excluding the minimum sum associated with the inverted hierarchy, the posterior is peaked at $\sum m_\nu = 0$ and is close to excluding even the minumum sum, 58 meV at 2$\sigma$. In this paper, we explore the implications of this data for cosmology and particle physics. The sum of neutrino mass is determined in cosmology from the suppression of clustering in the late universe. Allowing the clustering to be enhanced, we extended the DESI analysis to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ and find $\sum m_\nu = - 160 \pm 90$ meV (68%), and that the suppression of power from the minimum sum of neutrino masses is excluded at 99% confidence. We show this preference for negative masses makes it challenging to explain the result by a shift of cosmic parameters, such as the optical depth or matter density. We then show how a result of $\sum m_\nu =0$ could arise from new physics in the neutrino sector, including decay, cooling, and/or time-dependent masses. These models are consistent with current observations but imply new physics that is accessible in a wide range of experiments. In addition, we discuss how an apparent signal with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0$ can arise from new long range forces in the dark sector or from a primordial trispectrum that resembles the signal of CMB lensing.</description>

      <title>IR-fixed Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on the global de Sitter space, obtained from the Euclidean Green's function on the 4-sphere. We use the notion of Calder\'on projectors to recover a quantum state for the Lorentzian theory on de Sitter space. We show that while the state is gauge invariant and Hadamard, it is not positive on the whole of the phase space. We show however that a suitable modification at low energies yields a well-defined Hadamard state on global de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed at which the GW propagates The speed at which the GW propagates going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Summing Gravitational Effects from Loops of Inflationary Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for re-summing the large logarithms induced in gravity by loops of inflationary scalars. We first show how the scalar can be integrated out of the field equations in the presence of constant graviton field. We then extend this result to a fully conserved form which explains the need for a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant which was previously inferred from explicit computation. A variant of the renormalization group turns out to explain the large logarithmic corrections revealed by explicit computation in the electric field strength of gravitational radiation and in the potentials which characterize the response to a point mass. The implications for graviton loops are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Observations on representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group and algebra in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical quantisation of General Relativity including matter on a spacetime manifold in the globally hyperbolic setting involves in particular the representation theory of the spatial diffeomorphism group (SDG), and/or its Lie algebra (SDA), of the underlying spatial submanifold. There are well known Fock representations of the SDA in one spatial dimension and non-Fock representations of the SDG in all dimensions. The latter are not strongly continuous and do not descend to representations of the SDA.
  In this work we report some partial results on non anomalous representations of the SDA for both geometry and matter: 1. Background independent Fock representations of the SDA by operators exist in all dimensions. 2. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA by operators exist in one dimension but these do not extend to higher dimensions. 3. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA of volume preserving diffeomorphisms by operators exist in all dimensions. 4. Infinitely many unitary equivalence classes of background dependent Fock representations of the SDA by quadratic forms exist in all dimensions.
  Except for 1. these representations do not descend from an invariant state of the Weyl algebra and 4. points to a new strategy for solving the quantum constraints.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Gravity in Fock representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum gravity starts from prescribing a background metric. That background metric is then used in order to carry out two separate steps: 1. One splits the non-perturbative metric into background and deviation from it (graviton) and expands the action in terms of the graviton which results in an ifinite series of unknown radius of convergence. 2. One constructs a Fock representation for the graviton and performs perturbative graviton quantum field theory on the fixed background as dictated by the perturbative action. The result is a non-renormalisable theory without predictive power.
  It is therefore widely believed that a non-perturbative approach is mandatory in order to construct a fundamental, not only effective, predictive quantum field theory of the gravitational interaction. Since perturbation theory is by definition background dependent, the notions of background dependence (BD) and perturbation theory (PT) are often considered as symbiotic, as if they imply each other.
  In the present work we point out that there is no such symbiosis, these two notions are in fact logically independent. In particular, one can use BD structures while while not using PT at all. Specifically, we construct BD Fock representations (step 2 above) for the full, non-perturbative metric rather than the graviton (not step 1 above) and therefore never perform a perturbative expansion. Despite the fact that the gravitational Lagrangean is a non-polynomial, not even analytic, function of the metric we show that e.g. the Hamiltonian constraint with any density weight can be defined as a quadratic form with dense form domain in such a representation.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the intricate relationship between the q-boson model, a quantum integrable system, and classical integrable systems such as the Toda and KP hierarchies. Initially, we analyze scalar products of off-shell Bethe states and explore their connections to tau functions of integrable hierarchies. Furthermore, we discuss correlation functions within this formalism, examining their representations in terms of tau functions, as well as their Schur polynomial expansions.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Lorentzian Spin-foams and Semiclassical Space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is developed in the context of the spin-foam approach to quantum gravity; all results are concerned with the Lorentzian theory and with semiclassical methods. A correspondence is given between Majorana 2-spinors and time-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski 3-space based on complexified quaternions. It is shown that the former suggest a symplectic structure on the spinor phase space which, together with an area-matching constraint, yields a symplectomorphism to $T^*\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. A complete 3-dimensional Lorentzian spin-foam amplitude for both space- and time-like triangles is proposed. It is shown to asymptote to Regge theory in the semiclassical regime. The asymptotic limit of the 4-dimensional Conrady-Hnybida model for general polytopes is scrutinized. Minkowski's theorem on convex polyhedra is generalized to Lorentzian signature, and new boundary states for time-like polygons are introduced. It is found that the semiclassical amplitude for such polygons is insufficiently constrained. A method for the asymptotic evaluation of integrals subject to external parameters is discussed. The method is developed in detail for the special problem of spin-foam gluing constraints away from their dominant critical points. A relation to the gluing constraints of effective spin-foams is suggested.</description>

      <title>Arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology and group field theory, predict the resolution of the initial cosmological singularity via a 'bounce': a regular spacetime region that connects the expanding branch of the universe to a contracting branch. The cosmological arrow of time, which by definition points in the direction of cosmic expansion, is reversed at the bounce. Nonetheless, it is still possible to discriminate between the two branches by considering different arrows, as defined for instance by the growth of perturbations. After reviewing general aspects of the time arrow problem in cosmology, we examine the properties of different arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the loop quantum cosmology bounce as a case study. We also present a new exact solution to the effective Friedmann equations of loop quantum cosmology with pressureless dust and a cosmological constant, which is a simplified version of the $\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario, where these issues can be examined in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gertsenshtein effect could in principle be used to detect a single graviton by firing it through a region filled with a constant magnetic field that enables its conversion to a photon, which can be efficiently detected via standard techniques. The quantization of the gravitational field could then be inferred indirectly. We show that for currently available single-photon detector technology, the Gertsenshtein detector is generically inefficient, meaning that the probability of detection is $\ll 1$. The Gertsenshtein detector can become efficient on astrophysical scales for futuristic single-photon detectors sensitive to frequencies in the Hz to kHz range. It is not clear whether such devices are in principle possible.</description>

Considering both orbifold and fermionization, we establish a connection between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging procedures and modifications of the momentum lattice by vectors characterizing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We also provide three-dimensional interpretations of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gaugings through abelian Chern-Simons theories, which act as symmetry topological field theories.</description>

Abstract: We construct a doped holographic superconductor in the Gubser-Rocha model, and realize a superconducting dome in the middle of the temperature-doping phase diagram. It is worth noting that unlike the previous researches, the profile of our dome shrinks inward near zero temperature. From the numerical observation for the coupling dependence of the phase diagram, we find that the coupling between the two gauge fields plays a crucial role in the formation of dome. We also analytically calculate the DC conductivity of the normal phase of the system in the momentum dissipation and obtain the resistivity which is proportional to temperature. The AC conductivity is calculated numerically.</description>

Abstract: We discuss relations between closed and open string amplitudes at one-loop. While at tree-level these relations are known as Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) and/or double copy relations, here we investigate how such relations are manifested at one-loop. While there exist examples of one-loop closed string amplitudes that can strikingly be written as sum over squares of one-loop open string amplitudes, generically the one-loop closed string amplitudes assume a form reminiscent from the one-loop doubly copy structure of gravitational amplitudes involving a loop momentum. This double copy structure represents the one-loop generalization of the KLT relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second installment of a series of two papers on the $\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS Wilson line defect CFT in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, we focus on dynamical aspects of the theory, in particular studying four-point functions with analytic bootstrap methods. Relying on the results of a companion paper for the kinematics and strong coupling spectrum, we consider various four-point functions in the planar limit, in an expansion for large 't Hooft coupling. Our ultimate goal is to provide a detailed derivation of the four-point function of the displacement supermultiplet at three loops, first presented in 2103.10440. Along the way, we present a large amount of new results including four-point functions with zero, one or two long external supermultiplets. The last two represent a novelty in the analytic bootstrap literature and are instrumental in addressing the problem of operators degeneracy. Such phenomenon leads to the necessity of resolving a mixing problem that is more complicated than those usually encountered in the study of holographic correlators, thus leading us to the development of a new approach that we believe will have a wider range of applicability. Related to this issue, we analyze in some detail the structure of the dilatation operator in this model. Some of the ingredients that we use apply more generally to holographic theories, although a thorough investigation of these aspects is missing, to the best of our knowledge, in most interesting cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of a new understanding of scattering amplitudes in the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory - based on combinatorial and geometric ideas in the kinematic space of scattering data. In this paper we report a surprise: far from the toy model it appears to be, the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes secretly contain the scattering amplitudes for pions, as well as non-supersymmetric gluons, in any number of dimensions. The amplitudes for the different theories are given by one and the same function, related by a simple shift of the kinematics. This discovery was spurred by another fundamental observation: the tree-level Tr$(\phi^3)$ field theory amplitudes have a hidden pattern of zeros when a special set of non-planar Mandelstam invariants is set to zero. Furthermore, near these zeros, the amplitudes simplify, by factoring into a non-trivial product of smaller amplitudes. Remarkably the amplitudes for pions and gluons are observed to also vanish in the same kinematical locus. These properties further generalize to the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes. There is a unique shift of the kinematic data that preserves the zeros, and this shift is precisely the one that unifies colored scalars, pions, and gluons into a single object. We will focus in this paper on explaining the hidden zeros and factorization properties and the connection between all the colored theories, working for simplicity at tree-level. Subsequent works will describe this new formulation for the Non-linear Sigma Model and non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, at all loop orders.</description>

Abstract: We use equivariant localization to construct off-shell entropy functions for supersymmetric black holes in $\mathcal{N}=2$, $D=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to matter. This allows one to compute the black hole entropy without solving the supergravity equations of motion and provides a novel generalization of the attractor mechanism. We consider magnetically charged black holes in $AdS_4$ which have an $AdS_2\times M_2$ near horizon geometry, where $M_2$ is a sphere or a spindle, and we also obtain entropy functions for ungauged supergravity as a simple corollary. We derive analogous results for black strings and rings in $D=5$ supergravity which have an $AdS_3\times M_2$ near horizon geometry, and in this setting we derive an off-shell expression for the central charge of the dual $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$, $d=2$~SCFT.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing the first example of an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear superpositions of single particle excitations in a scalar field theory on $AdS_3$ and evaluate their contribution to the bulk entanglement entropy across the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. We compare the entanglement entropy of these excitations obtained using the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula to the entanglement entropy of linear superposition of global descendants of a conformal primary in a large $c$ CFT obtained using the replica trick. We show that the closed from expressions for the entanglement entropy in the small interval expansion both in gravity and the CFT precisely agree. The agreement serves as a non-trivial check of the FLM formula for the quantum corrections to holographic entropy which also involves a contribution from the back reacted minimal area. Our checks includes an example in which the state is time dependent and spatially in-homogenous as well another example involving a coherent state with a Ba\~{n}ados geometry as its holographic dual.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new solution to the hierarchy (naturalness) problem, concerning quantum corrections of the Higgs mass. Assuming the Higgs boson as a system with a self-similar internal structure, we calculate its two-point function and find that the quadratic divergence is replaced by a logarithmic one in the mass corrections. It is shown that the partonic-like distribution follows the Tsallis statistics and also high energy physics experimental data for the Higgs transverse momentum distribution can be described by a self-similar statistical model.</description>

      <title>Anderson self-duality of topological modular forms, its differential-geometric manifestations, and vertex operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a morphism of spectra from $\mathrm{KO}((q))/\mathrm{TMF}$ to $\Sigma^{-20}I_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathrm{TMF}$, which we show to be an equivalence and to implement the Anderson self-duality of $\mathrm{TMF}$. This morphism is then used to define another morphism from $\mathrm{TMF}$ to $\Sigma^{-20}I_{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathrm{MSpin}/\mathrm{MString})$, which induces a differential geometric pairing and captures not only the invariant of Bunke and Naumann but also a finer invariant which detects subtle Anderson dual pairs of elements of $\pi_\bullet\mathrm{TMF}$. Our analysis leads to conjectures concerning certain self-dual vertex operator superalgebras and some specific torsion classes in $\pi_\bullet\mathrm{TMF}$.
  This paper is written as an article in mathematics, but much of the discussions in it was originally motivated by a study in heterotic string theory. As such, we have a separate appendix for physicists, in which the contents of the paper are summarized and translated into a language more amenable to them. In physics terms, our result allows us to compute the discrete part of the Green-Schwarz coupling of the $B$-field in a couple of subtle hitherto-unexplored cases.</description>

Abstract: We compute the complete set of two-loop master integrals for the scattering of four massless particles and a massive one. Our results are ready for phenomenological applications, removing a major obstacle to the computation of complete next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to processes such as the production of a $H/Z/W$ boson in association with two jets at the LHC. Furthermore, they open the door to new investigations into the structure of quantum-field theories and provide precious analytic data for studying the mathematical properties of Feynman integrals.</description>

Abstract: An effective field theory framework is used to investigate some Lorentz-violating effects on the generation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves, complementing previous work on propagation. Specifically we find solutions to a modified, anisotropic wave equation, sourced by charge or fluid matter. We derive the radiation fields for scalars, classical electromagnetic radiation, and partial results for gravitational radiation. For gravitational waves, the results show longitudinal and breathing polarizations proportional to coefficients for spacetime-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of a parent theory for general relativity and unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) and Unimodular Gravity (UG) provide two equivalent descriptions of gravity that differ in the nature of the cosmological constant. While GR is based on the group of diffeomorphisms that permits the cosmological constant in the action, UG is based on the subgroup of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms together with Weyl transformations which forbid the presence of the cosmological constant. However, the cosmological constant reappears in UG as an integration constant so it arises as a global degree of freedom. Since gauge symmetries are simply redundancies in our description of physical systems, a natural question is whether there exists a "parent theory" with the full diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformations as gauge symmetries so that it reduces to GR and UG respectively by performing suitable (partial) gauge fixings. We will explore this question by introducing Stueckelberg fields both in GR and UG to complete the gauge symmetries in each theory to that of the would-be parent theory. Despite the dynamical equivalence of the two theories, we find that precisely the additional global degree of freedom provided by the cosmological constant in UG obstructs the construction of the parent theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the SYK model -- an important toy model for quantum gravity on IBM's superconducting qubit quantum computers. By using a graph-coloring algorithm to minimize the number of commuting clusters of terms in the qubitized Hamiltonian, we find the gate complexity of the time evolution using the first-order product formula for $N$ Majorana fermions is $\mathcal{O}(N^5 J^{2}t^2/\epsilon)$ where $J$ is the dimensionful coupling parameter, $t$ is the evolution time, and $\epsilon$ is the desired precision. With this improved resource requirement, we perform the time evolution for $N=6, 8$ with maximum two-qubit circuit depth of 343. We perform different error mitigation schemes on the noisy hardware results and find good agreement with the exact diagonalization results on classical computers and noiseless simulators. In particular, we compute return probability after time $t$ and out-of-time order correlators (OTOC) which is a standard observable of quantifying the chaotic nature of quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles are predicted in many physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM). Their interactions with SM particles may arise from the triangle anomaly of the associated global symmetry, along with other SM global and gauge symmetries, including anomalies with the global baryon number and electromagnetic gauge symmetries. We initiate the phenomenological study of the corresponding ``electrobaryonic axion", a particle that couples with both the baryon chemical potential and the electromagnetic field. Neutron stars, particularly magnetars, possessing high baryon density and strong magnetic fields, can naturally develop a thin axion hair around their surface. In this study, we calculate this phenomenon, considering the effects of neutron star rotation and general relativity. For axion particles lighter than the neutron star rotation frequency, the anomalous interaction can also induce the emission of axion particles from the neutron star. This emission, in the light axion regime, can have a significant contribution to the neutron star cooling rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) II braneworld scenario, general relativity (GR) is modified by adding an extra dimension such that it is indistinguishable from GR in the weak gravity limit. However, such modifications may leave a mark in the strong field regime. We therefore analyze massive scalar perturbations around rotating black holes in the RS II model. Unlike black holes in GR, these braneworld black holes carry a tidal charge that contains information about the extra spatial dimension, and the rotation parameter for such black holes can exceed unity. Through the method of continued fractions, we investigate the quasinormal mode spectra, and the superradiant instabilities associated with the existence of quasibound states, that is, gravitational atoms. In comparison to the four-dimensional Kerr black hole, we report distinctive signatures of the tidal charge and the rotation parameter, which manifest as signals of the extra dimension, on both the fundamental quasinormal mode and the formation of gravitational atoms. These findings offer insights into testing modifications to GR and detecting ultralight bosonic particles around black holes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Metastable Cosmic String Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings appear in models of new physics with a two-step symmetry breaking $G\to H\to 1$, where $\pi_1(H)\neq 0$ and $\pi_1(G)=0$. They decay via the monopole-antimonopole pair creation inside. Conventionally, the breaking rate has been estimated by an infinitely thin string approximation, which requires a large hierarchy between the symmetry breaking scales. In this paper, we reexamine it by taking into account the finite sizes of both the cosmic string and the monopole. We obtain a robust lower limit on the tunneling factor $e^{-S_B}$ even for regimes the conventional estimate is unreliable. In particular, it is relevant to the cosmic string interpretation of the gravitational wave signals recently reported by pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from the Normalized Velocity Profile of Gaia Wide Binary Stars and Statistical Testing of Newtonian and Milgromian Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-acceleration gravitational anomaly is investigated with a new method of exploiting the normalized velocity profile $\tilde{v}\equiv v_p/v_c$ of wide binary stars as a function of the normalized sky-projected radius $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ where $v_p$ is the sky-projected relative velocity between the pair, $v_c$ is the Newtonian circular velocity at the sky-projected separation $s$, and $r_{\rm{M}}$ is the MOND radius. With a Monte Carlo method Gaia observed binaries and their virtual Newtonian counterparts are probabilistically distributed on the $s/r_{\rm{M}}$ versus $\tilde{v}$ plane and a logarithmic velocity ratio parameter $\Gamma$ is measured in the bins of $s/r_{\rm{M}}$. With three samples of binaries covering a broad range in size, data quality, and implied fraction of hierarchical systems including a new sample of 6389 binaries selected with accurate distances and radial velocities, I find a unanimous systematic variation from the Newtonian flat line. With $\Gamma=0$ at $s/r_{\rm{M}}\lesssim 0.15$ or $s\lesssim 1$~kilo astronomical units (kau), I get $\Gamma=0.068\pm 0.015$ (stat) $_{-0.015}^{+0.024}$ (syst) for $s/r_{\rm{M}} \gtrsim 0.7$ or $s\gtrsim 5$~kau. The gravitational anomaly (i.e.\ acceleration boost) factor given by $\gamma_g = 10^{2\Gamma}$ is measured to be $\gamma_g = 1.37_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$ (stat) $_{-0.09}^{+0.16}$ (syst). With a reduced $\chi^2$ test of Newtonian and Milgromian nonrelativistic theories, I find that Newtonian gravity is ruled out at $5.8\sigma$ ($\chi^2_\nu=9.4$) by the new sample (and $9.2\sigma$ by the largest sample used). The Milgromian AQUAL theory is acceptable with $0.5\lesssim \chi^2_\nu\lesssim 3.1$. These results agree well with earlier results with the ``acceleration-plane analysis'' for a variety of samples and the ``stacked velocity profile analysis'' for a pure binary sample.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Virtual Structure Constants and Generalizations of BCOV-Zinger Formula to Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Geometry of paraquaternionic contact structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of paraquaternionic contact structures (pqc structures), which turns out to be a generalization of the para 3-Sasakian geometry. We derive a distinguished linear connection preserving the pqc structure. Its torsion tensor is expressed explicitly in terms of the structure tensors and the structure equations of a pqc manifold are presented. We define pqc-Einstein manifolds and show that para 3-Sasakian spaces are precisely pqc manifolds, which are pqc-Einstein. Furthermore, we introduce the paraquaternionic Heisenberg qroup and show that it is the flat model of the pqc geometry.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated two models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in the ( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^- ) scattering process, employing cross-section calculations. We found that utilizing the dual electromagnetic tensor led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. However, in the other model the preservation of unitarity by the electromagnetic tensor in both scenarios implies its potential superiority, this implies promising prospects for this CPT and Lorentz symmetry-breaking model.</description>
