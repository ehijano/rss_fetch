      <title>rECGnition_v1.0: Arrhythmia detection using cardiologist-inspired multi-modal architecture incorporating demographic attributes in ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A substantial amount of variability in ECG manifested due to patient characteristics hinders the adoption of automated analysis algorithms in clinical practice. None of the ECG annotators developed till date consider the characteristics of the patients in a multi-modal architecture. We employed the XGBoost model to analyze the UCI Arrhythmia dataset, linking patient characteristics to ECG morphological changes. The model accurately classified patient gender using discriminative ECG features with 87.75% confidence. We propose a novel multi-modal methodology for ECG analysis and arrhythmia classification that can help defy the variability in ECG related to patient-specific conditions. This deep learning algorithm, named rECGnition_v1.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection Version 1), fuses Beat Morphology with Patient Characteristics to create a discriminative feature map that understands the internal correlation between both modalities. A Squeeze and Excitation based Patient characteristic Encoding Network (SEPcEnet) has been introduced, considering the patient's demographics. The trained model outperformed the various existing algorithms by achieving the overall F1-score of 0.986 for the ten arrhythmia class classification in the MITDB and achieved near perfect prediction scores of ~0.99 for LBBB, RBBB, Premature ventricular contraction beat, Atrial premature beat and Paced beat. Subsequently, the methodology was validated across INCARTDB, EDB and different class groups of MITDB using transfer learning. The generalizability test provided F1-scores of 0.980, 0.946, 0.977, and 0.980 for INCARTDB, EDB, MITDB AAMI, and MITDB Normal vs. Abnormal Classification, respectively. Therefore, with a more enhanced and comprehensive understanding of the patient being examined and their ECG for diverse CVD manifestations, the proposed rECGnition_v1.0 algorithm paves the way for its deployment in clinics.</description>

      <title>Distributed Blind Source Separation based on FastICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), many traditional signal processing tasks are required to be computed in a distributed fashion, without transmissions of the raw data to a centralized processing unit, due to the limited energy and bandwidth resources available to the sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which aims at identifying the original signal sources based on observations of their mixtures measured at various sensor nodes. One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.</description>

      <title>UbiHR: Resource-efficient Long-range Heart Rate Sensing on Ubiquitous Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ubiquitous on-device heart rate sensing is vital for high-stress individuals and chronic patients. Non-contact sensing, compared to contact-based tools, allows for natural user monitoring, potentially enabling more accurate and holistic data collection. However, in open and uncontrolled mobile environments, user movement and lighting introduce. Existing methods, such as curve-based or short-range deep learning recognition based on adjacent frames, strike the optimal balance between real-time performance and accuracy, especially under limited device resources. In this paper, we present UbiHR, a ubiquitous device-based heart rate sensing system. Key to UbiHR is a real-time long-range spatio-temporal model enabling noise-independent heart rate recognition and display on commodity mobile devices, along with a set of mechanisms for prompt and energy-efficient sampling and preprocessing. Diverse experiments and user studies involving four devices, four tasks, and 80 participants demonstrate UbiHR's superior performance, enhancing accuracy by up to 74.2\% and reducing latency by 51.2\%.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Design and Satellite Selection for Integrated Communication and Navigation in LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relying on the powerful communication capabilities and rapidly changing geometric configuration, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have the potential to offer integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) services. However, the isolated resource utilization in the traditional satellite communication and navigation systems has led to a compromised system performance. Against this backdrop, this paper formulates a joint beamforming design and satellite selection optimization problem for the LEO-ICAN network to maximize the sum rate, while simultaneously reconciling the positioning performance. A two-layer algorithm is proposed, where the beamforming design in the inner layer is solved by the difference-of-convex programming method to maximize the sum rate, and the satellite selection in the outer layer is modeled as a coalition formation game to simultaneously reconcile the positioning performance. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed algorithms by increasing the sum rate by 16.6% and 29.3% compared with the conventional beamforming and satellite selection schemes, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Modulo Sampling Hardware Prototype and Reconstruction Algorithm Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a vital important role in any devices via manipulating analog signals in a digital manner. Given that the amplitude of the signal exceeds the dynamic range of the ADCs, clipping occurs and the quality of the digitized signal degrades significantly. In this paper, we design a joint modulo sampling hardware and processing prototype which improves the ADCs' dynamic range by folding the signal before sampling. Both the detailed design of the hardware and the recovery results of various state-of-the-art processing algorithms including our proposed unlimited sampling line spectral estimation (USLSE) algorithm are presented. Additionally, key issues that arise during implementation are also addressed. It is demonstrated that the USLSE algorithm successfully recovers the original signal with a frequency of 2.5 kHz and an amplitude 10 times the ADC's dynamic range, and the linear prediction (LP) algorithm successfully recovers the original signal with a frequency of 3.5 kHz and an amplitude 10 times the ADC's dynamic range.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Deep Learning for Precise Indoor Positioning in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate localization in indoor environments is a challenge due to the Non Line of Sight (NLoS) nature of the signaling. In this paper, we explore the use of AI/ML techniques for positioning accuracy enhancement in Indoor Factory (InF) scenarios. The proposed neural network, which we term LocNet, is trained on measurements such as Channel Impulse Response (CIR) and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) from multiple Transmit Receive Points (TRPs). Simulation results show that when using measurements from 18 TRPs, LocNet achieves a 9 cm positioning accuracy at the 90th percentile. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model generalizes effectively even when measurements from some TRPs randomly become unavailable. Lastly, we provide insights on the robustness of the trained model to the errors in ground truth labels used for training.</description>

      <title>How Critical is Site-Specific RAN Optimization? 5G Open-RAN Uplink Air Interface Performance Test and Optimization from Macro-Cell CIR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the importance of channel measurement data from specific sites and its impact on air interface optimization and test. Currently, a range of statistical channel models including 3GPP 38.901 tapped delay line (TDL), clustered delay line (CDL), urban microcells (UMi) and urban macrocells (UMa) type channels are widely used for air interface performance testing and simulation. However, there remains a gap in the realism of these models for air interface testing and optimization when compared with real world measurement based channels. To address this gap, we compare the performance impacts of training neural receivers with 1) statistical 3GPP TDL models, and 2) measured macro-cell channel impulse response (CIR) data. We leverage our OmniPHY-5G neural receiver for NR PUSCH uplink simulation, with a training procedure that uses statistical TDL channel models for pre-training, and fine-tuning based on measured site specific MIMO CIR data. The proposed fine-tuning method achieves a 10% block error rate (BLER) at a 1.85 dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to pre-training only on simulated TDL channels, illustrating a rough magnitude of the gap that can be closed by site-specific training, and gives the first answer to the question "how much can fine-tuning the RAN for site-specific channels help?"</description>

      <title>SDR-Based Metal Classification using Spectrogram Images from Micro-Doppler Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic materials such as brass, copper, and aluminum are used in numerous applications, including industrial manufacturing. The vibration characteristics of these objects are unique and can be used to identify these objects from a distance. This research presents a methodology for detecting and classifying these metallic objects using the vibration dynamics induced by their micro-Doppler signatures. The proposed approach utilizes image processing techniques to extract pivotal features from spectrograms. These spectrograms originate from micro-Doppler signatures of data collected during controlled laboratory experiments where signals were transmitted towards vibrating metal sheets, and the ensuing reflections were recorded using a software-defined radio (SDR). The spectrogram data was augmented using geometric transformation to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based machine learning model for object classification. The results indicate that the proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of more than 95% in classifying metals into brass, copper, and aluminum. This research could be used to understand the foundations of classifying spectrogram images using micro-Doppler signatures for its applications towards enhancing the sensing capabilities in industrial and defense applications.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Multiscale State-Space Modeling with Nested Nonlinear Dynamics: An Application to Bayesian Learning under Switching Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>

      <title>Equitable Federated Learning with Activation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a prominent distributed learning paradigm that incorporates collaboration among diverse clients, promotes data locality, and thus ensures privacy. These clients have their own technological, cultural, and other biases in the process of data generation. However, the present standard often ignores this bias/heterogeneity, perpetuating bias against certain groups rather than mitigating it. In response to this concern, we propose an equitable clustering-based framework where the clients are categorized/clustered based on how similar they are to each other. We propose a unique way to construct the similarity matrix that uses activation vectors. Furthermore, we propose a client weighing mechanism to ensure that each cluster receives equal importance and establish $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate of convergence to reach an $\epsilon-$stationary solution. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed strategy against common baselines, demonstrating its efficacy in terms of reducing the bias existing amongst various client clusters and consequently ameliorating algorithmic bias against specific groups.</description>

      <title>Joint User Scheduling and Precoding for RIS-Aided MU-MISO Systems: A MADRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted massive attention due to its low-cost and capability of controlling wireless environment. However, there is still a lack of treatments to deal with the growth of the number of users and RIS elements, which may incur performance degradation or computational complexity explosion. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization of user scheduling and precoding for distributed RIS-aided communication systems. Firstly, we propose an optimization-based numerical method to obtain suboptimal solutions with the aid of the approximation of ergodic sum rate. Secondly, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the high dimensionality, we propose a data-driven scalable and generalizable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with the aim to maximize the ergodic sum rate approximation through the cooperation of all agents. Further, we propose a novel dynamic working process exploiting the trained MADRL algorithm, which enables distributed RISs to configure their own passive precoding independently. Simulation results show that our algorithm substantially reduces the computational complexity by a time reduction of three orders of magnitude at the cost of 3% performance degradation, compared with the optimization-based method, and achieves 6% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms.</description>

      <title>A potpourri of results on molecular communication with active transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a model of information transmission where the signal is transmitted by information-carrying molecules through their physical transport from a transmitter to a receiver through a communication channel. Prior efforts have identified suitable "information molecules" whose efficacy for signal transmission has been studied extensively in diffusive channels (DC). Although easy to implement, DCs are inefficient for distances longer than tens of nanometers. In contrast, molecular motor-driven nonequilibrium or active transport can drastically increase the range of communication and may permit efficient communication up to tens of micrometers. In this paper, we investigate how active transport influences the efficacy of molecular communication, quantified by the mutual information between transmitted and received signals. We consider two specific scenarios: (a) active transport through relays and (b) active transport through a mixture of active and diffusing particles. In each case, we discuss the efficacy of the communication channel and discuss their potential pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Integration of Communication and Computational Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication enables the expansion of human visual perception beyond the limitations of time and distance, while computational imaging overcomes the constraints of depth and breadth. Although impressive achievements have been witnessed with the two types of technologies, the occlusive information flow between the two domains is a bottleneck hindering their ulterior progression. Herein, we propose a novel framework that integrates communication and computational imaging (ICCI) to break through the inherent isolation between communication and computational imaging for remote perception. By jointly considering the sensing and transmitting of remote visual information, the ICCI framework performs a full-link information transfer optimization, aiming to minimize information loss from the generation of the information source to the execution of the final vision tasks. We conduct numerical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the ICCI framework by integrating communication systems and snapshot compressive imaging systems. Compared with straightforward combination schemes, which sequentially execute sensing and transmitting, the ICCI scheme shows greater robustness against channel noise and impairments while achieving higher data compression. Moreover, an 80 km 27-band hyperspectral video perception with a rate of 30 fps is experimentally achieved. This new ICCI remote perception paradigm offers a highefficiency solution for various real-time computer vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: a Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>

      <title>Connecting Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with Contrastive Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent advancements in unsupervised visual representation learning, the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a significant method for extracting visual features from unlabeled imagery through an innovative masking strategy. Despite its success, two primary limitations have been identified: the inefficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from I-JEPA in preventing entire collapse and the inadequacy of I-JEPA prediction in accurately learning the mean of patch representations. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework, namely C-JEPA (Contrastive-JEPA), which integrates the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) strategy. This integration is designed to effectively learn the variance/covariance for preventing entire collapse and ensuring invariance in the mean of augmented views, thereby overcoming the identified limitations. Through empirical and theoretical evaluations, our work demonstrates that C-JEPA significantly enhances the stability and quality of visual representation learning. When pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, C-JEPA exhibits rapid and improved convergence in both linear probing and fine-tuning performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical Dynamics of the Heart: A Study of Cardiac Hysteresis During Physical Stress Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.
  Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.
  Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.
  Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An amplifier-less continuous-time analog-to-digital converter consisting of only passives, comparators, and inverters is presented. Beyond simplicity, the architecture displays significant robustness properties with respect to component variations and comparator input offsets. We give an analytical design procedure demonstrating how to parameterize the architecture to a range of signal-to-noise and bandwidth requirements and validate the procedure's accuracy with behavioral transient simulations.</description>

      <title>A Rainbow in Deep Network Black Boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central question in deep learning is to understand the functions learned by deep networks. What is their approximation class? Do the learned weights and representations depend on initialization? Previous empirical work has evidenced that kernels defined by network activations are similar across initializations. For shallow networks, this has been theoretically studied with random feature models, but an extension to deep networks has remained elusive. Here, we provide a deep extension of such random feature models, which we call the rainbow model. We prove that rainbow networks define deterministic (hierarchical) kernels in the infinite-width limit. The resulting functions thus belong to a data-dependent RKHS which does not depend on the weight randomness. We also verify numerically our modeling assumptions on deep CNNs trained on image classification tasks, and show that the trained networks approximately satisfy the rainbow hypothesis. In particular, rainbow networks sampled from the corresponding random feature model achieve similar performance as the trained networks. Our results highlight the central role played by the covariances of network weights at each layer, which are observed to be low-rank as a result of feature learning.</description>

      <title>PolyCLEAN: Atomic Optimization for Super-Resolution Imaging and Uncertainty Estimation in Radio Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: We address two issues for the adoption of convex optimization in radio interferometric imaging. First, a method for a fine resolution setup is proposed which scales naturally in terms of memory usage and reconstruction speed. Second, a new tool to localize a region of uncertainty is developed, paving the way for quantitative imaging in radio interferometry.
  Methods: The classical $\ell_1$ penalty is used to turn the inverse problem into a sparsity-promoting optimization. For efficient implementation, the so-called Frank-Wolfe algorithm is used together with a \textit{polyatomic} refinement. The algorithm naturally produces sparse images at each iteration, leveraged to reduce memory and computational requirements. In that regard, PolyCLEAN reproduces the numerical behavior of CLEAN while guaranteeing that it solves the minimization problem of interest. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the \textit{dual certificate image}, which appears as a numerical byproduct of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This image is proposed as a tool for uncertainty quantification on the location of the recovered sources.
  Results: PolyCLEAN demonstrates good scalability performance, in particular for fine-resolution grids. On simulations, the Python-based implementation is competitive with the fast numerically-optimized CLEAN solver. This acceleration does not affect image reconstruction quality: PolyCLEAN images are consistent with CLEAN-obtained ones for both point sources and diffuse emission recovery. We also highlight PolyCLEAN reconstruction capabilities on observed radio measurements.
  Conclusions: PolyCLEAN can be considered as an alternative to CLEAN in the radio interferometric imaging pipeline, as it enables the use of Bayesian priors without impacting the scalability and numerical performance of the imaging method.</description>

      <title>MIMO Precoding for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the strong atom-light interaction, a Rydberg atomic receiver can measure radio waves with extreme sensitivity. Existing research primarily focuses on improving the signal detection capability of atomic receivers, while traditional signal processing schemes at the transmitter side have remained unchanged. As a result, these schemes fail to maximize the throughput of atomic receivers, given that the coupling between atomic dipole moment and radio-wave magnitude results in a nonlinear transmission model in contrast to the traditional linear one. To address this issue, our work proposes to design customized precoding techniques for atomic multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems to achieve the channel capacity. A strong-reference approximation is initially proposed to linearize the nonlinear transition model of atomic receivers. This facilitates the derivation of atomic-MIMO channel capacity as $\min(N_r/2, N_t)\log({\rm SNR})$ at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for $N_r$ receive atomic antennas and $N_t$ classic transmit antennas. Then, a new digital precoding technique, termed In-phase-and-Quadrature (IQ) aware precoding is presented, which features independent processing of I/Q data streams using four real-valued matrices. The design is shown to be capacity-achieving for the atomic MIMO system. In addition, for the case of large-scale MIMO system, we extend the preceding fully-digital precoding design to the popular hybrid precoding architecture, which cascades a classical analog precoder with a low-dimensional version of the proposed IQ-aware digital precoder. By alternatively optimizing the digital and analog parts, the hybrid design is able to approach the performance of the optimal IQ-aware fully digital precoding. Simulation results validate the superiority of proposed IQ-aware precoding methods over existing techniques in the context of atomic MIMO communication.</description>
