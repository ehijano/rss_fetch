      <title>Matrix concentration inequalities for dependent binary random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Bernstein-type matrix concentration inequalities for linear combinations with matrix coefficients of binary random variables satisfying certain $\ell_\infty$-independence assumptions, complementing recent results by Kaufman, Kyng and Solda. For random variables with the Stochastic Covering Property or Strong Rayleigh Property we prove estimates for general functions satisfying certain direction aware matrix bounded difference inequalities, generalizing and strengthening earlier estimates by the first-named author and Polaczyk.
  We also demonstrate a general decoupling inequality for a class of Banach-space valued quadratic forms in negatively associated random variables and combine it with the matrix Bernstein inequality to generalize results by Tropp, Chr\'etien and Darses, and Ruetz and Schnass, concerning the operator norm of a random submatrix of a deterministic matrix, drawn by uniform sampling without replacements or rejective sampling, to submatrices given by general Strong Rayleigh sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>$\chi$-Boundedness and Neighbourhood Complexity of Bounded Merge-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merge-width, recently introduced by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, is a common generalisation of bounded expansion classes and twin-width for which the first-order model checking problem remains tractable. We prove that a number of basic properties shared by bounded expansion and bounded twin-width graphs also hold for bounded merge-width graphs: they are $\chi$-bounded, they satisfy the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property, and their neighbourhood complexity is linear.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>WalkSAT is linear on random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an influential article Papadimitriou [FOCS 1991] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with $n$ variables in $O(n^2)$ expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos and St\"utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SICOMP 2007], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT satisfiability threshold.</description>
