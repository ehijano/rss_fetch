      <title>3D E-textile for Exercise Physiology and Clinical Maternal Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic textiles (E-textiles) offer great wearing comfort and unobtrusiveness, thus holding potential for next-generation health monitoring wearables. However, the practical implementation is hampered by challenges associated with poor signal quality, substantial motion artifacts, durability for long-term usage, and non-ideal user experience. Here, we report a cost-effective E-textile system that features 3D microfiber-based electrodes for greatly increasing the surface area. The soft and fluffy conductive microfibers disperse freely and securely adhere to the skin, achieving a low impedance at the electrode-skin interface even in the absence of gel. A superhydrophobic fluorinated self-assembled monolayer was deposited on the E-textile surface to render it waterproof while retaining the electrical conductivity. Equipped with a custom-designed motion-artifact canceling wireless data recording circuit, the E-textile system could be integrated into a variety of smart garments for exercise physiology and health monitoring applications. Real-time multimodal electrophysiological signal monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), was successfully carried out during strenuous cycling and even underwater swimming activities. Furthermore, a multi-channel E-textile was developed and implemented in clinical patient studies for simultaneous real-time monitoring of maternal ECG and uterine EMG signals, incorporating spatial-temporal potential mapping capabilities.</description>

      <title>Latent Spaces Enable Transformer-Based Dose Prediction in Complex Radiotherapy Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence is accumulating in favour of using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) to treat multiple cancer lesions in the lung. Multi-lesion lung SABR plans are complex and require significant resources to create. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage latent transformer framework (LDFormer) for dose prediction of lung SABR plans with varying numbers of lesions. In the first stage, patient anatomical information and the dose distribution are encoded into a latent space. In the second stage, a transformer learns to predict the dose latent from the anatomical latents. Causal attention is modified to adapt to different numbers of lesions. LDFormer outperforms a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network on dose conformality in and around lesions, and the performance gap widens when considering overlapping lesions. LDFormer generates predictions of 3-D dose distributions in under 30s on consumer hardware, and has the potential to assist physicians with clinical decision making, reduce resource costs, and accelerate treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about the polarization of annihilation photons is not available. Current PET systems track molecules labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes by detecting the propagation direction of two photons from positron-electron annihilation. However, annihilation photons carry more information than just the site where they originated. Here we present a novel J-PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, in which annihilation photons interact predominantly via the Compton effect, providing information about photon polarization in addition to information on photon direction of propagation. Theoretically, photons from the decay of positronium in a vacuum are maximally entangled in polarization. However, in matter, when the positron from positronium annihilates with the electron bound to the atom, the question arises whether the photons from such annihilation are maximally entangled. In this work, we determine the distribution of the relative angle between polarization orientations of two photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. Contrary to prior results for positron annihilation in aluminum and copper, where the strength of observed correlations is as expected for maximally entangled photons, our results show a significant deviation. We demonstrate that in porous polymer, photon polarization correlation is weaker than for maximally entangled photons but stronger than for separable photons. The data indicate that more than 40% of annihilations in Amberlite resin lead to a non-maximally entangled state. Our result indicates the degree of correlation depends on the annihilation mechanism and the molecular arrangement. We anticipate that the introduced Compton interaction-based PET system opens a promising perspective for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a novel diagnostic indicator.</description>

      <title>SPOCKMIP: Segmentation of Vessels in MRAs with Enhanced Continuity using Maximum Intensity Projection as Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of vessel structures of different sizes in biomedical images is crucial in the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the sparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel segmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment vessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations and the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised patch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one to two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation quality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the Maximum Intensity Projection~(MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the single~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed MIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which is evident in visual examinations of ROIs. Patch-based training is improved by introducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted discontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the StudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight~(ToF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. The generalisation performance of the method is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is observed that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better quality segmentations with a median Dice of $80.245 \pm 0.129$. Also, the method with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of $79.749 \pm 0.109$. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the predicted segmentation reveals a significant improvement in the continuity of the vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Improved Calibrationless Radial MRI with NLINV-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a neural network architecture for improved calibrationless reconstruction of radial data when no ground truth is available for training. Methods: NLINV-Net is a model-based neural network architecture that directly estimates images and coil sensitivities from (radial) k-space data via non-linear inversion (NLINV). Combined with a training strategy using self-supervision via data undersampling (SSDU), it can be used for imaging problems where no ground truth reconstructions are available. We validated the method for (1) real-time cardiac imaging and (2) single-shot subspace-based quantitative T1 mapping. Furthermore, region-optimized virtual (ROVir) coils were used to suppress artifacts stemming from outside the FoV and to focus the k-space based SSDU loss on the region of interest. NLINV-Net based reconstructions were compared with conventional NLINV and PI-CS (parallel imaging + compressed sensing) reconstruction and the effect of the region-optimized virtual coils and the type of training loss was evaluated qualitatively. Results: NLINV-Net based reconstructions contain significantly less noise than the NLINV-based counterpart. ROVir coils effectively suppress streakings which are not suppressed by the neural networks while the ROVir-based focussed loss leads to visually sharper time series for the movement of the myocardial wall in cardiac real-time imaging. For quantitative imaging, T1-maps reconstructed using NLINV-Net show similar quality as PI-CS reconstructions, but NLINV-Net does not require slice-specific tuning of the regularization parameter. Conclusion: NLINV-Net is a versatile tool for calibrationless imaging which can be used in challenging imaging scenarios where a ground truth is not available.</description>

      <title>Functional Assessment of Cerebral Capillaries using Single Capillary Reporters in Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>

Abstract: The brain's microvascular cerebral capillary network plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health, yet capillary dynamics are still not well understood due to limitations in existing imaging techniques. Here, we present Single Capillary Reporters (SCaRe) for transcranial Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), a novel approach enabling non-invasive, whole-brain mapping of single capillaries and estimates of their transit-time as a neurovascular biomarker. We accomplish this first through computational Monte Carlo and ultrasound simulations of microbubbles flowing through a fully-connected capillary network. We unveil distinct capillary flow behaviors which informs methodological changes to ULM acquisitions to better capture capillaries in vivo. Subsequently, applying SCaRe-ULM in vivo, we achieve unprecedented visualization of single capillary tracks across brain regions, analysis of layer-specific capillary heterogeneous transit times (CHT), and characterization of whole microbubble trajectories from arterioles to venules. Lastly, we evaluate capillary biomarkers using injected lipopolysaccharide to induce systemic neuroinflammation and track the increase in SCaRe-ULM CHT, demonstrating the capability to detect subtle capillary functional changes. SCaRe-ULM represents a significant advance in studying microvascular dynamics, offering novel avenues for investigating capillary patterns in neurological disorders and potential diagnostic applications.</description>
