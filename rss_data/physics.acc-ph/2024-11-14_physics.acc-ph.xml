      <title>HTS Undulator Design Study and First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undulators are X-ray sources that are widely utilised in advanced synchrotron radiation sources and freeelectron laser facilities. Due to sustainability and energy efficiency, the development focuses on small-scale, high-field, and especially compact undulators with short period lengths ($\leq$ 10 mm) and narrow magnetic gaps ($\leq$ 4 mm). Therefore, hightemperature superconducting (HTS) tapes, which can provide a high critical current density and high critical magnetic fields at higher temperatures, are extensively used and investigated at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A new concept of superconducting undulators (SCUs) was introduced and further developed by laser-scribing a meander pattern into the superconducting layer to achieve a quasi-sinusoidal current path through the HTS tape. Here we present the complete and final design of such a compact SCU, in particular our latest results regarding the design of the liner with its tapering in the warm region, as well as the cryogenic cooling concept.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the emittance of accelerated electron bunches at the AWAKE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical plane transverse emittance of accelerated electron bunches at the AWAKE experiment at CERN has been determined, using three different methods of data analysis. This is a proof-of-principle measurement using the existing AWAKE electron spectrometer to validate the measurement technique. Large values of the geometric emittance, compared to that of the injection beam, are observed ($\sim \SI{0.5}{\milli\metre\milli\radian}$ compared with $\sim \SI{0.08}{\milli\metre\milli\radian}$), which is in line with expectations of emittance growth arising from plasma density ramps and large injection beam bunch size. Future iterations of AWAKE are anticipated to operate in conditions where emittance growth is better controlled, and the effects of the imaging systems of the existing and future spectrometer designs on the ability to measure the emittance are discussed. Good performance of the instrument down to geometric emittances of approximately $\SI{1e-4}{\milli\metre\milli\radian}$ is required, which may be possible with improved electron optics and imaging.</description>

      <title>Design of a resonant slow extraction from low emittance electron booster rings using transverse resonance island buckets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we present the design of a resonant slow extraction based on the radio frequency knock-out (RF-KO) scheme, where we make use of the transverse resonance islands bucket (TRIB) optics. The generation of the TRIB optics is presented in two example lattices, that are considered for the potential upgrade of the current booster at DESY. The slow extraction would potentially supply high energy electron beams to the HEP beamline users. Simulations show an extraction efficiency in excess of 90% with a septum blade thickness of \SI{100}{\micro\meter}.</description>

      <title>Planar channeling of 855 MeV electrons in a boron-doped (110) diamond undulator -- a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 4-period diamond undulator with a thickness of 20 $\mu$m was produced with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), applying boron doping, on a straight diamond crystal with an effective thickness of 165.5 $\mu$m. A planar (110) channeling experiment was performed with the 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility to observe the expected undulator peak. The search was guided by simulation calculations on a personal computer. The code is based on the continuum potential picture, and a classical electrodynamic expression which involves explicitly the acceleration of the particle. As a result, an unexpected optimal observation angle was figured out, for which the undulator peak is strongest and the channeling radiation from the backing crystal being significantly suppressed. However, an undulator peak was not observed. Implications for the prepared undulator structure are discussed.
  Scatter distributions were measured for a 75 $\mu$m Kapton, a 25 $\mu$m aluminum foils, and a 70.7 $\mu$m diamond plate in random orientation. The results were compared with Moli\`ere's scatter theory for amorphous medii. Very good agreement was found for Kapton and aluminum while for diamond the experimental width is 21\% smaller. This reduction is interpreted as coherent scattering suppression in single crystals. At tilted injection of the beam with respect to the (110) plane a clear asymmetry was observed which resembles partial beam deflection. We interpret this phenomenon heuristically as re-channeling.</description>

      <title>SRF programs towards High-Q/High-G cavities in IJCLab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IJCLab has been leading the development and deployment of low-$\beta$ Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities for proton and heavy ion accelerators. We are launching an electron accelerator project for sustainable Energy Recovery Linac (iSAS/PERLE) with state-of-the-art SRF cavities at 800~MHz. Our proposal includes advanced heat treatment of such cavities to reach an excellent quality factor of $3\times 10^{10}$ at $22$~MV/m. In this paper, we overview the status of this activity.</description>
