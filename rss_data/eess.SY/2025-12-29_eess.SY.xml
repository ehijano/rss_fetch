      <title>Inter-seasonal and multi-objective optimization of a sustainable hydrogen supply chain in Corsica integrating water availability constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier for mobility applications in island territories, which are traditionally dependent on fossil fuel imports. Green hydrogen is identified as a key component of the energy transition. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with a multi-period, multi-objective framework is used to optimize the hydrogen supply chain based on system costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and a risk index. The model incorporates critical island-specific factors such as water resource availability, renewable energy sources, tourism flow, and geographic constraints. A multi-criteria decision making tool based on a modified version of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) aids the identification of optimal solutions. Results suggest a decentralized Hydrogen Supply Chains (HSC) structure with minimized transport. The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) is estimated at 6.54 ___/kg, and GHG emissions range from 1.32 to 1.75 kgCO 2 e/kg H 2. This study highlights the impact of tourism on energy demand and the crucial role of water resources, offering a novel approach to optimizing island-specific HSC.</description>

      <title>EcoNet: Multiagent Planning and Control Of Household Energy Resources Using Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences. Simulation results are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Day Scheduling for Electric Vehicle Routing: A Novel Model and Comparison Of Metaheuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) requires efficient route planning solutions that take into account the limited range of EVs and the associated charging times, as well as the different types of charging stations. In this work, we model and solve an electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) designed for a cross-platform navigation system for individual transport. The aim is to provide users with an efficient route for their daily appointments and to reduce possible inconveniences caused by charging their EV. Based on these assumptions, we propose a multi-day model in the form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that takes into account the vehicle's battery capacity and the time windows of user's appointments.
  The model is solved using various established metaheuristics, including tabu search (TS), adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the performance of the individual approaches is analyzed using generated ensembles to estimate their behavior in reality and is compared with the exact results of the Google OR-Tools solver.</description>

      <title>An Equivalent and Unified Virtual Battery Modeling Framework for Flexibility Characterization of Building HVAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system dominates building's energy consumption and meanwhile exhibits substantial operational flexibility that can be exploited for providing grid services. However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedded systems are becoming more in demand to work in dynamic and uncertain environments, and being confined to the strong requirements of real-time. Conventional static scheduling models usually cannot cope with runtime modification in workload, resource availability, or system updates. This brief survey covers the area of feedback-based control (e.g., Feedback Control Scheduling) and interdependence between tasks (e.g., Symbiotic Scheduling of Periodic Tasks) models. It also borders on predictive methods and power management, combining methods based on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). In this paper, key mechanisms are briefly summarized, influencing trade-offs relating to adaptivity/predictability, typical metrics of evaluation, and ongoing problems, especially in situations where safety is a critical factor, giving a succinct and easy-to-understand introduction to researchers and practitioners who have to cope with the changing environment of adaptive real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Lyapunov-based Deep Neural Networks (Lb-DNNs) have demonstrated improved performance over shallow NNs and traditional adaptive control for nonlinear systems with uncertain dynamics. Existing Lb-DNNs rely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which lack interpretable insights. As a first step towards embedding interpretable insights in the control architecture, this paper develops the first Lyapunov-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Lb-KAN) adaptive control method for uncertain nonlinear systems. Unlike MLPs with deep-layer matrix multiplications, KANs provide interpretable insights by direct functional decomposition. In this framework, KANs are employed to approximate uncertain dynamics and embedded into the control law, enabling visualizable functional decomposition. The analytical update laws are constructed from a Lyapunov-based analysis for real-time learning without prior data in a KAN architecture. The analysis uses the distinct KAN approximation theorem to formally bound the reconstruction error and its effect on the performance. The update law is derived by incorporating the KAN's learnable parameters into a Jacobian matrix, enabling stable, analytical, real-time adaptation and ensuring asymptotic convergence of tracking errors. Moreover, the Lb-KAN provides a foundation for interpretability characteristics by achieving visualizable functional decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that the Lb-KAN controller reduces the function approximation error by 20.2% and 18.0% over the baseline Lb-LSTM and Lb-DNN methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning-Based Formula 1 Race Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two complementary frameworks to optimize Formula 1 race strategies, jointly accounting for energy allocation, tire wear and pit stop timing. First, the race scenario is modeled using lap time maps and a dynamic tire wear model capturing the main trade-offs arising during a race. Then, we solve the problem by means of a mixed-integer nonlinear program that handles the integer nature of the pit stop decisions. The same race scenario is embedded into a reinforcement learning environment, on which an agent is trained. Providing fast inference at runtime, this method is suited to improve human decision-making during real races. The learned policy's suboptimality is assessed with respect to the optimal solution, both in a nominal scenario and with an unforeseen disturbance. In both cases, the agent achieves approximately 5s of suboptimality on 1.5h of race time, mainly attributable to the different energy allocation strategy. This work lays the foundations for learning-based race strategies and provides a benchmark for future developments.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Averaging on Dynamic Graphs with Selective Neighborhood Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time consensus model in which agents iteratively update their states through interactions on a dynamic social network. At each step, a single agent is selected asynchronously and averages the values of its current neighbors. A distinctive feature of our model is that an agent's neighborhood may contract following an update, while non-selected agents may add or remove neighbors independently. This creates a time-varying communication structure with endogenous contraction. We show that under mild assumptions--specifically, that the evolving graph is connected infinitely often--the system reaches consensus almost surely. Our results extend classical consensus theory on time-varying graphs and asynchronous updates by introducing selective neighborhood contraction, offering new insights into agreement dynamics in evolving social systems.</description>

      <title>Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Placement of Data Centers to Support Power Distribution Networks Using Intelligent Algorithms with Economic Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are among the fastest growing electricity consumers and can impose severe voltage drops and feeder losses when connected to weak distribution networks. This paper formulates a techno economic siting problem in which each candidate data center site is mapped to a bus of the distribution network and is assumed to deploy on site renewable generation and power electronic interfaces, resulting in a controllable net active power injection equivalent to distributed generation. A mixed integer nonlinear optimization model is developed to jointly select the connection bus and size the DG capacity while respecting network operating limits. The objective combines three normalized terms including active power losses, a voltage deviation index capturing profile quality, and investment cost derived from location dependent land price and unit DG cost. To address the discrete continuous search space, an intelligent genetic algorithm is embedded in a multi scenario decision framework with adaptive weight tuning. Three stakeholder scenarios prioritize losses, voltage quality, or techno economic balance, and additional balanced scenarios are generated automatically until the optimal bus decision converges. A case study on the IEEE 33 bus radial system demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The converged design selects bus 14 with 1.10 MW DG, reducing total losses from 202.67 kW to 129.37 kW while improving the minimum bus voltage to 0.933 per unit at a moderate investment cost of 1.33 MUSD. The proposed framework provides an interpretable pathway to integrate economic indicators into distribution aware data center siting.</description>

      <title>From Visual Perception to Deep Empathy: An Automated Assessment Framework for House-Tree-Person Drawings Using Multimodal LLMs and Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

      <title>Safe Path Planning and Observation Quality Enhancement Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Water Quality Monitoring Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Freshness-Aware Wireless Networking with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has become a central measure of data freshness in modern wireless systems, yet existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or provide broad discussions of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem. Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Natural Power Method and Its Applications to Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the discrete-time natural power method, demonstrating its convergence to the dominant $r$-dimensional subspace corresponding to the $r$ eigenvalues with the largest absolute values. This contrasts with the Oja flow, which targets eigenvalues with the largest real parts. We leverage this property to develop methods for model order reduction and low-rank controller synthesis for discrete-time LTI systems, proving preservation of key system properties. We also extend the low-rank control framework to slowly-varying LTV systems, showing its utility for tracking time-varying dominant subspaces.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Task in Uncertain Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Cooperative Strategies in Search Engine Advertising Market: With and Without Retail Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In search engine advertising (SEA) market, where competition among retailers is intense and multifaceted, channel coordination between retailers and manufacturers emerges as a critical factor, which significantly influences the effectiveness of advertising strategies. This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market.</description>

      <title>Smart IoT-Based Leak Forecasting and Detection for Energy-Efficient Liquid Cooling in AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trajectory Planning for Orbital Robot Rendezvous and Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approaching a tumbling target safely is a critical challenge in space debris removal missions utilizing robotic manipulators onboard servicing satellites. In this work, we propose a trajectory planning method based on nonlinear optimization for a close-range rendezvous to bring a free-floating, rotating debris object in a two-dimensional plane into the manipulator's workspace, as a preliminary step for its capture. The proposed method introduces a dynamic keep-out sphere that adapts depending on the approach conditions, allowing for closer and safer access to the target. Furthermore, a control strategy is developed to reproduce the optimized trajectory using discrete ON/OFF thrusters, considering practical implementation constraints.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06793v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. In particular, privacy noises are incorporated into each agent's state and tracking variable to mitigate information leakage, after which the perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes for the step-sizes and the sampling number within the algorithm. The sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method employed by both schemes enhances the differential privacy level, and ensures a finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The algorithm achieves both almost sure and mean square convergence for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, when nonconvex objectives satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, Scheme (S1) achieves a polynomial mean square convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves an exponential mean square convergence rate. The trade-off between privacy and convergence is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing works are illustrated through numerical examples of distributed training on the benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".</description>

      <title>Client-Aided Secure Two-Party Computation of Dynamic Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a secure two-party computation protocol for dynamic controllers using a secret sharing scheme. The proposed protocol realizes outsourcing of controller computation to two servers, while controller parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are kept secret against the servers. Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity. The feasibility of the protocol is demonstrated through numerical examples of PID and observer-based controls.</description>

      <title>Planar Juggling of a Devil-Stick using Discrete VHCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planar juggling of a devil-stick using impulsive inputs is addressed using the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC). The location of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation at the discrete instants when impulsive control inputs are applied. The discrete zero dynamics (DZD) resulting from the choice of DVHC provides conditions for stable juggling. A control design that enforces the DVHC and an orbit stabilizing controller are presented. The approach is validated in simulation.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Pyranometer-Based ANN Approach for MPPT in Solar PV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors. The proposed approach integrates pyranometers, temperature sensors, and an ANN to estimate the duty cycle of a DC/DC converter, enabling the system to consistently operate at its maximum power point. The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</description>

      <title>Safe Control of Multi-Agent Systems with Minimal Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many multi-agent systems, communication is limited by bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Designing controllers that achieve coordination and safety with minimal communication is critical for scalable and reliable deployment. This paper presents a method for designing controllers that minimize inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems while satisfying safety and coordination requirements, while conforming to communication delay constraints. The control synthesis problem is cast as a rank minimization problem, where a convex relaxation is obtained via system level synthesis. Simulation results on various tasks, including trajectory tracking with relative and heterogeneous sensing, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces inter-agent transmission compared to baseline approaches.</description>
