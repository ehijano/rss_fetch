      <title>Symmetry-Protected $\alpha$-Attractor Hybrid Inflation in Supergravity and Constraints from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symmetry-protected supergravity realization of hybrid $\alpha$-attractor inflation with a constant sequestered uplift. The model achieves an exact analytic embedding of the attractor geometry while maintaining vacuum stability and radiative control. The uplift, generated by a hidden St\"uckelberg $U(1)_D$ sector, preserves the inflaton dynamics and provides an independent handle on the post-inflationary vacuum energy. The framework yields precise next-to-leading-order predictions for the scalar spectral tilt and tensor amplitude, fully consistent with current ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and Planck data. Radiative and geometric corrections remain exponentially suppressed, ensuring the robustness of the inflationary trajectory. This construction offers a minimal, UV-complete, and testable benchmark for embedding $\alpha$-attractor inflation in supergravity, with tensor modes potentially observable by LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Flavor blocking of dark matter thermalization in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide exceptional laboratories for probing dark matter (DM) interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial experiments. We investigate a scenario in which DM couples to electrons and muons through a lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) coupling. In the strong gravitational field of NSs, infalling DM attains semi-relativistic velocities that activate inelastic transitions $\chi e \leftrightarrow \chi \mu$, leading to efficient energy deposition through scattering and annihilation. We show that this latter heating mechanism remains efficient even for $p$-wave suppressed annihilations. This is due to \textsl{flavor blocking} of DM thermalization with the NS, as LFV interactions become forbidden for low kinetic energies of $\chi$. The resulting DM-induced heating can sustain NS surface temperatures of $T_s \gtrsim 2 \times 10^3~\mathrm{K}$, providing an observable signature for future infrared searches. This establishes NS heating as a powerful probe of flavor-violating DM portals, capable of probing thermal targets beyond the reach of direct, indirect, accelerator-based searches, as we illustrate for the axion-like particle (ALP) mediator.</description>

      <title>Probing Lepton Flavour Universality with $\Lambda_b$ decays to $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the rare baryonic decay $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \tau^+ \tau^-$ as a probe of new physics (NP) coupled preferentially to third-generation fermions. Within the Standard Model, we evaluate the branching ratio and the lepton-flavour-universality (LFU) ratio $R_{\Lambda}^{\tau/\mu}$, including both perturbative and long-distance charm contributions. We show that the LFU ratio can be predicted with an uncertainty below 10%. Possible NP effects arising from lepton non-universal dynamics are analysed within an effective field theory framework motivated by the current anomalies in $b \to c\tau\nu$ and $b \to s\mu^+\mu^-$ transitions. In this context, $R_{\Lambda}^{\tau/\mu}$ can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, offering a clear target for upcoming searches. The implications for the related mode $\Lambda_b \to pK\tau^+\tau^-$ are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>New Avenues for $|\Delta B|$ = 2 Processes Beyond Neutron-Antineutron Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore baryon-number-violating ($|\Delta B| = 2$) processes beyond the well-known neutron-antineutron ($n - \bar{n}$) oscillations, focusing on the $\Lambda - \bar \Lambda$ system. The presence of a strange quark in the $\Lambda$ baryon introduces a new set of six-quark operators roughly of the form $(uds)^2$, which are different from the $(udd)^2$ operators responsible for $n - \bar{n}$ oscillations. Using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we classify all dimension-9 operators that cause $|\Delta B|=2$ transitions and study their UV completions mediated by exotic scalar fields with trilinear interactions. We demonstrate that in these models, $\Lambda - \bar \Lambda$ oscillations can occur at tree level, with $n - \bar{n}$ mixing potentially appearing at higher loop levels. We employ a chiral effective theory to constrain the effective mass mixing $\delta m_\Lambda$, deriving bounds from current experimental limits on $n - \bar{n}$ oscillations and dinucleon decays such as $p \,p \to K^+ K^+$. These bounds indicate that $\Lambda - \bar{\Lambda}$ oscillations probe a complementary parameter space, sensitive to baryon-number violation at scales up to $10^2-10^3$ TeV. We show that the existing indirect bounds make it challenging to provide a competitive bound on $\delta m_\Lambda$ at BESIII.</description>

      <title>Exploring Anisotropic Effects in Magnetized Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of cold magnetized quark matter within a nonlocal Nambu Jona Lasinio (nlNJL) model. Our study addresses the equation of state, anisotropic pressures, quark density, speed of sound, and magnetic susceptibility, with direct comparison to the chiral limit. Strong magnetic fields are found to generate marked anisotropy: the longitudinal pressure and speed of sound are enhanced, approaching the causal bound in the lowest Landau-level (LLL) regime, while the transverse components are systematically reduced. The quark density exhibits magnetic catalysis, increasing with both the chemical potential and the magnetic field strength. At moderate to high fields, the critical chemical potential decreases with increasing $eB$, signaling the occurrence of inverse magnetic catalysis at finite chemical potential ($\mu$IMC). Magnetic susceptibility displays oscillations around zero in low fields, driven by de Haas van Alphen like effects, and settles at positive values for strong fields, consistent with an overall growth of magnetization. Compared with the chiral limit, the inclusion of finite current quark masses does not modify the overall oscillatory behavior, but changes the nature of the Landau level transitions, which become weakly first order instead of second order.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Discovery Prospects for a Leptophilic Gauge Boson $Z_\ell$ at CEPC and ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery prospects of a leptophilic gauge boson Z_l at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, focusing on a comparative study of the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). This state can arise from an additional U(1)'_l gauge symmetry under which quarks are neutral and all leptons have a universal charge, motivated by neutrino oscillations and physics beyond the Standard Model. As a clean benchmark we study $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ including realistic initial state radiation (ISR) and beamstrahlung. We find that CEPC at sqrt(s)=240 GeV can probe couplings down to $g_l \sim 10^{-3}$ for $Z_l$ masses up to about 220 GeV, while the ILC extends the sensitivity to heavier states in the multi-hundred GeV range through its higher sqrt(s) stages. These results highlight the complementarity of circular and linear colliders in testing purely leptophilic interactions.</description>

      <title>Accessing baryon-antibaryon generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^{\pm} \gamma \to e^{\pm} B \bar{B} $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\gamma^* \gamma \to B \bar{B}$ is the golden process to access chiral-even di-baryon generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) as deeply virtual Compton scattering has proven to be for the generalized parton distributions. In the framework of colinear QCD factorization where the leading twist amplitude is the convolution of GDAs and a perturbatively calculable coefficient function, we study the scattering amplitude for the baryonic channels where $B$ is a spin $1/2$ baryon such as the nucleon or hyperon $\Lambda, \Sigma$. Taking into account the interfering QED amplitude, we calculate the cross section of the $e^\pm \gamma \to e^\pm B \bar B$ process that can be experimentally studied in $e^- e^+$ as well as in electron-ion facilities. We explore both the final state polarization summed case and the polarization dependent effects. Numerical estimates are presented for $e^- \gamma \to e^- p \bar{p}$, using motivated models for GDAs. Our results show that a first extraction of baryon-antibaryon GDAs from experimental measurements is feasible at Belle II.</description>

      <title>An anomaly-free leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ completion of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal and fully anomaly-free realization of a universal leptophilic $U(1)'_{\ell}$ gauge symmetry, under which all Standard-Model leptons carry a common charge while quarks remain neutral. Gauge consistency is restored by introducing one vectorlike lepton family and singlet scalars whose vacuum expectation values both break $U(1)'_{\ell}$ and generate masses for the new gauge boson $Z_{\ell}$ and the heavy leptons.
  We derive compact anomaly-cancellation conditions, closed-form $Z_{\ell}$ couplings and decay widths, and the structure of gauge--kinetic mixing, including the trace condition $\mathrm{Tr}(YQ')=0$ that suppresses radiative mixing. The setup naturally embeds a type-I seesaw for neutrino masses and provides a stable singlet field as a minimal dark-matter candidate. Collider and precision constraints are expressed analytically over the full parameter space, covering pure leptophilic production, small-mixing hadron colliders, and the contact-interaction limit $M_{Z_{\ell}}\!\gg\!\sqrt{s}$.
  The model therefore provides a single, internally consistent benchmark that unifies gauge, scalar, Yukawa, neutrino, and dark-matter sectors, and is directly suited for global data recasts and targeted searches at future lepton and hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Predictions for CP violation in anti-triplet beauty baryon to charmonium decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent 3.9$\sigma$ evidence for CP violation from the LHCb collaboration in decays of an anti-triplet beauty baryon to a charmonium, an octet baryon, and a pseudoscalar meson, we perform, for the first time, a systematic analysis of this class of decays within the framework of flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry.
  Several predictions for branching ratios and CP violating relations which can be tested in future experiments are found, in particular $\Delta A_{CP} = A_{CP}(\Lambda_b^0 \to p \pi^- J/\psi) - A_{CP}(\Lambda_b^0 \to p K^- J/\psi) = A_{CP}(\Lambda_b^0 \to n \pi^0 J/\psi) - A_{CP}(\Lambda_b^0 \to (n K_S, n K_L) J/\psi)$. Our results provide guidance to test the availability of $SU(3)$ symmetry and search for possible CP violation effects in this class of decays.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the Minimal Scale Invariant Two-Higgs-Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the Scale Invariant Two Higgs Doublet Model (\textit{SI2HDM})~\cite{Lee:2012jn}. In this framework, the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered radiatively, and the entire scalar mass spectrum, including that of the $125$ \textrm{GeV} Higgs boson, is generated at the one loop level. After imposing stringent theoretical and experimental constraints, a highly constrained viable parameter space is identified, where the SM-like Higgs mass is purely radiative. The model predicts substantial suppression in the triple Higgs couplings and the di-Higgs production cross section at the LHC13, which can be reduced by up to $45.5~\%$ compared to the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>RG evolution and effect of intermediate new-physics on $\Delta B=1$ four-fermion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the stringent experimental bounds on proton lifetime and the need for precise low-energy predictions, there has been renewed interest in the renormalization group (RG) evolution of Wilson coefficients for baryon number violating (BNV) operators and their characteristic new-physics scales. In this work, we analyze the RG running of dimension-six four-fermion operators in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme that mediate nucleon decay channels such as $p \to e^+ \pi^0$, while systematically accounting for the impact of baryon number conserving (BNC) new-physics that can enter the theory at an intermediate scale as higher-dimensional effective field theory operator. These BNC operators mix with BNV ones at 1-loop and alter the RG flow. The running is performed from the electroweak scale up to representative intermediate scales of $10^4~\text{GeV}$, $10^6~\text{GeV}$, and $10^9~\text{GeV}$, corresponding to possible thresholds for new BNC degrees of freedom. Comparing the RG evolved coefficients with current experimental bounds on nucleon decay lifetimes, we find that the inclusion of BNC-BNV mixing, dominated by top quark loops, can significantly lower the effective proton decay scale. A Python package is provided to facilitate the RG evolution of nucleon-decay Wilson coefficients, allowing for the inclusion of generic BNC effects.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Hyper-Kamiokande to sub-eV Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the sensitivity of Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) to light sterile neutrinos within the $(3+1)$ framework, consisting of three active and one sterile neutrino state. We focus on the regime where the new mass-squared splitting satisfies $\Delta m_{41}^{2} \lesssim 1$ eV$^{2}$, a parameter space complementary to short-baseline sterile-neutrino searches. Using both accelerator and atmospheric neutrino samples, we evaluate the expected capability of Hyper-K to constrain active-sterile mixing. Our results show that Hyper-K can significantly improve current bounds on sterile-neutrino parameters and achieve sensitivity that is competitive with that of future dedicated experiments.</description>

      <title>Natural Realization of Tens-of-GeV Dark Matter in the GNMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model ($Z_3$-NMSSM), and the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (GNMSSM), incorporating constraints from dark matter (DM) relic density, the LUX-ZEPLIN 2024 experiment (LZ 2024), Higgs data, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results suggest that, among the three frameworks, only GNMSSM can naturally accommodate for light DM with a mass below $100~{\rm GeV}$. As such, the viable supersymmetry candidate is primarily Singlino-like. One key advantage of the GNMSSM is the effective decoupling between interactions that establish the relic density and those that control direct detection, allowing the model to satisfy all current experimental bounds simultaneously. We further explore two characteristic mass hierarchies in the GNMSSM parameter space, each exhibiting distinct phenomenological behaviors. The first hierarchy, $\tilde{S} &lt; \tilde{B} &lt; \tilde{H}$ (Singlino--Bino--Higgsino), involves a relatively light Bino and allows the Higgsino mass parameter, $\mu_{\rm tot}$, to be as low as about $200~{\rm GeV}$, naturally yielding light DM at tens of GeV. The dominant annihilation channels are then $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to A_sA_s$ in the $h_1$ scenario and $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to h_sA_s$ in the $h_2$ scenario, where $h_s$ and $A_s$ denote singlet-dominated CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons, respectively. The second hierarchy, $\tilde{S} &lt; \tilde{H} &lt; \tilde{B}$, corresponds to a heavy Bino. In this case, although the DM phenomenology remains qualitatively similar, LHC constraints require $\mu_{\rm tot} \gtrsim 900~{\rm GeV}$, implying a significant degree of fine-tuning in reproducing the $Z$-boson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the experimental sensitivity to the $CP$-odd admixture in the standard Higgs boson for the process $e^+e^-\to HZ$. The analysis is performed assuming the future lepton collider CEPC reference detector operating at $\sqrt{s}=240~\text{GeV}$ with statistics of $5.6~\text{ab}^{-1}$. Using the WHIZARD generator with the Higgs Characterisation model and the DELPHES detector simulation framework we obtain data samples for different $CP$-odd Higgs admixture parameters $\tilde{c}_{ZZ}$. The initial state radiation (ISR) effects are taken into account in WHIZARD. Angular and ISR energy shift variables are used to distinguish the $CP$-odd and $CP$-even Higgs components. The upper limit on the $CP$-odd Higgs admixture is improved by 20\% with this method compared to the standard analysis with three angular variables.</description>

      <title>Flavored QCD axion and Modular invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-dimensional effective model with $G_{\rm SM}\times SL(2,\mathbb{Z}) \times U(1)_X$ is proposed in string-derived supergravity framework, where $G_{\rm SM}$ is the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and $U(1)_X$ is gauged. We show $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$- and $U(1)_X$-mixed anomalies should vanish. Anomalies induced by K{\"a}hler transformations match those from gaugino chiral rotations. When SM fermions transform nontrivially under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and with vanishing gaugino contributions, the anomaly-free conditions are powerful enough to determine the quark and lepton flavor structures, set scales for $U(1)_X$ breaking, and ensure the strong CP phase remains unmodified. While the Green-Schwarz coefficient $\delta^{\rm GS}_X$ is generically non-zero, vanishing $U(1)_X$ anomalies cause gauge boson decoupling and $\delta^{\rm GS}_X\rightarrow 0$, yielding a massless global $U(1)_X$ without a Nambu-Goldstone mode. We show that the modulus vacuum expectation value stabilizes near $\langle\tau\rangle \approx i$, where exact $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ($T$-duality) is spontaneously broken, removing residual modular symmetry. The framework predicts seesaw-generated neutrino masses and flavored axion properties, with all Yukawa coefficients constrained to unit-magnitude complex numbers. Our model reproduces current quark and lepton data, predicts an axion mass $m_a=1.82\times10^{-4}$ eV and photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|=1.75\times10^{-14}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, and unlike the ordinary case, suppresses flavor-violating axion couplings to $s,d$ quarks and $\mu,e$ leptons to $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^4)$ (with $\lambda$ the Cabibbo angle). It also yields normal neutrino mass hierarchy consistent with oscillation data, $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay rate, and cosmological and astrophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Analytical Inverse QCD Coupling Constant approach and its result for $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for the QCD running coupling constant based on the Analytical Inverse QCD Coupling Constant concept with an additional regularization in the low momentum region. Analyticity in the $q^2$-complex plane, where $q$ is the 4-momentum transfer, is imposed by methods of the Analytic Perturbation Theory. The model incorporates a peculiar low-momentum behavior for $\alpha_s(q^2)$ as a divergence at $q^2=0$ to retrieve color confinement, without spoiling its correct high-momentum behavior. This was achieved by means of a two-parameter regularization function, for which we considered three possible analytic expressions. In fact, in the framework of the Analytic Perturbation Theory, $\alpha_s(q^2)$ assumes a finite value for $q^2=0$, at all perturbative orders (\emph{infrared stability}), hence the infrared divergence can not be implemented. For this reason, we found it more straightforward to work with its reciprocal, namely $\varepsilon_s(q^2) = 1/\alpha_s(q^2)$, imposing its vanishing at the origin of the $q^2$-complex plane via the multiplication of the aforementioned regularizing functions to the spectral density. Once the two free parameters of the regularization functions are settled by fitting to the experimental values of $\alpha_s(q^2)$ at the momenta where these data are available and reliable, the model can reproduce the QCD running coupling constant at any other momentum transferred.} \\ \noindent \textbf{Keywords: }APT, Analytical Inverse QCD coupling constant ICC, regularization functions, $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of higher $\omega$ meson states in the $e^+ e^-\rightarrow b_1(1235) \pi$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of light vector mesons near 2.2 GeV remain poorly understood, impeding progress in mapping the higher-lying hadronic spectrum. Utilizing the newly released BESIII data on the Born cross sections for the process of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow b_1(1235) \pi$, we conduct a combined analysis incorporating theoretical predictions for the mass spectrum and decay properties of $\omega$-meson family. Our fit demonstrates that the enhancement structure near 2.2 GeV originates not from a single resonance, but from the significant interference between the $\omega(4S)$ and $\omega(3D)$ states, which have comparable contributions. This interpretation resolves the apparent discrepancy in the resonance parameters and yields values consistent with theoretical expectations. Our work provides a key interpretation of the vector enhancement structure and establishes a vital framework for identifying higher radial and orbital excitations in the $\omega$ meson family, thereby advancing the mapping of the light-hadron spectrum.</description>

      <title>Quenching of polarized jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets produced in association with a $Z^{0}$ or $W^{\pm}$ boson in hadronic collisions are automatically polarized due to the parity violation of weak interaction, making these processes ideal for understanding the spin transfer from polarized partons to polarized hadrons. Furthermore, leveraging this feature, we can also employ the weak-boson-tagged process to study the quenching phenomenon of polarized jets, an aspect that has rarely been discussed in the literature. In this work, we compute the polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in $pp$ collisions and investigate the nuclear modification due to the jet-medium interaction in $AA$ collisions. Our results highlight this process as a valuable probe of polarized parton hadronization and of spin-dependent medium effects in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Modulations in Photon-Induced Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent theoretical developments and experimental measurements of azimuthal modulations in photon-induced processes, covering both ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) and $e^+e^-$ colliders. The azimuthal asymmetries $\cos(n\phi)$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) serve as precision diagnostics that probe the linear polarization of coherent photons, final-state soft radiation effects, and quantum interference phenomena at the femtometer scale. In UPCs, we discuss dilepton production, diffractive dijet and vector meson production, where theoretical predictions show excellent agreement with STAR, ALICE, and CMS measurements. The unique double-slit interference effect in nucleus-nucleus collisions plays a crucial role in describing experimental observations. At $e^+e^-$ colliders, $\gamma\gamma\to\pi\pi$ azimuthal asymmetries enable the direct extraction of helicity amplitude phases, with important implications for hadronic light-by-light scattering and the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Azimuthal modulations establish a powerful tool for multi-dimensional nuclear imaging and precision QED/QCD tests.</description>

      <title>Neural Fake Factor Estimation Using Data-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a high-energy physics data analysis, the term "fake" backgrounds refers to events that would formally not satisfy the (signal) process selection criteria, but are accepted nonetheless due to mis-reconstructed particles. This can occur, e.g., when leptons from secondary decays are incorrectly identified as originating from the hard-scatter interaction point (known as non-prompt leptons), or when other physics objects, such as hadronic jets, are mistakenly reconstructed as leptons (resulting in mis-identified leptons). These fake leptons are usually estimated using data-driven techniques, one of the most common being the Fake Factor method. This method relies on predicting the fake lepton contribution by reweighting data events, using a scale factor (i.e. fake factor) function. Traditionally, fake factors have been estimated by histogramming and computing the ratio of two data distributions, typically as functions of a few relevant physics variables such as the transverse momentum $p_\text{T}$ and pseudorapidity $\eta$. In this work, we introduce a novel approach of fake factor calculation, based on density ratio estimation using neural networks trained directly on data in a higher-dimensional feature space. We show that our method enables the computation of a continuous, unbinned fake factor on a per event basis, offering a more flexible, precise, and higher-dimensional alternative to the conventional method, making it applicable to a wide range of analyses. A simple LHC open data analysis we implemented confirms the feasibility of the method and demonstrates that the ML-based fake factor provides smoother, more stable estimates across the phase space than traditional methods, reducing binning artifacts and improving extrapolation to signal regions.</description>

      <title>Vector Leptoquark Mediated Leptonic Decay of the Heavy-Light $B$-Meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the purely leptonic decay of the heavy-light $B$-meson in the $U_1$ Vector Leptoquark Model at leading order and with one loop QCD corrections. The topology of this amplitude is characterised by direct quark-lepton vertices which allow for Lepton Flavour Universality Violation, even at the leading order. Signatures of New Physics theoretically show up in the effective meson decay constant. By accommodating the Leptoquark contributions in the lattice improved uncertainty bounds of the meson decay constant, we constrain the upper limits of the quark-lepton couplings in the $U_1$ Leptoquark Model under consideration.</description>

      <title>Beyond Universality: Probing Lepton Flavor in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global analysis of lepton-flavor-specific operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), combining data from collider and flavor physics experiments. We systematically explore various lepton-flavor scenarios, including flavor-specific, universal, and democratic patterns, while employing a minimal flavor violation (MFV) ansatz in the quark sector. We constrain a set of 17 dimension-six SMEFT operators using a Bayesian fitting approach. Our analysis yields stringent bounds on the Wilson coefficients, probing new physics scales up to $\mathcal{O}(1000)$\,TeV. The strongest constraints are obtained in lepton-flavor universal and lepton-flavor democratic scenarios, in particular for the electroweak dipole operators. We further provide posterior-based predictions for $B \to K^{(*)} \nu \bar \nu$ and $B \to (\pi, \rho) \nu \bar \nu$ decays, highlighting their role as probes of the MFV hypothesis in upcoming Belle II measurements. Our results demonstrate the complementarity of collider and flavor observables, the impact of flavor assumptions on global SMEFT fits, and establish robust limits on extensions of the Standard Model in the lepton sector.</description>

      <title>Isotone Chain Study of $\bar{p}$-atom spectroscopy and Strong Spin-orbit splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiprotonic atoms have served as a pivotal tool for investigating the properties of baryon-baryon interactions, including their spin dependence. Examining the spin-orbit splittings induced by their strong interactions also could help clarify the nature of the $\bar{p}$-nucleus interactions and their fraction mediated by scalar and vector mesons. Although the strong spin-orbit splittings for a certain nucleus have been observed experimentally, thorough theoretical investigations have not yet been conducted. In this study, theoretical calculations based on the Dirac equation are systematically performed for nuclei along several isotone ``chains''. As a result, it is found that the magnitude of the strong spin-orbit splittings exhibits a significant dependence not only on the corresponding level shifts and widths almost linearly, but also on whether the optical potential enters as a vector or scalar potential. A simple perturbative analysis indicates that the relativistic corrections have a dominant effect the magnitude of the splittings. These results are expected to provide deeper insights into $\bar{p}$-nucleus interactions, and by extension baryon-baryon interactions, as well as into the properties of the mesons that mediate them.</description>

      <title>Bridging the divide: axion searches and axino phenomenology at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a phenomenological model extending the minimal supersymmetric standard model containing axions and their supersymmetric partner, the axino. In the supersymmetric DFSZ axion model, the axino has tree level couplings to the higgs sector. In the case where R-parity is conserved, collider experiments may be sensitive to displaced decays of heavier neutralino states into lighter, mostly axino states. We present a sensitivity analysis using a model in which mostly higgsino next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle states decay into a mostly axino lightest supersymmetric particle. The model is studied using Monte Carlo simulation produced using MadGraph and estimates of experimental sensitivities to the model, including detector simulation and kinematic selections, are evaluated using the MadAnalysis5 framework. For a higgsino mass below 1 TeV, the axion decay constant below $f_a &lt; 10^{11}$ GeV can be effectively probed by the Large Hadron Collider with an integrated luminosity of 140 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. This work demonstrates that supersymmetric DFSZ axion models can be studied with existing collider experiments, offering complementary sensitivity to direct-detection and astrophysical searches and paving the way for broader exploration of supersymmetric axion scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Cold and dense matter is expected to be in a color-superconducting state. Here we review two calculations, relevant for fundamental properties and applications of color superconductivity, respectively: the weak-coupling QCD calculation of the fermionic energy gap together with the magnetic screening masses of the gauge bosons, and the calculation of bulk viscosity from a non-leptonic electroweak process. These calculations are supplemented by a discussion of color superconductors with mismatched Fermi momenta, and they are embedded in the context of the state of the art by giving an overview of previous and ongoing work and future directions.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected gravitational collapse and multi-messenger signatures: Beyond spherical symmetry in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for multi-messenger signatures arising from quantum-corrected gravitational collapse within an extended Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) loop quantum gravity model incorporating perturbative asymmetries. By developing a consistent perturbation theory for non-spherical modes on the quantum-corrected spherically symmetric background, we resolve the fundamental tension between spherical symmetry assumptions and gravitational wave emission requirements. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum geometric effects naturally seed asymmetric perturbations during the bounce phase, leading to observable gravitational wave bursts with mass-dependent frequencies in the range $f_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{3}$ Hz and distinctive electromagnetic counterparts via quantum field effects in curved spacetime. Through self-consistent calculations based on the effective AOS framework, we compute the coupling between quantum bounce dynamics and perturbative modes, yielding gravitational wave strains $h \sim 10^{-23}$--$10^{-21}$ at 100 Mpc for primordial black holes with masses $M \sim 1$--$100$ $M_{\odot}$. The electromagnetic emission mechanism is analyzed through detailed calculations of dynamic Casimir effects and coherent field amplification in time-dependent quantum geometry. Our parameter sensitivity analysis reveals detection prospects that are critically dependent on primordial black hole abundance constraints, with realistic event rates of $\mc{R} \sim 10^{-3}$--$10^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ within current observational limits. These results provide testable predictions for quantum gravity theories while extending previous work beyond spherical symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Opportunities for Imaging Light Nuclei with a Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will address several outstanding puzzles in modern nuclear physics. Key questions, such as the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and the origin of their mass and spin, can be explored through high-energy electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($\theta \sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present a systematic study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.</description>

      <title>Two-body Dirac equation in DSR: results for fermion-antifermion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a modified two-body Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, inspired by Amelino-Camelia's doubly special relativity (DSR). We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant \alpha behaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \(\alpha_{eff(E)}/\alpha \approx 1 - \frac{E}{4E_p}\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of its kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Generalised anomalies, QCD$_4$, and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last decade, the notion of an 't Hooft anomaly has been generalised to the case of discrete symmetries. An interesting instance, discussed by Tanizaki, is the mixed anomaly between the discrete axial symmetry and the flavour and baryonic symmetries in massless QCD$_4$. The goal of this note is to provide a derivation of this anomaly from a top-down holographic dual of QCD$_4$. It is found that the topological couplings in the bulk supergravity dual of the D4-D8 system encode Tanizaki's anomaly, once fluctuations around the bulk gauge fields are turned on. A technical challenge for this computation is the difficulty in maintaining gauge invariance of supergravity theories in the presence of D-branes. To overcome this issue, a compact formulation of the flux sector of (massive) type IIA supergravity in the presence of D8 branes is presented. A crucial ingredient in the analysis is the need for smearing the D8 branes, in order to impose $\tau$-shift invariance on the fluctuation ansatz.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Energy Microphysics with kSZ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe is well established by geometric probes, yet its physical origin remains poorly understood. Most constraints on dark energy arise from background observables -- supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background -- which mainly test the homogeneous expansion history. To move beyond this limitation, we examine how kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (kSZ) tomography, combined with galaxy clustering, can probe perturbative effects of dark energy and improve constraints on its background parameters. Using a Fisher-matrix analysis of the joint power spectra for LSST- and CMB-S4-like surveys, we quantify the additional information kSZ tomography contributes to dark-energy inference. Including kSZ data tightens constraints on $w_0$ by 15 % and on $w_a$ by 32 %, with parameter degeneracies distinct from those of geometric probes. We also assess the detectability of dark-energy perturbations through a two-parameter model, finding that for canonical sound speed ($c_s=1$) the effects are sub-percent and confined to horizon scales, while smaller sound speeds shift them to accessible $k$-ranges. Near-term kSZ measurements will primarily serve to test the consistency between background and perturbative signals, while future low-noise, high-resolution surveys may begin to uncover the microphysical properties of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Grand Unification Higgs-$\mathcal{R}^2$ Inflation: Complementarity between Proton Decay and CMB Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a predictive $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework for cosmic inflation in the Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ formulation of gravity. In this model, a GUT Higgs field both drives inflation and induces intermediate-scale symmetry breaking, thereby linking primordial cosmology, gauge unification, and topological defect formation. A partial inflationary phase of $N_I \sim 10$--$17$ $e$-folds following monopole formation can dilute magnetic monopoles to abundances $Y_M \sim 10^{-35}$--$10^{-27}$. The model yields Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) predictions of $0.955 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.974$, accommodating the tensions between Planck-BICEP ($n_s \approx 0.965$) and Planck+ACT ($n_s \approx 0.971$) via $\phi &lt; M$ and $\phi &gt; M$ branches repectively. The predicted tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 8\times10^{-4}$ lies within current observational constraints and is accessible to forthcoming experiments, including the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD. The resulting correlations between the unification scale $M_U$, the inflationary observables $(n_s, r)$, and proton-decay lifetimes highlight a complementarity between CMB measurements and proton-decay searches, with regions of parameter space testable in forthcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

Abstract: We report on an initiative that seeks to encourage high school girls to develop critical thinking and transferable skills widely used in scientific work, as well as to generate a concrete space of opportunities for girls to experience how real science is done. Our "Ni\~nas At\'omicas" workshop combines the teaching of particle physics, electronics, programming and scientific methodology through building and operating a dedicated experiment: a muon counter. Girls from all over Chile can apply to this workshop, where every year they are guided by female scientists for two weeks. We report on the contents and methodology of our workshop and provide details on how to build the muon detector counter experiment. We report results on muon flux and proper lifetime, two muon properties which can be extracted from the data collected by the girls with the muon detectors they built themselves. Insights into the girl's experiences during the 2024 and 2025 editions of the workshop are also detailed, with the aim to contribute to the wider physics education research and outreach communities.</description>

      <title>Hunting for Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter in a Decade-long Blazar Optical Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidates whose coupling to photons induces periodic oscillations in the polarization angle of astrophysical light. This work reports the first search for such a signature using ten years of optical polarimetric monitoring of the blazar 1ES 1959+650. No statistically significant periodicity is detected using a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Monte Carlo analysis. Assuming a central DM density in the host galaxy, this null result places tight upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant at $g_{a\gamma}&lt;(5.8 \times 10^{-14}-1.8\times 10^{-10})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across a broad ALP mass range of $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-23}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our constraints surpass those from Very Long Baseline Array polarimetry of active galactic jets and are competitive with those from long-term Galactic pulsar timing of PSR J0437-4715 over the same ALP mass window. These results establish long-term blazar polarimetry as a competitive and complementary approach for probing axion-like DM on extragalactic scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Universal modified function in conjunction with the short range correlation effect to extract the nuclear $xF_3^A$ structure function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are comprehensive and not reliant on the process. They are affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. As a recent approach, in order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), the nucleon pair PDFs are utilized to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which are confined to a nucleus. Nucleon pair PDFs stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation which is called short range correlation (SRC) and are proportional to common nucleon PDFs. In this regard a modified universal function is constructed which provides a test for SRC in (neutrino)-nucleus scattering. In fact we can show that the modification of the structure function of nucleons bound in atomic nuclei (known as the EMC effect) are consistently accounted for within the frame work of a universal modification of nucleons in SRC pairs. In this article, based on the strategy which was introduced in Ref.\cite{nature}, we are investigating to find the universality behaviour for the ratio of nonsinglet $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function. The numerical calculations performed within the CTEQ framework confirm the universality feature of the concerned ratio, as has been established for the ratio of the structure function $F^A_2$ in Ref. \cite{nature}. Following that we reformulate the $R_{EMC}$ nuclear weight function which relates the free and bound structure function in terms of modified universal function. It makes us a possibility to achieve $R_{EMC}$ and finally $xF_3^A$ nuclear structure function for each nucleus only by considering the specified feature of nucleus.The results are compared with the nuclear $xF_3$ structure function which are computing from bound PDFs, based on some parameterizations models. The findings, considering the SRC effect, demonstrating qualitative agreement with nCTEQ15 and EPPS21 parametrization models and also the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter in neutron stars: halo morphologies and their suppression by vacuum-like pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutron stars that contain a unified dark sector composed of cold, degenerate fermionic dark matter and a vacuum-like dark-energy component. Within a general-relativistic two-fluid framework that allows a covariantly conserved, gradient-driven energy exchange between baryons and the dark sector, we quantify how dark microphysics reshapes global structure when the total gravitational radius need not coincide with the luminous baryonic radius. Using a state-of-the-art baryonic equation of state, we explore the halo-forming mass range for fermionic dark matter with particle masses of 400 MeV and 1 GeV, and we characterize sequences by the difference between the total and luminous radii and by the fractional difference between the total and baryonic masses. We confirm established trends: lighter fermions typically support low-density halos that increase the total radius by several kilometers at nearly fixed mass, whereas masses near 1 GeV tend to shrink halos and make the two radii appreciably closer. Our central new result is that a percent-level vacuum-like admixture markedly reduces halo formation, shrinking the radius difference from several kilometers to sub-kilometer scales and the fractional mass difference to $\lesssim 1\%$. Combined gravitational-wave and X-ray observations offer a practical route to bound the halo size and the allowed vacuum-like fraction.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for extracting the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons from magnetically induced spin depolarization measurements using the n2EDM apparatus. This method is also sensitive to the storage properties of the materials used to trap ultracold neutrons, specifically, whether collisions are specular or diffuse. We highlight the sensitivity of this new technique by comparing the two different storage chambers of the n2EDM experiment. We validate the extraction by comparing to an independent measurement for how this energy spectrum is polarized through a magnetic-filter, and finally, we calculate the neutron center-of-mass offset, an important systematic effect for measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parity-Doublet Model (PDM) is a chirally invariant effective theory for strong-interaction matter involving nucleons and their opposite-parity partners in a parity-doubling framework. We introduce a multiplicatively renormalizable mean-field approach to include the baryonic vacuum contributions to the resulting grand-canonical potential in an explicitly renormalization-group invariant form. As an application, we evaluate the pertinent thermodynamics of two-flavor symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, focusing on the restoration of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry at baryon densities and temperatures relevant for the astrophysics of neutron stars. Special attention is paid to the effect of the baryonic vacuum fluctuations on the evolution of chiral condensate with baryon density and temperature for specific choices of the chirally invariant baryon mass $m_0$ to demonstrate the importance of consistently including these vacuum fluctuations in the PDM.</description>

      <title>The poltergeist mechanism -- Enhancement of scalar-induced gravitational waves with early matter-dominated era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial density perturbations provide a powerful probe of the Universe's thermal history, which may include an early matter-dominated (eMD) era predicted by well-motivated particle-physics models. The induced GWs can be significantly enhanced when the Universe undergoes a sudden transition from an eMD era to an era with pressure, such as a radiation or kination era. This enhancement arises from the growth of density perturbations during the eMD era and their rapid oscillations during the era with pressure. This phenomenon is called the poltergeist mechanism. In this review, we explain the essence of the poltergeist mechanism and explore concrete scenarios in which such an enhancement can occur.</description>

Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to a predicted phenomena in quantum chromodynamics that manifests as a charge separation along an external magnetic field, driven by an imbalance of quark chirality. Searches for the CME has been carried out by azimuthal particle correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions where such a chirality imbalance is anticipated and a strong magnetic field is created in the initial stage. No conclusive experimental evidence on the CME has been established so far because of large background contributions to azimuthal correlation observables. We review the status of the experimental search for the CME, covering the observables used, the techniques to mitigate backgrounds, and the strengths and limitations of various experimental approaches, and outline a future prospect of the CME search in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the lepton flavor violating decay modes $b \to s \mu ^{\pm} \tau ^{\mp}$ in SMEFT approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the consequences of various new physics operators on the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decay modes mediated through $b \to s \ell _1 \ell _2$ transitions. We scrutinize the imprints of the (pseudo)scalar and axial(vector) operators on the exclusive LFV decay channels $ B_{(s)} \rightarrow (\phi, K^{*}, K_{2}^{*})\ell_{1}\ell_{2}$ and $\Lambda_{b}\rightarrow \Lambda \ell_{1}\ell_{2}$, where $\ell_{1}, \ell_{2}$ represent $\mu$ or $\tau$. The new physics parameters are constrained by using the upper limits of the branching fractions of the $B \to \tau \mu$ and $B \to K \tau \mu$ processes, assuming the new physics couplings to be real. We then explore the key observables such as the branching fraction, the forward-backward asymmetry, and the longitudinal polarisation fraction of the $B \to (K^*, \phi, K_2^*) \tau ^{\pm} \mu ^{\mp}$ decays. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the new physics couplings on the baryonic $\Lambda _b \to \Lambda \tau ^{\pm} \mu ^{\mp}$ decay channels mediated by the $b \to s$ quark level transition. With the experimental prospects at LHCb upgrade and Belle II, we also predict the upper limits of the above-discussed observables, which could intrigue the new physics search in these channels.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

Abstract: The flavor-changing neutral current decays of heavy bottom quark, alongside the flavor-changing charged current processes mediated by $b \to (c, u)$ in semileptonic $B$ decays are emerged as powerful tools for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we focus on the feasibility of interpreting the processes mediated by $b \to c \tau \nu$ transitions, in particular, the semileptonic $b$-baryonic decay modes $\Sigma_b \to \Sigma_c^{(*)} \tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Xi_b \to \Xi_c \tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ in the context of SMEFT approach. We perform a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of new physics operators on various observables such as branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry parameter, lepton non-universal observable and the longitudinal polarization fraction of the $b$-baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>First Sub-MeV Dark Matter Search with the QROCODILE Experiment Using Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>The role of the $f_0(1710)$ and $a_0(1710)$ resonances in the $D^0 \to \rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $D^0 \to \rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ decays which proceed in a direct mode via internal emission with equal rates. Yet, the experimental branching ratio for the $\rho^0 \phi$ mode is twice as big as that for the $\omega \phi$ mode. We find a natural explanation based on the extra indirect mechanism where $K^{*+} K^{*-}$ is produced via external emission and that channel undergoes final state interaction with other vector--vector channels to lead to the $\rho^0 \phi$, $\omega \phi$ final states, with transition amplitudes dominated by the $a_0(1710)$ resonance, recently discovered, and $f_0(1710)$ respectively. The large coupling of the $a_0(1710)$ to the $\rho^0 \phi$ channel is mostly responsible for this large ratio of the production rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resum threshold double logarithms in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium that arise from singularities near the boundary of phase space. This resolves the catastrophic failure in the conventional approach based on fixed-order perturbation theory calculations in nonrelativistic QCD, where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse momentum can turn negative. We identify the root cause of this negative cross section problem as the appearance of threshold logarithms in radiative corrections, and resum them to all orders in perturbation theory at the leading double logarithmic level. We find that resummation of threshold logarithms is imperative for describing measured $J/\psi$ production rates at large transverse momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Local form factor subtraction for three-loop QCD corrections to electroweak production in quark-antiquark annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a local subtraction framework to three-loop QCD corrections for the production of multiple electroweak bosons in quark-antiquark annihilation. We derive two-loop Ward identities that ensure the factorisation of most collinear singularities from the hard-scattering process in the sum over integrands. Infrared and ultraviolet singularities are removed point-by-point in loop momentum space using a minimal set of counterterms, which can be integrated analytically in terms of known master integrals. Additional counterterms eliminate non-factorising terms arising from loop momentum shifts and one-loop corrections to the gluon three-point function. We identify previously unknown non-factorising loop polarisation effects in the single-collinear regions, which pose challenges for local integrability and require further investigation. The techniques presented here are a first crucial step in formulating a systematic approach for constructing finite integrands for general electroweak amplitudes at three-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework is utilized to generate $^{197}_{79}Au+^{197}_{79}Au$, $^{96}_{44}Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$, and $^{96}_{40}Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$ collision events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The CME signal is modulated through the axial charge per entropy density ($n_5/s$) in each event to produce data sets with varying CME signal strengths. Additionally, a 33$\%$ local charge conservation (LCC) is implemented in each event. These data sets are analyzed using CME-sensitive two- and three-particle correlators. Furthermore, the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) is employed to identify potential CME-like events within each data set. The identified events selected using the SDM exhibit characteristics consistent with CME. The CME fraction in these events is quantified while accounting for background contributions.</description>

Results for the total cross - sections and associated rapidity distributions are presented, and the number of events at the LHC and FCC are estimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how extensions of the Standard Model (SM) involving heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) can be probed at FCC-ee, the proposed high-energy circular $e^+e^-$ collider. Using the effective field theory (EFT) approach, we determine the impact of new interactions on the production and decay of HNLs at FCC-ee. In particular, we consider $d\leq 7$ $\nu$SMEFT operators which induce vector, scalar and tensor four-fermion and effective charged- and neutral-current interactions of HNLs, that may also mix with the active neutrinos of the SM. We consider sensitivities to the active-sterile mixing and EFT Wilson coefficients from monophoton searches and displaced vertex decay signatures. In both analyses, we consider the scenarios where HNLs are Majorana or Dirac fermions. We translate the upper bounds on the Wilson coefficients to lower limits on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Study of gravitational waves from phase transitions in three-component dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies gravitational waves in a dark matter model composed of three types of particles with distinct spins, along with a scalar field $\phi$ that mediates interactions between Standard Model particles and dark matter. It discusses the electroweak phase transition following the Big Bang, during which all particles are initially massless due to the inactive Higgs mechanism. As temperature decreases, the effective potential reaches zero at two points, leading to two minima at the critical temperature ($T_c$), and eventually to a true vacuum state. The formation of new vacuum bubbles, where electroweak symmetry is broken and particles acquire mass, generates gravitational waves as these bubbles interact with the fabric of space-time. The paper derives the gravitational wave frequency and detection range based on the model's parameters, aligning with observational data from the Planck satellite and detection thresholds from PandaX-4T and XENONnT for some parameter points. It concludes by comparing the predicted background gravitational wave density with the sensitivities of LISA, BBO and $\mu$-Ares detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collider phenomenology of leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs), i.e. pseudoscalar particles that couple only to charged leptons. Loops of charged leptons induce effective interactions of the ALPs with photons, which depend on the momenta of the interacting particles and differ between pseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We systematically discuss the form of the interaction with photons for general external momenta and identify the regimes when it can be safely approximated by an effective coupling constant. We use these results to derive novel constraints from LEP and calculate state-of-the-art limits from E137 and NA64 for four different scenarios, in which the ALPs couple either to a single lepton generation or universally to all, for both pseudoscalar and derivative lepton couplings. We collect complementary bounds from astrophysics, flavour, and other laboratory experiments to chart the allowed parameter space of leptophilic ALPs in the MeV-GeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Opening up New Parameter Space for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, yet the minimal production mechanism solely based on active ($\nu_a$)-sterile ($\nu_s$) oscillations is excluded by astrophysical observations. Non-standard self-interactions in either active ($\nu_a-\nu_a$) or sterile ($\nu_s-\nu_s$) sector are known to alter the sterile neutrino DM production in the early Universe, which could alleviate the tension with astrophysical constraints to some extent. Here we propose a novel solution where scalar-mediated non-standard interactions between active and sterile neutrinos ($\nu_a-\nu_s$) generate new production channels for $\nu_s$, independent of the active-sterile mixing and without the need for any fine-tuned resonance or primordial lepton asymmetry. This framework enables efficient sterile neutrino DM production even at vanishingly small mixing angles and opens up new viable regions of parameter space that can be tested with future $X$-ray and gamma-ray observations.</description>

Abstract: We study higher-order QCD corrections beyond NLO for the associated production of a photon with a $W$ boson ($\gamma W^+$ and $\gamma W^-$ production) at the Large Hadron Collider. We calculate the NNLO soft-plus-virtual QCD corrections as well as the N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections to the total production cross section and the photon transverse-momentum distribution in single-particle-inclusive kinematics. The higher-order corrections provide a significant enhancement to the cross section. This is the first calculation of the complete soft-gluon corrections at N$^3$LO in single-particle-inclusive kinematics for a Standard Model process.</description>

      <title>The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model meets the new $(g-2)_\mu$ data and muon neutrino trident scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Muon $g-2$ collaboration at Fermilab has announced their final result of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. By adopting the lattice-QCD evaluation of the leading-order hadronic-vacuum-polarization, this result is now in agreement with the latest theoretical prediction to the $1\sigma$ level. This new result further constrains the allowed parameter space, but does not rule out all possible new physics contributions the muon $g-2$. We study the implications for one of the relevant models, the gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$. When using this model to resolve the previous $4\sigma$ tension, results from muon neutrino trident (MNT) scattering experiments would restrict the mass of the new gauge boson ($Z'$) to be less than $300$ MeV. Since the theory and experimental data difference for muon $g-2$ is lowered down to $1\sigma$, the requirement for $m_{Z'}\lesssim 300\,{\rm MeV}$ is much relaxed. Within the updated allowed range of $Z'$ boson mass, we study the models implications for electron and tauon $g-2$ as well as future muon colliders. We find that muon collider can effectively probe the $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$.</description>

      <title>Review of heat and charge transport in strongly magnetized relativistic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review field-theoretic studies of charge transport in hot relativistic plasmas under strong magnetic fields and extend the analysis to thermal conductivity. The calculations rely on accurately determining the fermion damping rate. Using the Landau-level representation, these damping rates are computed exactly at leading order and incorporated into the Kubo formula to obtain the thermal and electrical conductivity tensors. Our analysis reveals that the mechanisms underlying longitudinal and transverse transport differ significantly. Strong magnetic fields markedly suppress transverse charge transport by confining particles within localized Landau orbits, allowing transport only through quantum transitions between these discrete states. In contrast, longitudinal charge transport is enhanced, as it primarily depends on the reduced scattering probability of particles moving along the direction of the magnetic field. The anisotropy of thermal conductivity is also nontrivial but less pronounced since its underlying transport mechanism is different. We also examine the modification of the Wiedemann--Franz law in strongly magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of doubly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the mass spectra of the doubly heavy baryons are rigorously calculated in the three-quark system under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, by using the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the obtained mass spectra of all doubly heavy baryon families, the contribution of each Hamiltonian term to the energy levels is analyzed. It is found that the spin splitting is mainly determined by the spin-dependent interactions associated with the light quark. Moreover, it is shown that the spin splitting evolves regularly with the mass of heavy quarks by the evolution of the spectral structure, which is consistent with the heavy quark symmetry. Meanwhile, the orbital excitation is dominated by the $\rho$-mode, which is different from that of the singly heavy baryons. At last, our analysis indicates that the $\Xi_{cc}^{+}(3520)$ state should not exist truly and the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}(3621)$ should be the true ground state with $J^{P}$ = $\frac{1}{2}^{+}$. It is recommended to design the corresponding experiments to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^{*}$ in the energy range from 3694 to 3714 MeV.</description>

      <title>Modelling top-quark decays in $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the fixed-order NLO QCD predictions for the $pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process in the $4\ell$ decay channel with the parton-shower based results obtained with the POWHEG and MC@NLO matching methods. In the first case, NLO QCD corrections are consistently included in both the $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production step and the decays of the four top quarks, preserving all spin correlations. In the second approach, higher-order effects in top-quark decays with approximate spin correlations are simulated in the PYTHIA parton-shower framework. Additionally, we analyse the impact of including the so-called matrix element corrections in top-quark decays in both parton-shower matched predictions. The comparison is performed at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level for the LHC centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the possible trajectories the universe may have followed in the QCD phase diagram during the QCD epoch. We focus on the roles of chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation under high imbalances in lepton asymmetry. Adopting the quark-meson model as an effective description of QCD at finite temperature, charge and baryon chemical potentials we show that, for sufficiently large but physically motivated asymmetries, the universe may have entered the pion condensation phase through a first-order phase transition, followed by a second-order phase transition when exiting it. Such a first-order phase transition represents a new possible source of primordial gravitational waves during the QCD epoch.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Quantum Forces for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level. In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM) annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators, and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM searches in the Milky Way or its satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the addition of an $SU(2)$ quadruplet of scalars to the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the extension of the Standard Model through an $SU(2)$ quadruplet of scalars with hypercharge either $3/2$ or $1/2$ (with an additional reflection symmetry in the latter case). We establish, through exact analytical equations, the boundaries of the phase spaces of the gauge-invariant terms that appear in the (renormalizable) scalar potentials. We devise procedures for the determination of necessary and sufficient bounded-from-below conditions on those potentials; we emphasize that one mostly needs to scan the scalar potential over a few \emph{lines}, instead of \emph{surfaces}, in order to establish the boundedness-from-below; this fact allows one to reduce by three orders of magnitude the computational time devoted to that establishment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision measurements of well-known light-by-light reactions lead to important insights of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics (QED) vacuum polarization. The laser of an intense electromagnetic field strength provides an essential tool for exploring nonlinear QED and new physics beyond Standard Model (SM) in the high-precision frontier. In this work, we propose to search for low-energy light-by-light scattering in the collision of a photon beam and a laser pulse of classical background field. We aim to investigate the impact of Born-Infeld (BI) and axion-like particle (ALP) theories on laser-assisted light-by-light scattering. We calculate the QED light-by-light scattering cross section using complete QED helicity amplitudes, and then combine them with the amplitudes in BI or ALP theory to evaluate the total cross section. The laser-assisted SM light-by-light scattering should be observable in future experiments with very moderate integrated luminosities. The sensitivity of laser-assisted light-by-light scattering to BI and ALP parameters is presented.</description>

Abstract: The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$ provides a sensitive probe of exotic interactions between muons mediated by light beyond the Standard Model (BSM) bosons. Recent advances in both experiment and theory have largely reconciled the long-standing discrepancy in $a_\mu$. Using the latest result, $\Delta a_\mu = a^{\rm exp}_\mu - a^{\rm SM}_\mu = (38 \pm 63) \times 10^{-11}$, we derive updated limits on light BSM boson-mediated exotic muon interactions.</description>

      <title>Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from particle physics analyses, we investigate the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) as a framework capable of accommodating a range of current data anomalies across low- and high-energy experiments. These include the so-called 95GeV and 650GeV excesses from Higgs studies, the Electro-Weakino excess from Supersymmetry searches, the latest $(g-2)_\mu$ measurements as well as potential deviations from Standard Model (SM) predictions that would appear as a consequence in mono-$H$ (where $H=h_{\rm SM}$) and -$Z$ signatures of Dark Matter. Our analysis demonstrates that viable NMSSM parameter regions exist where all these features can be accommodated at the $2\sigma$ level while remaining consistent with the most up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. To identify such regions, we employ an efficient numerical scanning strategy assisted by deep learning techniques. We further present several benchmark points that realize these scenarios, offering promising directions for future phenomenological studies.</description>

Abstract: Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa) ensures exact Lorentz-equivariance for arbitrary neural networks with minimal computational overhead. For the LHC, it equivariantly predicts local reference frames for each particle and propagates any-order tensorial information between them. We apply it to graph networks and transformers. We showcase its cutting-edge performance on amplitude regression, end-to-end event generation, and jet tagging. For jet tagging, we introduce a large top tagging dataset to benchmark LLoCa versions of a range of established benchmark architectures and highlight the importance of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Study of the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of the semileptonic decay process \(\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\), focusing on the determination of all six vector and axial-vector form factors that govern the low-energy hadronic matrix elements of the underlying theory. These invariant form factors constitute the essential inputs for describing the decay, and their dependence on the momentum transfer \(q^{2}\) is analyzed across the entire physical kinematic region. To parametrize the \(q^{2}\)dependence, we adopt both the \(z\)-expansion formalism and a polynomial fitting approach. Utilizing parametrizations, we compute the exclusive decay widths for both the electron and muon channels, and subsequently extract the corresponding branching ratios. Furthermore, we evaluate the ratio of decay widths between the muon and electron channels defined as $R^{\mu e} \equiv \frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,\mu\,\bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,e\,\bar{\nu}_{e})}$ obtaining \(R^{\mu e} = 0.196^{+0.009}_{-0.012}\) from the polynomial fit and \(R^{\mu e} = 0.174^{+0.002}_{-0.005}\) from the \(z\) expansion. While both ratios are compatible with previously reported values in the literature, the result from the \(z\) expansion exhibits particularly strong agreement with the averages reported by the Particle Data Group.</description>

      <title>Impact of Evaporation Barriers on Solar-Captured Dark Matter Distributions and Evaporation Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-thermal distributions of dark matter captured by the Sun by solving the linear Boltzmann equation with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo scheme in the space of orbital energy and angular momentum. From the resulting steady-state distribution, we derive the capture rate, the evaporation rate, and the effective annihilation volume, and provide compact fitting formulas across the studied mass ranges for several values of the potential-depth parameter beta. The presence of an in-medium potential deepens the total solar potential and raises the local escape speed, compressing the phase space toward lower specific energy and angular momentum. As a result, the capture rate increases, the evaporation rate is exponentially suppressed, the effective annihilation volume is mildly reduced, and the evaporation mass shifts to smaller values. Maps in the plane of dark-matter mass and scattering cross section quantify these trends, with the evaporation mass indicated on the maps. The results are presented in a form directly applicable to solar-neutrino flux calculations and related dark-matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Impact of Localization in Early-Universe QCD Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a phenomenological modification of the MIT bag model equation of state that incorporates quark localization arising from gluon-induced disorder in the quark-gluon plasma. This model effectively reduces the quark degrees of freedom encoded in the product of the disorder activation function $G(W)$ and the localization efficiency factor $H(T)$. As a result, the critical temperature is increased roughly by 7%. Employing the Friedmann equation, we find that the onset of the phase transition occurs earlier. Consequently, the mixed phase duration is only $8.22\, \mu s$, which is 24% shorter than the bag model, and the hadronic phase cools faster. The Stephan-Boltzmann constant is reached at much higher temperatures, causing the energy density and pressure curves of the bag model to shift downward and yielding better agreement with the lattice QCD data from the HotQCD collaboration. Our results show that the localization of quarks plays a significant role in the cooling dynamics of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Predictive one-zero with vanishing sub-trace texture in neutrino mass matrix in light of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a predictive class of neutrino mass matrices characterized by one texture zero and one vanishing sub-trace within the framework of the scotogenic model, wherein neutrino masses, dark matter, and neutrinoless double beta decay are intrinsically correlated. We analyze twelve viable texture structures -- namely $B_{1,4,5}$, $C_{1,2,\ldots,5}$, $D_{4,5}$, and $F_{5,6}$ -- and examine their implications for the effective Majorana mass $(|M_{ee}|)$ governing neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$. Remarkably, all non-zero entries of the neutrino mass matrix can be parametrized in terms of this effective Majorana mass, establishing a direct theoretical link between low-energy observables and high-scale parameters of the model. Among the twelve textures, eleven predict dark matter masses of order TeV and yield correlated bounds on $|M_{ee}|$ -- making them testable in current and forthcoming $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments -- while the textures $D_4$ and $F_{5,6}$ exhibit comparatively weaker correlations. In contrast, the texture $C_5$ is excluded due to its requirement of unrealistically large Yukawa couplings and its inability to realize dark matter in the TeV regime. Our analysis thus identifies a subset of predictive neutrino mass textures that consistently relate dark matter phenomenology and neutrinoless double beta decay observables within the scotogenic paradigm.</description>

      <title>Tensor polarization and the dissipative damping of vector meson in QCD Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11890v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unexpectedly large and puzzling spin alignment, and thus tensor polarization, of vector mesons has been observed in heavy-ion collisions. Given that tensor polarization represents a fluctuation of spin, we derive, for the first time, a fluctuation-dissipation relation for tensor polarization, where the polarization is proportional to first-order hydrodynamic gradients (e.g., the shear-stress tensor), with dissipative coefficients depending on the particle's damping properties, as characterized by its spectral function. Employing relativistic hydrodynamics at finite density, we find that dissipative contributions can generate substantial spin alignment. We provide illustrative examples (by tuning one coefficients $\alpha_{{\rm sh}}$) that generate a beam energy, $p_T$, and centrality dependence of spin alignment resembling those observed in experiments, offering insights into these puzzling phenomena and demonstrating its potential as a ``spectrometer" for in-medium vector mesons.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Treatment of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Collisionless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic properties in soliton field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface providing surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resembles a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids, providing a field theory description for hydrodynamics with interfaces.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign around 10 GeV results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>
