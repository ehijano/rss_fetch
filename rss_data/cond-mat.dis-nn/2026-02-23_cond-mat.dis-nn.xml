      <title>Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'.</description>

      <title>Overlap locking and non-perturbative effects in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of the locking of the order parameter (or synchronization) in spin glasses at low temperatures. When two systems with independent disorders are coupled, their overlaps become similar. A crucial question is how this effect depends on the strength of the coupling between the two systems. Non-perturbative phenomena are present when $1 \ll \Delta H \ll N$, being $\Delta H$ the coupling Hamiltonian and $N$ the size of the system. In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks in Solving Hard Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly applied to hard optimization problems, often claiming superiority over classical heuristics. However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results from both classical heuristics and GNNs. Our fair comparison shows that classical algorithms still outperform GNNs. We discuss the challenges for neural networks in this domain. Future claims of superiority can be made more robust using our benchmarks, available at https://github.com/ArtLabBocconi/RandCSPBench.</description>

      <title>Topological Exploration of High-Dimensional Empirical Risk Landscapes: general approach, and applications to phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the landscape of empirical risk minimization for high-dimensional Gaussian single-index models (generalized linear models). The objective is to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d \gg 1$) from a loss function $\hat{R}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that depends on pairs of labels $(\mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star)_{i=1}^n$, with $\mathbf{x}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$, in the proportional asymptotic regime $n \asymp d$. Using the Kac-Rice formula, we analyze different complexities of the landscape -- defined as the expected number of critical points -- corresponding to various types of critical points, including local minima. We first show that some variational formulas previously established in the literature for these complexities can be drastically simplified, reducing to explicit variational problems over a finite number of scalar parameters that we can efficiently solve numerically. Our framework also provides detailed predictions for properties of the critical points, including the spectral properties of the Hessian and the joint distribution of labels. We apply our analysis to the real phase retrieval problem for which we derive complete topological phase diagrams of the loss landscape, characterizing notably BBP-type transitions where the Hessian at local minima (as predicted by the Kac-Rice formula) becomes unstable in the direction of the signal. We test the predictive power of our analysis to characterize gradient flow dynamics, finding excellent agreement with finite-size simulations of local optimization algorithms, and capturing fine-grained details such as the empirical distribution of labels. Overall, our results open new avenues for the asymptotic study of loss landscapes and topological trivialization phenomena in high-dimensional statistical models.</description>

      <title>Scaling and tuning to criticality in resting-state human magnetoencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws in biological neural networks have long been investigated. From 1/f noise to neuronal avalanches, evidence of scaling in brain activity has been increasingly linked to tuning to or near criticality. The concept of scaling is intimately related to the renormalization group (RG), in essence providing coarse-grained, simplified descriptions that generalize to classes of diverse physical systems. Following the RG idea, a coarse-graining scheme has recently been proposed for populations of real neurons, and scaling behaviors in collective quantities have been reported in the hippocampus and in different areas of the rat cortex. To bridge the gap between neuronal population scales and species, here we consider large-scale, electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity in the awake resting-state. We demonstrate robust scaling behaviors of collective dynamics across coarse-graining scales, with exponents close to those measured in populations of spiking neurons. Further, we show that dynamics of neuronal avalanches, scale-free cascades of neural activity, are invariant under the proposed coarse-graining approach. Simulations of a non-equilibrium adaptive Ising model inferred from data and apt to reproduce a large repertoire of resting-state brain dynamics indicate that the scaling behaviors of the resting human brain activity emerge close to criticality and depend on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance of the network. While extending the range of validity of previous observations at small spatial scales and pointing to common scaling laws in mammals, the results open the way to a robust (currently missing) non-invasive approach to estimate the E/I balance, a key quantity in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of the Long-Time Asymptotics of the Diffusion Spreadability of Two-Phase Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent diffusion spreadability $\mathcal{S}(t)$ is a powerful dynamical probe of the microstructure of two-phase heterogeneous media across length scales [Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. E.}, 104 054102 (2021)]. It has been shown that when the spectral density takes the power-law form $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(\mathbf{k})\sim |\mathbf{k}|^\alpha$ as the wavenumber $|\mathbf{k}|$ tends to zero, the normalized excess spreadability $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ [proportional to $\mathcal{S}(\infty)-\mathcal{S}(t)$] scales as $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)\sim t^{-\frac{d+\alpha}{2}}$ in the long-time limit $t\to\infty$, enabling one to determine the infinite-wavelength scaling exponent $\alpha$. An algorithm that allows one to reliably extract the exponent $\alpha$ from long-time spreadability data was previously devised [Wang, H., Torquato, S., \emph{Phys. Rev. Appl.}, 17 034022 (2022)]. In this paper, we further improve this procedure to obtain $\alpha$ even more accurately by incorporating higher-order correction terms to the long-time asymptotics and by utilizing analyticity properties of $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$ at the origin. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing hyperuniform ($\alpha&gt; 0$), typical nonhyperuniform ($\alpha=0$), and antihyperuniform ($-d &lt; \alpha &lt;0$) models of two-phase media. In addition, by combining the large-$t$ asymptotic expansion of $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ with the small-$t$ expansion, we have devised a two-point Pad\'e approximant to approximate $\mathscr{s}^{ex}(t)$ for all $t$ with just a few parameters. Our findings facilitate the characterization of the microstructure of two-phase media across length scales as obtained from numerical spreadability data or experimental data obtained from NMR relaxation measurements. Our work can also be applied in the inverse design of two-phase microstructures with targeted spreadability behaviors.</description>

      <title>Long-range spin glass in a field at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the critical exponents of the zero-temperature spin glass transition in a field on a one-dimensional long-range model, a proxy for higher-dimensional systems. Our approach is based on a novel loop expansion within the Bethe $M$-layer formalism, whose adaptation to this specific case is detailed here. The resulting estimates provide crucial benchmarks for numerical simulations that can access larger system sizes in one dimension, thus offering a key test of the theory of spin glasses in a field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06386v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>
