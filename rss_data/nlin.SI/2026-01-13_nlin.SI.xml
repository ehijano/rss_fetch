      <title>Constructions of Totally Non-Negative Pfaffian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The totally non-negative pfaffian (TNNP) is define for a skew-symmetric matrix such that all the sub-pfaffians are non-negative. It appears in the pfaffian structure of $\tau$-function for the non-singular web solitons of the BKP equation . One constructs TNNP using the Perfect matching, chord diagram and the Dyck paths enumeration.Its tridiagonal form is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on lecture courses I gave to third year mathematics students at Cambridge. They could form a basis of an elementary one--term lecture course on integrable systems covering the Arnold-Liouville theorem, inverse scattering transform, Hamiltonian methods in soliton theory and Lie point symmetries. No knowledge beyond basic calculus and ordinary differential equation is assumed.</description>

      <title>Classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model: relation to Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat and 1-site classical XYZ model with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a description of the classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 8 independent coupling constants through a pair of ${\rm BC}_1$ type classical Sklyanin algebras generated by the (classical) quadratic reflection equation with non-dynamical XYZ $r$-matrix. For this purpose, we consider the classical version of the $L$-operator for the Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model proposed by O. Chalykh. In ${\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats. Each of them is described by the ${\rm BC}_1$ version of the classical Sklyanin algebra. In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants. We show that it can be reproduced by considering the transfer matrix of the classical 1-site XYZ chain with boundaries. In the end of the paper, using another gauge transformation we represent the Chalykh's Lax matrix in a form depending on the Sklyanin's generators.</description>

      <title>Self-oscillations induced by self-induced torque in magnetic double tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-oscillations of the magnetization due to self-induced torque (SIT) in a magnetic double tunnel junction that consists of perpendicularly polarized, pinned and free layers is investigated along with the field-like torque (FLT). The associated Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is numerically analysed to exhibit the oscillations of magnetization driven by the current. From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate oscillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching. Without FLT, the frequency of the oscillations decreases with the current while the power of oscillations increases. In the presence of the negative strength of the FLT the power spectral density confirms that the frequency, power and the Q-factor increase with the current. Also the tunability range and the rate at which the frequency enhances increase with the magnitude of the FLT.</description>

      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality in classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of the ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of a noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin-type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is the large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of the Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>
