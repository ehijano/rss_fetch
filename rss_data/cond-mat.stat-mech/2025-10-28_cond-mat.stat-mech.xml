      <title>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) The same findings persist in MFGL models where an $m^6$ replaces the $m^4$ term and come with simple one-period integral criteria to locate $P_c$.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-derived protocols for information-based work extraction from active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a process that extracts useful work from a single active particle maintained at constant temperature in a harmonic potential by measuring the relative sign of the self-propulsion and the confining force and then adjusting the stiffness of the potential. First, we show analytically that useful work can be extracted by stepwise changes of the stiffness. Then, we use a machine learning procedure to find time-dependent stiffness change protocols. We find that these protocols involve discontinuous initial changes of the stiffness opposite to the expected direction resembling the jumps analytically found by Garcia-Millan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 088301 (2025)] in a different information-based work extraction process. The learned protocols allow to extract significantly larger amounts of useful work. The work extracted exceeds that allowed by the second law for feedback processes, which can be rationalized by the non-equilibrium character of the system considered.</description>

      <title>Emerging correlations between diffusing particles evolving via simultaneous resetting with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of correlations between $N$ components of the position of a diffusive walker in $N$ dimensions that starts at the origin and resets to previously visited sites with certain probabilities. This is equivalent to $N$ independent one-dimensional diffusive processes starting from the origin and being subject to simultaneous resetting to positions visited in the past. Resetting follows a memory kernel that interpolates between resetting to the origin only, and the preferential relocation model, a path-dependent process which is highly non-Markov. For weak memory, the correlation coefficient between two components of the $N$-dimensional process grows monotonously with time and tends at late times to a constant bounded by $1/5$, the value corresponding to the non-equilibrium steady state of resetting to the origin. When memory is sufficiently long-ranged, the correlation is non-monotonous and reaches a maximum at a finite time before converging to its asymptotic value. These two regimes are separated by a critical memory parameter value. In the limiting case of the preferential relocation model, the components become uncorrelated at both short and long times, but the correlation vanishes logarithmically slowly at late times. The emergence of correlations through resetting can be described in a unified way in all cases by noticing that the processes are conditionally independent and identically distributed, even in the presence of memory. In the non-Markovian case, the conditioning parameter is the duration of a Brownian path composed of several parts of the full trajectory of a fixed duration $t$.</description>

      <title>Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to be canonical, its time evolution becomes identical to an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This finding provides strong evidence that, akin to general relativity where free particles follow geodesics, purely random processes also follow ``straight lines" defined by the geometry of information. This geometric principle is a direct consequence of the dually flat structure inherent to information geometry, originating from the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) leading to the violation of metric compatibility. Our results suggest a geometric foundation for randomness and open the door to an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>Entropy of the cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy of the cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction is obtained in analytical form as a function of temperature and chemical potential. A parametric equation is derived representing the entropy as a function of density. Features of both the entropy per particle and the entropy per cell are investigated at the entropy-density and entropy-chemical potential planes. The considered cell model is a multiple-occupancy model and possesses an infinite sequence of first-order phase transitions at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the entropy exhibits pronounced minima at around integer-valued particle densities, which may be a generic feature of multiple-occupancy models.</description>

      <title>Memory-controlled random bit generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing information in a microscopic system using its memory.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set approach for financial portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The portfolio optimization problem is a critical issue in asset management and has long been studied. Markowitz's mean-variance model has fundamental limitations, such as the assumption of a normal distribution for returns and sensitivity to estimation errors in input parameters. In this research, we propose a novel graph theory-based approach, the cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set (CR-WMIS) model, to overcome these limitations. The CR-WMIS model pursues the optimization of both return and risk characteristics. It integrates the risk diversification effect by selecting the largest number of weakly correlated stocks, a feature of the maximum independent set (MIS) model, with the weighting effect based on expected returns from the weighted maximum independent set (WMIS) model. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a five-year backtesting simulation (April 2019 - March 2024) using real market data from the S&amp;P 500. For this task, we employed a simulated-bifurcation-based solver for finding high-quality solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, which has not been sufficiently explored in previous MIS and WMIS studies. The results demonstrate that the CR-WMIS model exhibits superiority in both return and risk characteristics compared to the conventional MIS and WMIS models, as well as the market index (S&amp;P 500). This study provides a practical portfolio optimization method that overcomes the theoretical limitations of the mean-variance model, contributing to both the advancement of academic theory and the support of practical investment decision-making.</description>

      <title>Interrelation between precisions on integrated currents and on recurrence times in Markov jump processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Markov jump processes on irreducible networks with finite number of sites, we derive a general and explicit expression of the squared coefficient of variation for the net number of transitions from one site to a connected site in a given time window of observation (i.e., an `integrated current' as dynamical output). Such expression, which in itself is particularly useful for numerical calculations, is then elaborated to obtain the interrelation with the precision on the intrinsic timing of the recurrences of the forward and backward transitions. In biochemical ambits, such as enzyme catalysis and molecular motors, the precision on the timing is quantified by the so-called randomness parameter and the above connection is established in the long time limit of monitoring and for an irreversible site-site transition; the present extension to finite time and reversibility adds a new dimension. Some kinetic and thermodynamic inequalities are also derived.</description>

      <title>Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Temporal Complexity Hierarchies in Solvable Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>The evolution of Liouville von Neumann master equations in the Pechukas-Yukawa framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel formalism for the out of equilibrium dynamics of the density matrix, capable of describing highly entangled many-body interactions. The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Pauli Propagation: Simulating Quantum Spin Dynamics via Operator Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating real-time quantum dynamics in interacting spin systems is a fundamental challenge, where exact diagonalization suffers from exponential Hilbert-space growth and tensor-network methods face entanglement barriers. In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (OSE) $\mathcal{S}^\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</description>

      <title>Directionality-induced jamming in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffusion on multiplex networks with directed interlayer couplings. We demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even with undirected layers, interlayer directionality alone reproduces superdiffusion and the prime regime. We further reveal a new phenomenon, the directionality-induced jamming, whereby directed interlayer links hinder diffusion, fragmenting the system into dynamically disconnected components and preventing convergence to the steady state of the diffusion process. Via an optimization process, we show that this new regime is attainable in both toy models and real-world topologies. These findings underscore the crucial role of interlayer link directionality in shaping the emergent behavior of multiplex systems, with potential implications for the design and control of such systems.</description>

      <title>Wertheim association theory for ion pairing in electrolytes: effect of neutral clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of the vapor-liquid phase transition in the restricted primitive model (RPM) using Wertheim's statistical associating fluid theory to capture the effects of ion pairing which dominate the low-temperature vapor phase. For this we employ a reference system in which ion-pairing is suppressed by a judicious modification of the interaction between unlike charges from 1/r to erf(kappa r)/r, where kappa is a state-dependent parameter chosen so that the Helmholtz free energy A is at a null point (dA/d(kappa) = 0). Unlike the original RPM, this reference fluid admits real solutions to the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure of the Ornstein-Zernike equations over a wide range of densities and temperatures. In the present study, we go beyond previous work [M. Li, Ph.D. thesis, University of Manchester (2011)] to allow for isodesmic assembly of ion pairs into neutral clusters. We find this has the potential to improve significantly the agreement with the Monte-Carlo results for the RPM vapor phase boundary. We can also match recent results on anomalous underscreening in the RPM [H\"artel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 108202 (2023)] assuming that only the free ions contribute to the screening length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</description>

      <title>Ergodic behaviors in reversible 3-state cellular automata</title>

Abstract: Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of two-dimensional point vortices at order $1/N$ and $1/N^{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics. To focus on the regime of weak collective amplification, we embed these point vortices within a static background potential and soften their pairwise interaction on small scales. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. ${1/N^{2}}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.</description>

      <title>First-Passage-Time Asymmetry for Biased Run-and-Tumble Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore first-passage phenomenology for biased active processes with a renewal-type structure, focusing in particular on paradigmatic run-and-tumble models in both discrete and continuous state spaces. In general, we show there is no equality between distributions of conditional first-passage times to symmetric barriers positioned in and against the bias direction. However, we give conditions for such a duality to be restored asymptotically (in the limit of a large barrier distance) and highlight connections to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation and the method of images. Our general trajectory arguments of first-passage-time distributions for asymmetric run-and-tumble processes to escape from an interval of arbitrary width are supported by exact analytical results, which we derive extending Montroll's defect technique. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of violation of first-passage duality using Kullback-Leibler divergence and signal-to-noise ratios associated with the first-passage times to the two barriers. We reveal an intriguing dependence of such measures of first-passage asymmetry on the underlying often hidden tumbling dynamics which may inspire inference techniques based on first-passage-time statistics in active systems.</description>

Abstract: Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</description>

Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</description>

      <title>Koopman Mode Decomposition of Thermodynamic Dissipation in Nonlinear Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.</description>

      <title>Yielding in amorphous solids reveals an age-dependent intrinsic lengthscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\mathrm{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Lax dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing a substantial advantage over conventional QMC.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds for observables: Linear responses, Drude weight, and orbital magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bounds among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bounds for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, we demonstrate that bounds hold for all linear responses, which are produced by a QGT extended to many-body states, finite temperature, and general parameter space. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, we establish a bound between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bounds necessarily reflects quantum effects.</description>

      <title>General Two-Parameter Model of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>
