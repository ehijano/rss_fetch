      <title>Varifolds with capillary boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study a new class of varifolds in $\mathbf{R}^{n+1}$ of arbitrary dimensions and co-dimensions, which satisfy a Neumann-type boundary condition characterizing capillarity. The key idea is to introduce a Radon measure on a subspace of the trivial Grassmannian bundle over the supporting hypersurface as a generalized boundary with prescribed angle, which plays a role as a measure-theoretic capillary boundary. We show several structural properties, monotonicity inequality, boundary rectifiability, classification of tangent cones, and integral compactness for such varifolds under reasonable conditions. This Neumann-type boundary condition fits very well in the context of curvature varifold and Brakke flow, which we also discuss.</description>

      <title>Compactness of capillary hypersurfaces with mean curvature prescribed by ambient functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a compactness result for capillary hypersurfaces with mean curvature prescribed by ambient functions, which generalizes the results of Sch\"atzle and Bellettini to the capillary case. The proof relies on extending the definition of (unoriented) curvature varifolds with capillary boundary introduced by Wang-Zhang to the context of oriented integral varifolds. We also discuss the case when the mean curvature of the boundary is prescribed.</description>

      <title>Height estimates for surfaces with some constant curvature in $\mathbb{r} \times_{f} \mathbb{r}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the necessary equations in a conformal parameter induced by the first or second fundamental forms for a surface that is isometrically immersed in the warped product $\mathbb{R} \times_{f} \mathbb{M}^{2}(\kappa)$ where $\mathbb{M}^{2}(\kappa)$ denotes the complete, connected, simply connected, two-dimensional space form of constant curvature. The surface we will consider has either positive extrinsic curvature or positive mean curvature. In each case, we carry out some geometric applications to the theory of constant curvature surfaces immersed in $\mathbb{R} \times_{f} \mathbb{R}^{2}$ under certain conditions on the warping function $f$. Specifically, we derive height estimates for graph-type surfaces with either positive constant extrinsic curvature or positive constant mean curvature. In particular, we classify compact minimal graphs in such warped products. This article extends previous work on the study of constant curvature surfaces immersed in product spaces using conformal parameters, as well as the height estimates for constant curvature surfaces in the warped product $\mathbb{R} \times_{f} \mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>A global Morse index theorem and applications to Jacobi fields on CMC surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a "global" Morse index theorem. Given a hypersurface $M^{n}$ of constant mean curvature, immersed in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Consider a continuous deformation of "generalized" Lipschitz domain $D(t)$ enlarging in $M^{n}$. The topological type of $D(t)$ is permitted to change along $t$, so that $D(t)$ has an arbitrary shape which can "reach afar" in $M^{n}$, i.e., cover any preassigned area. The proof of the global Morse index theorem is reduced to the continuity in $t$ of the Sobolev space $H_{t}$ of variation functions on $D(t)$, as well as the continuity of eigenvalues of the stability operator. We devise a "detour" strategy by introducing a notion of "set-continuity" of $D(t)$ in $t$ to yield the required continuities of $H_{t}$ and of eigenvalues. The global Morse index theorem thus follows and provides a structural theorem of the existence of Jacobi fields on domains in $M^{n}$.</description>

Abstract: We discover an explicit construction of non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n},n\geq 3$, using a variant of ellipsoidal coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The branching set of these examples is a codimension-$2$ ellipsoid. Moreover, the graph of the related $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic one form in $T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$, can be obtained as a certain limit of a specific sequence of Lawlor's necks in $\mathbb{C}^{n}=T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Embedded constant mean curvature hypertori in the $2n$-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brendle proved Lawson conjecture about minimal embedded torus in the round three-dimensional sphere. Carlotto and Schulz constructed a minimal embedded three-dimensional hypertorus in the round four-dimensional sphere and conjectured that their hypertorus is a unique minimal embedded three-dimensional hypertorus in the round four-dimensional sphere. In this paper, we construct two different constant mean curvature embedded $(2n-1)$-dimensional hypertori (that is, topological type \(\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \times \mathbb{S}^1\)) which have the same negative mean curvature \(H\) in the round $2n$-dimensional sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{2n}(1)\) .</description>

      <title>On the topology of stable minimal hypersurfaces in a homeomorphic $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct stable minimal hypersurfaces with simple topology in certain compact $4$-manifolds $X$ with boundary, where $X$ embeds into a smooth manifold homeomorphic to $S^4$. For example, if $X$ is equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ with positive scalar curvature, we prove the existence of a stable minimal hypersurface $M$ that is diffeomorphic to either $S^3$ or a connected sum of $S^2\times S^1$'s, ruling out spherical space forms in its prime decomposition. These results imply new theorems on the topology of black holes in four dimensions. The proof involves techniques from geometric measure theory and $4$-manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Stability of the Cut Locus Under $C^2$-Perturbations of the Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the stability with respect to the Hausdorff metric $d_H$ of the cut locus $\mathrm{Cu}(p, \mathfrak{g})$ of a point $p$ in a compact Riemannian manifold $(M, \mathfrak{g})$ under $C^2$ perturbation of the metric. Specifically, given a sequence of metrics $\mathfrak{g}_i$ on $M$, converging to $\mathfrak{g}$ in the $C^2$ topology, and a sequence of points $p_i$ in $M$, converging to $p$, we show that $\lim_i d_{H}\left( \mathrm{Cu}(p_i, \mathfrak{g}_i), \mathrm{Cu}(p, \mathfrak{g}) \right) = 0$. Along the way, we also prove the continuous dependence of the cut time map on the metric.</description>

      <title>Dual pairs of generic conformally flat hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generic conformally flat (local-)hypersurfaces in the Euclidean 4-space $\mathbb{R}^4$. Such a hypersurface $f$ has the dual (hypersurface) $f^*$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which is also generic and conformally flat. By repeating the composite action of inversion and the dual transformation on a hypersurface $f$, infinitely many non-equivalent generic conformally flat hypersurfaces are obtained from a single $f$. The dual $f^*$ is defined by the total differential of the embedding expressed in terms of the original $f$. However, the exact formula in $\mathbb{R}^4$ of $f^*$ is not obvious, because of difficulty of integrating the total differential. Therefore, for the study of generic conformally flat hypersurfaces it is important to clarify in some way an explicit correspondence between the dual pair in $\mathbb{R}^4$. The aim of this paper is to clarify that correspondence between the dual pair $f$ and $f^*$, which we do by making approximate discrete hypersurfaces of $f^*$ for all positive integers $n$ as maps from $3$-dimensional nets in $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^4$. The approximations are constructed from the dual invariants of a generic conformally flat hypersurface $f$, of which dual invariants are defined as the maps from $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^4$, and as $n$ tends to $\infty$, the approximations induce maps between the corresponding curvature surfaces of $f$ and $f^*$.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores solutions to a generalised form of the Seiberg--Witten equations in higher dimensions, first introduced by Fine and the author. Starting with an oriented $n$ dimensional Riemannian manifold with a spin$^\mathbb{C}$-structure, we described an elliptic system of equations that recovers the traditional Seiberg-Witten equations in dimensions $3$ and $4$. The paper focuses on constructing explicit solutions of these equations in dimensions $5, 6$ and $8$, where harmonic perturbation terms are sometimes required to ensure solutions. In dimensions $6$ and $8$ we construct solutions on K\"ahler manifolds and relate these solutions to vortices. In dimension $5$, we construct solutions on the product of a closed Riemann surface and $\mathbb{R}^3$. The solutions are invariant in the $\mathbb{R}^3$ directions and can be related to vortices on the Riemann surface. A key issue in higher dimensions is the potential noncompactness of the space of solutions, in contrast to the compact moduli spaces in lower dimensions. In our solutions, this noncompactness is linked to the presence of certain odd-dimensional harmonic forms, with an explicit example provided in dimension $6$.</description>

      <title>Classification of gradient Einstein-type K\"ahler manifolds with $\alpha=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the ambitious project initiated by Catino, Mastrolia, Monticelli and Rigoli, which aims to provide a unified viewpoint for various geometric solitons, many classes, including Ricci solitons, Yamabe solitons, $k$-Yamabe solitons, quasi-Yamabe solitons, and conformal solitons, can now be studied under a unified framework known as Einstein-type manifolds. Einstein-type manifolds are characterized by four constants, denoted by $\alpha, \beta, \mu$ and $\rho$. In this paper, we completely classify all non-trivial, complete gradient Einstein-type K\"ahler manifolds with $\alpha = 0$. As a corollary, rotational symmetry for many classes is obtained. In particular, we show that any non-trivial complete gradient quasi-Yamabe soliton on K\"ahler manifolds is rotationally symmetric.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of chemical reaction networks: Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.
  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.
  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. Based on this result, we further prove an extension theorem for developments of weighted $H^1$ data. In particular, the weighted $H^1$ space allows H\"{o}lder continuous data. Therefore, our result is consistence with the conjecture that well-posedness holds for H\"{o}lder continuous data (with sufficiently many angular derivatives) in vacuum where the axis is included.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with singular potential. The proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails for the Yang--Mills scenario. Instead, we employ the $L^2$ method, which works for the (massless or massive) scalar matter field as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep relationship [arXiv:2503.17816v1] between real linear second order ordinary differential equations $u''\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$, with differentiable $h(x)$, and two dimensional hyperbolic geometry is generalized in a multitude of ways. First, I present an equivalent relationship in which the hyperbolic geometry is replaced by a two dimensional (anti-)de Sitter geometry. I show that this equation everywhere admits a pair of linearly independent solutions locally expressed in terms of an arbitrary non-vertical geodesic curve in this geometry. I also show that every solution of a corresponding Ricatti equation $ \Theta'\left(x\right)+\Theta^2\left(x\right)+h(x)=0$ obtained through $u'\left(x\right)=\Theta\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)$ itself is a geodesic curve in the two dimensional (anti-)de Sitter geometry.
  Next, after promoting $h(x)$ to a holomorphic function $h(z)$, I express two linearly independent solutions of $u''\left(z\right)+h\left(z\right)u\left(z\right)=0$ in virtually the same way as for the real scenario and hyperbolic geometry. In this case, the curves used to build the solutions are geodesic in a two dimensional complex Riemannian geometry of a sphere. Analogous results for the complex Ricatti equation follow. This geometric interpretation is independent of the function $h(z)$, while the holomorphic metric assumes the same functional form as the hyperbolic metric discovered in [arXiv:2503.17816v1].
  Finally, I show that the equation in question is in an equivalent relationship with four dimensional pseudo Riemannian K\"ahler-Norden geometry. The added value of working with real geometry turns out to be that certain two dimensional submanifold of the K\"ahler-Norden manifold render the hyperbolic and the (anti-)de Sitter scenario, both relevant for the real equation.</description>

      <title>Linear embeddings of grassmannians and ind-grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a grassmannian we understand a usual complex grassmannian or possibly an orthogonal or symplectic grassmannian. We classify, with few exceptions, linear embeddings of grassmannians into larger grassmannians, where the linearity requirement is the condition that the embedding induces an isomorphism on Picard groups. This classification implies that most linear embeddings of grassmannians are equivariant.
  A linear ind-grassmannian is the direct limit of a chain of linear embeddings of grassmannians. We conclude the paper by classifying linear embeddings of linear ind-grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Differential forms on diffeological spaces and diffeological gluing, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.07328v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to describe the behavior of diffeological differential forms under the operation of gluing of diffeological spaces along a smooth map. In the diffeological context, two ways of looking at diffeological forms are available, that of the vector space of all diffeological forms on a given space, and that of the pseudo-bundle of values of these forms. We describe the behavior of the former under a gluing of diffeological spaces.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates and parabolic frequency under the Laplacian G_2 flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Laplacian G_2 flow on a closed seven-dimensional manifold M with a closed G_2-structure. We first obtain the gradient estimates of positive solutions of the heat equation under the Laplacian G_2 flow and then we get the Harnack inequality on spacetime. As an application, we prove the monotonicity for positive solutions of the heat equation with bounded Ricci curvature, and get the integral-type Harnack inequality. Besides, we prove the monotonicity of parabolic frequency for positive solutions of the linear heat equation with bounded Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature, and then obtain the backward uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Sobolev Metrics on Spaces of Discrete Regular Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reparametrization invariant Sobolev metrics on spaces of regular curves have been shown to be of importance in the field of mathematical shape analysis. For practical applications, one usually discretizes the space of smooth curves and considers the induced Riemannian metric on a finite dimensional approximation space. Surprisingly, the theoretical properties of the corresponding finite dimensional Riemannian manifolds have not yet been studied in detail, which is the content of the present article. Our main theorem concerns metric and geodesic completeness and mirrors the results of the infinite dimensional setting as obtained by Bruveris, Michor and Mumford.</description>

      <title>Singularities and Topological Change for Deforming Domains in Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a $C^{0}$-deformation of domains $D(t)$ on a manifold $M^{n}$, which allows the topological types of the domains $D(t)$ to change with $t$, in what cases are the entities in analysis continuous in $t$, so that analysis techniques still work along $t$? This type of problem was addressed in our previous work [Hw] concerning domains on hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature (CMC) in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In this paper, we consider a more popular circumstance, where the deforming domains are situated in any smooth manifold $M^{n}$ equipped with an arbitrary self-adjoint strongly elliptic operator $L$ (replacing the stability operator for CMC hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ [Hw]).
  We define the concept of quasi-Lipschitz domains by gluing together some boundary points of a Lipschitz domain in a specific manner, allowing the topology of the deforming domain $D(t)$ to change. It is established that any ``appropriate" monotone $C^{0}$-deformation on $M^{n}$ (see Definition 1.1) exhibits Sobolev continuity and eigenvalue continuity of $L$ along $t$. As a consequence, a ``global" Morse index theorem is obtained. Furthermore, given an \emph{arbitrary} Lipschitz domain $D$ in $M^{n}$, we can find a $C^0$-deformation from a small $n$-ball to the domain $D$, such that the topology of $D(t)$ may change, yet the required continuity theorems still hold, and hence the global Morse index theorem still follows.</description>

      <title>Jet Functors in Noncommutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we construct three infinite families of endofunctors $J_d^{(n)}$, $J_d^{[n]}$, and $J_d^n$ on the category of left $A$-modules, where $A$ is a unital associative algebra over a commutative ring $\mathbb{k}$, equipped with an exterior algebra $\Omega^\bullet_d$. We prove that these functors generalize the corresponding classical notions of nonholonomic, semiholonomic, and holonomic jet functors, respectively. Our functors come equipped with natural transformations from the identity functor to the corresponding jet functors, which play the r\^{o}les of the classical prolongation maps. This allows us to define the notion of linear differential operators with respect to $\Omega^{\bullet}_d$. We show that if $\Omega^1_d$ is flat as a right $A$-module, the semiholonomic jet functor satisfies the semiholonomic jet exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \bigotimes^n_A \Omega^1_d \rightarrow J^{[n]}_d\rightarrow J^{[n-1]}_d \rightarrow 0$. Moreover, we construct a functor of symmetric (in a suitable noncommutative sense) forms $S^n_d$ associated to $\Omega^\bullet_d$, and proceed to introduce the corresponding noncommutative analogue of the Spencer $\delta$-complex. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the holonomic jet functor $J_d^n$ satisfies the (holonomic) jet exact sequence, $0\rightarrow S^n_d \rightarrow J_d^n \rightarrow J_d^{n-1} \rightarrow 0$. In particular, for $n=1$ the sequence is always exact, for $n=2$ it is exact for $\Omega^1_d$ flat as a right $A$-module, and for $n\ge 3$, it is sufficient to have $\Omega^1_d$, $\Omega^2_d$, and $\Omega^3_d$ flat as right $A$-modules and the vanishing of the Spencer $\delta$-cohomology $H^{\bullet,2}_{\delta_d}$.</description>

      <title>Pluriharmonic maps into buildings and symmetric differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex smooth quasi-projective variety $X$, a semisimple algebraic group $G$ defined over some non-archimedean local field $K$ and a Zariski dense representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to G(K)$, we construct a $\varrho$-equivariant (pluri-)harmonic map from the universal cover of $X$ into the Bruhat-Tits building $\Delta(G)$ of $G$, with some suitable asymptotic behavior. This theorem generalizes the previous work by Gromov-Schoen to the quasi-projective setting.
  As an application, we prove that $X$ has nonzero global logarithmic symmetric differentials if there exists a linear representation $\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_N(\mathbb{K})$ with infinite image, where $ \mathbb{K}$ is any field. This theorem generalizes the previous work by Brunebarbe, Klingler and Totaro to the quasi-projective setting.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>
