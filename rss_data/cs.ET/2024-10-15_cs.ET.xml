      <title>Gain Cell-Based Analog Content Addressable Memory for Dynamic Associative tasks in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Content Addressable Memories (aCAMs) have proven useful for associative in-memory computing applications like Decision Trees, Finite State Machines, and Hyper-dimensional Computing. While non-volatile implementations using FeFETs and ReRAM devices offer speed, power, and area advantages, they suffer from slow write speeds and limited write cycles, making them less suitable for computations involving fully dynamic data patterns. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a capacitor gain cell-based aCAM designed for dynamic processing, where frequent memory updates are required. Our system compares analog input voltages to boundaries stored in capacitors, enabling efficient dynamic tasks. We demonstrate the application of aCAM within transformer attention mechanisms by replacing the softmax-scaled dot-product similarity with aCAM similarity, achieving competitive results. Circuit simulations on a TSMC 28 nm node show promising performance in terms of energy efficiency, precision, and latency, making it well-suited for fast, dynamic AI applications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient and Fast Memristor-based Serial Multipliers Applicable in Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristive Processing In-Memory (PIM) is one of the promising techniques for overcoming the Von-Neumann bottleneck. Reduction of data transfer between processor and memory and data processing by memristors in data-intensive applications reduces energy consumption and processing time. Multipliers are one of the fundamental arithmetic circuits that play a significant role in data-intensive processing applications. The computational complexity of multipliers has turned them into one of the arithmetic circuits affecting PIM's efficiency and energy consumption, for example, in convolution operations. Serial material implication (IMPLY) logic design is one of the methods of implementing arithmetic circuits by applying emerging memristive technology that enables PIM in the structure of crossbar arrays. The authors propose unsigned and signed array multipliers using serial IMPLY logic in this paper. The proposed multipliers have improved significantly compared to State-Of-the Art (SOA) by applying the proposed Partial Product Units (PPUs) and overlapping computational steps. The number of computational steps, energy consumption, and required memristors of the proposed 8-bit unsigned array multiplier are improved by up to 36%, 31%, and 47% compared to the classic designs. The proposed 8-bit signed multiplier has also improved the computational steps, energy consumption, and required memristors by up to 59%, 54%, and 45%. The performance of the proposed multipliers in the applications of Gaussian blur and edge detection is also investigated, and the simulation results have shown an improvement of 31% in energy consumption and 33% in the number of computational steps in these applications.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Performance, Current and Future Usage of Vehicle-To-Everything Communication Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication between road users is essential for environmental perception, reasoning, and mission planning to enable fully autonomous vehicles, and thus improve road safety and transport efficiency. To enable collaborative driving, the concept of vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) has long been introduced to the industry. Within the last two decades, several communication standards have been developed based on IEEE 802.11p and cellular standards, namely Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC), Intelligent Transportation System G5 (ITS-G5), and Cellular- and New Radio- Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X and NR-V2X). However, while there exists a high quantity of available publications concerning V2X and the analysis of the different standards, only few surveys exist that summarize these results. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no survey that provides an analysis about possible future trends and challenges for the global implementation of V2Xexists. Thus, this contribution provides a detailed survey on Vehicle-to-Everything communication standards, their performance, current and future applications, and associated challenges. Based on our research, we have identified several research gaps and provide a picture about the possible future of the Vehicle-to-Everything communication domain.</description>

      <title>ZONIA: a Zero-Trust Oracle System for Blockchain IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to significant data reliability and system transparency challenges, aggravated by the centralized nature of existing IoT architectures. This centralization often results in siloed data ecosystems, where interoperability issues and opaque data handling practices compromise both the utility and trustworthiness of IoT applications. To address these issues, we introduce ZONIA (Zero-trust Oracle Network for IoT Applications), a novel blockchain oracle system designed to enhance data integrity and decentralization in IoT environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on Trusted Execution Environments and centralized data sources, ZONIA utilizes a decentralized, zero-trust model that allows for anonymous participation and integrates multiple data sources to ensure fairness and reliability. This paper outlines ZONIA's architecture, which supports semantic and geospatial queries, details its data reliability mechanisms, and presents a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating its scalability and resilience against data falsification and collusion attacks. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate ZONIA's scalability, showcasing its feasibility to handle an increasing number of nodes in the system under different system conditions and workloads. Furthermore, the implemented reputation mechanism significantly enhances data accuracy, maintaining high reliability even when 40\% of nodes exhibit malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network for Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance image reconstruction starting from undersampled k-space data requires the recovery of many potential nonlinear features, which is very difficult for algorithms to recover these features. In recent years, the development of quantum computing has discovered that quantum convolution can improve network accuracy, possibly due to potential quantum advantages. This article proposes a hybrid neural network containing quantum and classical networks for fast magnetic resonance imaging, and conducts experiments on a quantum computer simulation system. The experimental results indicate that the hybrid network has achieved excellent reconstruction results, and also confirm the feasibility of applying hybrid quantum-classical neural networks into the image reconstruction of rapid magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to avoid repeated task offloading and realize the reuse of popular task computing results, we construct a novel content caching-assisted vehicular edge computing (VEC) framework. In the face of irregular network topology and unknown environmental dynamics, we further propose a multi-agent graph attention reinforcement learning (MGARL) based edge caching scheme, which utilizes the graph attention convolution kernel to integrate the neighboring nodes' features of each agent and further enhance the cooperation among agents. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme is capable of improving the utilization of caching resources while reducing the long-term task computing latency compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>From x*y=k to Uniswap Hooks; A Comparative Review of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are pivotal applications in the Decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, aiming to facilitate trustless cryptocurrency trading by relying on smart contracts and blockchain networks. The developments in the DEXs sector began with the implementation of an automated market maker (AMM) system using a simple math formula by Uniswap V1 in 2018. Absorbing significant funding and the attention of web3 enthusiasts, DEXs have seen numerous advancements in their evolution. A notable recent advancement is the introduction of hooks in Uniswap v4, which allows users to take advantage of a wide range of plugin-like features with liquidity pools. This paper provides a comprehensive classification and comparative analyses of prominent DEX protocols, namely Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer, in addition to investigating other protocols' noteworthy aspects. The evaluation framework encompasses mechanisms, components, mathematical formulations, and the performance of liquidity pools. The goals are to elucidate the strengths and limitations of different AMM models, highlight emerging concepts in DEX development, outline current challenges, and differentiate optimal models for specific applications. The results and comparative insights can be a reference for web3 developers, blockchain researchers, traders, and regulatory parties.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Input-Output Causality Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of reflexive actuation, examining how robots may leverage both internal and external stimuli to trigger changes in the motion, performance, or physical characteristics of the robot, such as its size, shape, or configuration, and so on. These changes themselves may in turn be sequentially re-used as input to drive further adaptations. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, where reflexes are an essential component of the response to environmental changes, reflexive actuation is critical to enable robots to adapt to diverse situations and perform complex tasks. The underlying principles of reflexive actuation are analyzed, with examples provided from existing implementations such as contact-sensitive reflexive arms, physical counters, and their applications. The paper also outlines future directions and challenges for advancing this research area, emphasizing its significance in the development of adaptive, responsive robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Fully Programmable Spatial Photonic Ising Machine by Focal Plane Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in non von Neumann hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world has recently witnessed an unprecedented acceleration in demands for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications. This spike in demand has imposed tremendous strain on the underlying technology stack in supply chain, GPU-accelerated hardware, software, datacenter power density, and energy consumption. If left on the current technological trajectory, future demands show insurmountable spending trends, further limiting market players, stifling innovation, and widening the technology gap. To address these challenges, we propose a fundamental change in the AI training infrastructure throughout the technology ecosystem. The changes require advancements in supercomputing and novel AI training approaches, from high-end software to low-level hardware, microprocessor, and chip design, while advancing the energy efficiency required by a sustainable infrastructure. This paper presents the analytical framework that quantitatively highlights the challenges and points to the opportunities to reduce the barriers to entry for training large language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum theory over discrete systems is extended in two significant ways. First, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over entire network configurations, so that nodes may find themselves in a quantum superposition of being connected or not, and be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. Second, tensors and traceouts are generalized, so that systems can be partitioned according to almost arbitrary logical predicates in a robust manner. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the neighbourhood and partitioning between systems become both quantum, dynamical, and logical. Such interrelations in fact carry through, albeit two new notions become instrumental: consistency and comprehension.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05754v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks with residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognition. We explain the concrete frameworks and illustrate the potential superiority to prevent gradient explosion of our hybrid models. A group of numerical experiments about generalization power shows that our hybrid models possess the same generalization power as the pure classical models with different noisy datasets utilized. More importantly, another group of numerical experiments of robustness demonstrates that our hybrid models outperform pure classical models notably in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Also, an ablation study indicate that the recognition accuracy of our hybrid models is 2\%-3\% higher than that of the quantum neural network without residual or dense connection. Eventually, we discuss the application scenarios of our hybrid models by analyzing their computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state Hamiltonian H to achieve this, which conforms to the constraints of Zero mean energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in terms of energy retrieval. Though the Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) model demonstrates a similar result achieving an average efficiency of 32.5% (observing only V ), the Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) model shows a significantly higher result than that of the 2-qubit system considering practical usage, which is 58.2%</description>

Abstract: The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of application-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth. A 4 $\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used to perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the performance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%. This work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a foundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.</description>
