      <title>BWT construction and search at the terabase scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a common component in full-text indices. Initially developed for data compression, it is particularly powerful for encoding redundant sequences such as pangenome data. However, BWT construction is resource intensive and hard to be parallelized, and many methods for querying large full-text indices only report exact matches or their simple extensions. These limitations have hampered the biological applications of full-text indices.
  Results: We developed ropebwt3 for efficient BWT construction and query. Ropebwt3 could index 100 assembled human genomes in 21 hours and index 7.3 terabases of commonly studied bacterial assemblies in 26 days. This was achieved using 82 gigabytes of memory at the peak without working disk space. Ropebwt3 can find maximal exact matches and inexact alignments under affine-gap penalties, and can retrieve all distinct local haplotypes matching a query sequence. It demonstrates the feasibility of full-text indexing at the terabase scale.

      <title>Toward Capturing Genetic Epistasis From Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Studies Using Mixed-Precision Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the widening margin in tensor-core performance between [FP64/FP32/FP16/INT8,FP64/FP32/FP16/FP8/INT8] on NVIDIA [Ampere,Hopper] GPUs to boost the performance of output accuracy-preserving mixed-precision computation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of 305K patients from the UK BioBank, the largest-ever GWAS cohort studied for genetic epistasis using a multivariate approach. Tile-centric adaptive-precision linear algebraic techniques motivated by reducing data motion gain enhanced significance with low-precision GPU arithmetic. At the core of Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) techniques for GWAS lie compute-bound cubic-complexity matrix operations that inhibit scaling to aspirational dimensions of the population, genotypes, and phenotypes. We accelerate KRR matrix generation by redesigning the computation for Euclidean distances to engage INT8 tensor cores while exploiting symmetry.We accelerate solution of the regularized KRR systems by deploying a new four-precision Cholesky-based solver, which, at 1.805 mixed-precision ExaOp/s on a nearly full Alps system, outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-only REGENIE GWAS software by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Categorization and analysis of 14 computational methods for estimating cell potency from single-cell RNA-seq data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, a key challenge is inferring hidden cellular dynamics from static cell snapshots. Various computational methods have been developed to address this, focusing on perspectives like pseudotime trajectories, RNA velocities, and estimating the differentiation potential of cells, often referred to as "cell potency." This review summarizes 14 methods for defining cell potency from scRNA-seq data, categorizing them into average-based, entropy-based, and correlation-based methods based on how they summarize gene expression levels into a potency measure. We highlight the key similarities and differences within and between these categories, offering a high-level intuition for each method. Additionally, we use unified mathematical notations to detail each method's methodology and summarize their usage complexities, including parameters, required inputs, and differences between published descriptions and software implementations. We conclude that cell potency estimation remains an open question without a consensus on the optimal approach, emphasizing the need for benchmark datasets and studies. This review aims to provide a foundation for future benchmark studies, while also addressing the broader challenge of comparing methods that infer cellular dynamics from scRNA-seq data through various perspectives, including pseudotime trajectories, RNA velocities, and cell potency.</description>
