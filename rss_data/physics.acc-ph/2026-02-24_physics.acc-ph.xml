      <title>Nanometer-scale pre-bunched electron beams generated from all-optical plasma-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality and prebunched electron beams can produce coherent x-rays with high intensity and narrow bandwidth, which is essential for modern light sources. An all-optical scheme based on plasma-based acceleration to produce bright electron beams that are pre-bunched on nanometer-scales is proposed. By using a density modulation created by two low intensity counter-propagating lasers, the phase velocity of the plasma wake excited by an intense driver laser in a uniform plasma can be modulated at a frequency twice that of the colliding lasers and thus turn the injection on and off. The injected electrons are micro-bunched at the Doppler shifted wavelength of the modulated wavelength using the corresponding phase velocity of the gradual expansion of the wakefield. It is demonstrated that by controlling the properties of the drive and colliding lasers, that beams with exotic pre-bunched structures can be produced, which may have critical applications in ultrafast high power x-rays. This extremely compact, all-optical scheme to produce ultra-bright pre-bunched electron beams may therefore enable novel applications for ultrafast x-ray users and arouse general interest in various fields.</description>

      <title>Conventional Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This course introduces conventional magnets used in particle accelerators, focusing on both normal-conducting copper coil magnets and permanent magnets (PMs). It covers magnet classification, design principles, material selection, and mechanical constraints. Advantages and limitations of PMs compared to copper coil magnets are discussed. Key construction steps and cooling methods are presented. The course also includes magnetic field measurement techniques and quality control. Practical examples from PSI and CERN illustrate the concepts.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This course introduces key aspects of superconducting magnet technology in accelerators: basic principles, superconducting materials (NbTi, Nb$_3$Sn, ReBCO), wire and cable architectures, and fabrication methods. Compared to copper or permanent magnets, superconducting systems require cryogenics and complex protection schemes but enable superior performance. Core challenges - like flux pinning, magnetization effects, quench behavior, mechanical forces interception, power tests and magnetic measurements - are addressed through examples of magnets from PSI and CERN.</description>

      <title>SHARP: A compact focusing system for medical applications using a diverging plasma lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer therapy for deep-seated tumors requires precise irradiation of a small target deep within the patient while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. This can be accomplished with a round beam sharply converging towards a single spot, requiring a large beam size in both planes at the exit of the focusing system. Achieving this over a short distance using only quadrupole lenses is challenging; but by using a linear active plasma lens (APL) in defocusing mode, the beam can be quickly and non-destructively enlarged before focusing using quadrupoles. The position of the irradiation spot can also be scanned in three dimensions by changing magnet settings. The SHARP project will develop and test this concept. Such a system can be used with very high energy electrons (hundreds of MeV), creating a Bragg-peak-like spot using novel accelerator technology. This could lead to more compact radiotherapy facilities, not requiring a bulky infrastructure typically associated with proton radiotherapy machines. If successful, SHARP will enable precision conformal radiotherapy, spatial fractionation, and potentially be useful for FLASH radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Elaboration on the kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko to spin-polarized beams in electron storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed account of the kinetic approach for describing the effect of synchrotron radiation on electron and positron spin polarization in storage rings. This approach was introduced in 1974 by Derbenev and Kondratenko and was extended by us since 2001. The kinetic approach is much less frequently utilized but it is more general than the original non-kinetic approach of Derbenev and Kondratenko from 1972 since the kinetic approach is not centered on the invariant spin field. As with the non-kinetic approach the kinetic approach covers the radiative depolarization effect, the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov correction as well as the kinetic polarization effect but it enables the calculation of corrections to the original Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas and thereby provides estimates of the reliability of the latter. The kinetic approach is applicable to storage rings with energies from a few GeV up to the energies of the FCC-ee and CEPC and beyond. The kinetic approach is based on the spin-orbit Wigner functions which lead to the so-called Bloch equation for the polarization density which is a generalization of Fokker-Planck equations to spin motion. In turn, as discovered in 2019, the Bloch equation is based on stochastic ordinary differential equations which can be used to develop Monte-Carlo spin tracking codes covering the key effects beyond the radiative depolarization effect. These stochastic ordinary differential equations lead to a new viewpoint of the physical effects, in particular the kinetic polarization effect.</description>

      <title>Application of RFSoC Technology for Beam Position Monitors at the SuperKEKB Storage Rings Injection Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to achieve its ambitious luminosity target, the SuperKEKB collider must achieve and sustain high beam currents on the order of Ampere in its storage rings. This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications. This paper is concerned with the details of this development as well as evaluation and operation of the developed device.</description>
