      <title>Transportation Technology and Gentrification: Evidence from the entry of Ridesharing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the staggered entry of rideshare services across U.S. metropolitan areas, estimating its effect on the spatial redistribution and real outcomes of residents. Ridesharing services gentrify urban areas-especially those with ex-ante lower housing values-causing housing prices to rise 9 percent, with the in-migration of rich-younger individuals more than offsetting the out-migration of incumbent residents and reduced in-migration of poorer individuals. Impact on incumbent residents is conditional on ex-ante homeownership. For homeowners, there is no displacement and a decline in delinquency rates. For non-homeowners, displacement and delinquency rates rise 11 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Our study emphasizes how the private provision of high-end transportation technologies can increase urbanization and exacerbate inequality.</description>

Abstract: Economics Job Market Rumors (EJMR) is an online forum and clearinghouse for information on the academic job market for economists. It also includes content that is abusive, defamatory, racist, misogynistic, or otherwise "toxic." Almost all of this content is created anonymously by contributors who receive a four-character username when posting on EJMR. Using only publicly available data we show that the statistical properties of the scheme by which these usernames were generated allows the IP addresses from which most posts were made to be determined with high probability. We recover 47,630 distinct IP addresses of EJMR posters and attribute them to 66.1% of the roughly 7 million posts made over the past 12 years. We geolocate posts and describe aggregated cross-sectional variation -- particularly regarding toxic, misogynistic, and hate speech -- across sub-forums, geographies, institutions, and IP addresses. Our analysis suggests that content on EJMR comes from all echelons of the economics profession, including, but not limited to, its elite institutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal longevity of a dynasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The welfare of a dynasty that consists of identical Bernoullian utilities subject to Cobb-Douglas production with constant labor is maximized. We blend two discounting schemes to avoid the objective function from exploding to infinity: one is the compound discounting of future utilities and the other is the binary discounting which undiscounts utilities before the planning horizon but fully discounts those that lie beyond. After presenting a general solution to the optimal schedule of consumption, we study the planning solution analytically and also numerically, to discover that the optimal planning horizon is not necessarily an infinity, even under the case of zero compound discounting. Furthermore, we study the inequality of consumptions among generations with respect to the compound discount rates and planning horizons.</description>

      <title>Semi-strong Efficient Market of Bitcoin and Twitter: an Analysis of Semantic Vector Spaces of Extracted Keywords and Light Gradient Boosting Machine Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the examination of the Efficient-Market Hypothesis in Bitcoin market during a five year fluctuation period, from September 1 2017 to September 1 2022, by analyzing 28,739,514 qualified tweets containing the targeted topic "Bitcoin". Unlike previous studies, we extracted fundamental keywords as an informative proxy for carrying out the study of the EMH in the Bitcoin market rather than focusing on sentiment analysis, information volume, or price data. We tested market efficiency in hourly, 4-hourly, and daily time periods to understand the speed and accuracy of market reactions towards the information within different thresholds. A sequence of machine learning methods and textual analyses were used, including measurements of distances of semantic vector spaces of information, keywords extraction and encoding model, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifiers. Our results suggest that 78.06% (83.08%), 84.63% (87.77%), and 94.03% (94.60%) of hourly, 4-hourly, and daily bullish (bearish) market movements can be attributed to public information within organic tweets.</description>

      <title>Global Stock Market Volatility Forecasting Incorporating Dynamic Graphs and All Trading Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a global stock market volatility forecasting model that enhances forecasting accuracy and practical utility in real-world financial decision-making by integrating dynamic graph structures and encompassing the union of active trading days of different stock markets. The model employs a spatial-temporal graph neural network (GNN) architecture to capture the volatility spillover effect, where shocks in one market spread to others through the interconnective global economy. By calculating the volatility spillover index to depict the volatility network as graphs, the model effectively mirrors the volatility dynamics for the chosen stock market indices. In the empirical analysis, the proposed model surpasses the benchmark model in all forecasting scenarios and is shown to be sensitive to the underlying volatility interrelationships.</description>

      <title>The Pay and Non-Pay Content of Job Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How informative are job ads about the actual pay and amenities offered by employers? Using a comprehensive database of job ads posted by Norwegian employers, we develop a methodology to systematically classify the information on both pay and non-pay job attributes advertised in vacancy texts. We link this information to measures of employer attractiveness, which we derive from a job search model estimated on observed wages and worker mobility flows. About 55 percent of job ads provide information related to pay and nearly all ads feature information on non-pay attributes. We show that publicly advertised job attributes are meaningful predictors of employer attractiveness, and non-pay attributes are about as predictive as pay-related attributes. High-pay employers mention pay-related attributes more often, while high-amenity employers are more likely to advertise flexible working hours and contract duration.</description>

      <title>Does Ownership Structure Matter? A Case Study on Business Performance of Two Accounting Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many public organisations procure a substantial amount of goods and services from in-house companies. When providing their goods and services, those companies are supposed to fulfil objectives set for them and for the wider entity, including in particular cost-effectiveness. This paper examines the performance of selected in-house companies both by analyzing the externally reported financial performance (top-down) and analyzing the internal operations and related performance (bottom-up). Based on the analysis, it is discussed, 1) how the in-house companies fulfil their assigned tasks as publicly owned entities and 2) how these in-house companies and their performance should be controlled by public bodies. Methodologically the paper takes advantage of two cases of accounting companies: one publicly owned in-house company and another private company. As a conclusion, in this case top-down analysis reveals inefficiencies which are further explored via bottom-up analysis. In this case, privatization leads to enhanced business performance.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting of Real-Time Electricity Market Signals via Interpretable Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generative AI approach to probabilistic forecasting of real-time electricity market signals, including locational marginal prices, interregional price spreads, and demand-supply imbalances. We present WIAE-GPF, a Weak Innovation AutoEncoder-based Generative Probabilistic Forecasting architecture that generates future samples of multivariate time series. Unlike traditional black-box models, WIAE-GPF offers interpretability through the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation for nonparametric time series, making it a nonparametric generalization of the Wiener/Kalman filter-based forecasting. A novel learning algorithm with structural convergence guarantees is proposed, ensuring that, under ideal training conditions, the generated forecast samples match the ground truth conditional probability distribution. Extensive tests using publicly available data from U.S. independent system operators under various point and probabilistic forecasting metrics demonstrate that WIAE-GPF consistently outperforms classical methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Does AI help humans make better decisions? A methodological framework for experimental evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today's society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a new methodological framework to experimentally answer this question without additional assumptions. We measure a decision maker's ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded experimental design, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is randomized across cases with humans making final decisions. Under this experimental design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems -- human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. We also show when to provide a human-decision maker with AI recommendations and when they should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to the data from our own randomized controlled trial of a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge's decision to impose cash bail. Our analysis also shows that the risk assessment-alone decisions generally perform worse than human decisions with or without algorithmic assistance.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratified estimator, post-stratified estimator, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate unbiased estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a randomly sampled holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Earth-Intelligence-Lab/uncertainty-quantification.</description>
