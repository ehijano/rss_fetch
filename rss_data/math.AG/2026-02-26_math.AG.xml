      <title>A \v{C}ech--Stokes Pushout Groupoid: a Log/Kummer Betti Presenter for Stokes Torsors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold and let $D\subset X$ be a simple normal crossings divisor. Fix a Kummer level $n\ge 1$ and an irregular type $\Phi$ along $D$, and consider the logarithmic Betti boundary $X^{\log}_n$ (the level-$n$ Kato--Nakayama space). We construct a strictly $1$-categorical, cover-based Betti presenter for Stokes torsors by building a small strict \v{C}ech--Stokes collar groupoid on a punctured logarithmic collar of $D$, together with a canonical projection $\pi$ to the underlying sector \v{C}ech groupoid. The central observation is that the appropriate collar Stokes moduli is the groupoid of strict functorial sections $\operatorname{Sec}(\pi)$ (equivalently, $\mathrm{St}_{\Phi}$-torsors on the sector cover), yielding a fully explicit presenter that remains small and strictly functorial. We then glue the collar presenter to the ordinary \v{C}ech presenter of $U:=X\setminus D$ through a strict diagram of small groupoids and an explicit $2$-pushout presenter $G_{\Phi,n}$. We prove that global Stokes objects, defined intrinsically as a $2$-fiber product, are computed by a strict torsorial gluing problem, i.e.\ by Stokes-corrected torsorial representations of $G_{\Phi,n}$. In arbitrary SNC depth we solve the local corner presentation problem by an explicit chamber-complex model on the angular torus: Stokes torsors are nonabelian cocycles on the $1$-skeleton with relations read off from $2$-cells. The overall construction is canonical up to Morita equivalence with a contractible space of identifications (invariant under stratified subdivision), and it is compatible with Kummer descent along all normal crossings strata via $(\mu_n)^k$-equivariant local models and descent to homotopy fixed points.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory of $\mathbb{E}_n$-Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the naive deformation problem of an $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal stable $k$-linear $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is a $2$-proximate formal $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-moduli problem, whose corresponding formal moduli problem is controlled by the non-unital $\mathbb{E}_{n+2}$-algebra $\mathrm{fib}\big(\mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})}(1)\rightarrow \mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{C}}(1)\big)$, where $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathbb{E}_n}(\mathcal{C})$ is the $\mathbb{E}_n$-center of $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid monoidal and tamely compactly generated by unobstructible objects, then this naive deformation problem is equivalent to the formal moduli problem. We also prove a uniqueness theorem for formal deformations of certain formal moduli problems, which can be applied to the $\mathbb{E}_1$ and $\mathbb{E}_2$-monoidal deformation problems of $\mathbf{Rep}(G)$ for a reductive algebraic group $G$ with a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=T_e G$.</description>

      <title>Topology of projective Tate-Shafarevich twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Tate-Shafarevich twist $X^\phi\to B$ of a fibration $X\to B$ modifies it by a $1$-cocycle of flows of vector fields relative to the base, locally in the analytic topology. Sacc\`a conjectured that the total spaces of two projective Lagrangian fibrations related by such a twist are deformation-equivalent.
  Assuming that the class of the twist is torsion (which is often equivalent to the twist being realizable in the \'etale topology), we show that there is an isomorphism $H^\ast(X;\mathbb Q)\cong H^\ast(X^\phi;\mathbb Q)$ of graded vector spaces that respects (1) the Hodge structures and (2) the Hodge-Riemann pairing. Consequently, the rational Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki lattices of these two spaces are Hodge-similar.
  Assuming further that $B$ is smooth, that the fibers of the fibrations are reduced outside of a locus of codimension $2$ in $B$, and that the integral homology classes of a general fiber in both spaces are primitive, we show Sacc\`a's conjecture using a recent result of Bogomolov-Kamenova-Verbitsky. We also show that Beauville-Mukai systems for primitive classes satisfy the last condition.</description>

      <title>An Effective Criterion for Covering Maps Between Real Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a quasi-finite, flat morphism with locally constant geometric fibers between varieties over a real closed field induces a covering map on the rational points. This serves as an effective criteria for covering maps, as we show that these conditions can be checked by the algorithms developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Neural Learning of Fast Matrix Multiplication Algorithms: A StrassenNet Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast matrix multiplication can be described as searching for low-rank decompositions of the matrix--multiplication tensor. We design a neural architecture, \textsc{StrassenNet}, which reproduces the Strassen algorithm for $2\times 2$ multiplication. Across many independent runs the network always converges to a rank-$7$ tensor, thus numerically recovering Strassen's optimal algorithm. We then train the same architecture on $3\times 3$ multiplication with rank $r\in\{19,\dots,23\}$. Our experiments reveal a clear numerical threshold: models with $r=23$ attain significantly lower validation error than those with $r\le 22$, suggesting that $r=23$ could actually be the smallest effective rank of the matrix multiplication tensor $3\times 3$.
  We also sketch an extension of the method to border-rank decompositions via an $\varepsilon$--parametrisation and report preliminary results consistent with the known bounds for the border rank of the $3\times 3$ matrix--multiplication tensor.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative crepant resolutions for (almost) simplicial toric algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a rational convex polyhedral Gorenstein cone constructed as cone over a lattice polytope P, we establish that toric non-commutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs) of its associated toric algebra descend to toric NCCRs of the algebras associated to faces of the polytope P. As consequence, we present two new, short proofs to the existence of toric NCCRs for simplicial affine toric Gorenstein algebras and for almost simplicial affine toric Gorenstein algebras, i.e. those associated to cones $\sigma$ with $\dim\sigma+1$ extremal rays.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of certain curves and surfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate combinatorial bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of plane curve arrangements. Focusing on arrangements of lines and conics in $\mathbb{P}^2$ that admit only ordinary quasi-homogeneous singularities, we derive new structural inequalities governing the distribution of multiple intersection points. As a consequence, we establish sharp lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of free line arrangements with bounded maximal multiplicity and, more generally, for free conic-line arrangements. In particular, we show that for a free arrangement of $d$ lines and $k$ conics, the total Tjurina number grows at least quadratically in $d$ and $k$, and we demonstrate that this bound is sharp. As an application, we construct a particular family of surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with only isolated singularities having arbitrarily large total Tjurina numbers. This provides new lower bounds for the total Tjurina numbers of certain hypersurfaces that are independent of detailed homological data.</description>

      <title>Pure extension of the theta divisor over the moduli space of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theta divisor on the universal principally polarised abelian variety can be extended to a compactification either by taking the Zariski closure, or by taking the unique extension which is pure of weight 2. For the latter, following ideas of Yuan and Zhang, we need to pass to the category of adelic- or b-divisors. We show that the two choices of extension differ by a tropicalisation of the Riemann theta function. We prove an extension of Moret-Bailly's ''key formula'' that features the pure weight 2 extension of the theta divisor, and discuss various arithmetic applications, including a ''universal'' formula for the N\'eron--Tate height of a point. A key technical input is the systematic use of the theory of logarithmic abelian varieties due to Kajiwara, Kato, and Nakayama.</description>

      <title>Geometry of two- and three-dimensional integrable systems related to affine Weyl groups $W(E_8^{(1)})$ and $W(E_7^{(1)})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find a general framework for the construction of birational involutions on two- and three-dimensional varieties obtained from $\mathbb P^2$, $\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$, and $\mathbb P^3$ by blow-up at nine, respectively eight points. Each such involution is based on a divisor class with a one-dimensional linear system with a generic element of genus zero. Classical Manin involutions represent the simplest particular case. Novel, more sophisticated cases identified here include birational involutions of $\mathbb P^2$ along conics and along nodal cubic curves, as well as birational involutions of $\mathbb P^3$ along quadratic cones and along Cayley nodal cubic surfaces. We prove a general formula for the induced action of geometric birational involutions on the respective Picard group, and give a general result about decomposition of translational elements of the respective affine Weyl group of symmetries into a product of two geometric birational involutions.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of symplectic $T^n$ - reductions and compactifications of $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symplectic $T^n$ - reduction on a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$ for the canonical action of the maximal compact torus depends on the $S_n$ - orbit of a maximal chamber in a hypersimplex $\Delta _{n,2}$. The chamber decomposition of $\Delta _{n,2}$ is defined by the admissible polytopes, which can be realized as matroids. In our previous work we described this chamber decomposition by means of the hyperplane arrangement. It is important to note that to any chamber it corresponds the compact space, which is a smooth compact manifold for a chamber of maximal dimension. In this paper we obtain explicit description of the cohomology rings of the symplectic $T^n$ - reductions on $G_{n,2}$ for the standard moment map in terms of the chamber decomposition of $\Delta _{n,2}$ and the well known results of Kirwan and Goldin.
  We recently introduced the Hassett category whose objects are special compactifications of the space $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$. The initial object in this category is the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$. In this paper we describe the cohomology rings of various compactifications for $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$, which correspond to the objects of the Hassett category. Our results show that even in the case $n=5$ there are objects in the Hassett category with different cohomology rings.</description>

Abstract: We construct an infinite family of quartic del Pezzo surfaces over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ with no quadratic points, for all primes $p\neq 2$. This answers a question of Colliot--Th\'el\`ene, Creutz and Viray in the negative, which asks whether every quartic del Pezzo surface has quadratic points over $C_2$ fields. We exhibit a Brauer--Manin obstruction on the variety parametrising lines associated to the quartic del Pezzo surface.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a perverse sheaf on a connected commutatitve algebraic group over a finite is generically unramified. This implies an equidistribution theorem for Tannakian monodromy groups in previously unavailable generality. We also prove a stratification theorem for exponential sums in families indexed by a scheme and the characters of a connected commutative algebraic group. Our method is based on Tannakian categories introduced by Gabber and Loeser. This method naturally yields fiber functors. We also prove vanishing theorems over a connected commutative algebraic group, classify the negligible sheaves, and prove relative weak propagation theorems for tori.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a q-deformation of the p-adic regulator of a number field, called the cyclosyntomic regulator, building on the Habiro ring of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier. The key new ingredient in our construction is a refinement of Sulyma's norm maps in prismatic cohomology, which interpolate between classical powers and Frobenius maps at various prime numbers p. Furthermore, we compute the values of the cyclosyntomic regulator at units of the form $1-\zeta$, where $\zeta$ is a root of unity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups through the geometry of infinite-level unitary Shimura varieties and the Hodge-Tate period map. We first develop a perfectoid construction of overconvergent automorphic forms. Building on this, we establish a canonical overconvergent Eichler-Shimura map linking overconvergent cohomology to these $p$-adic automorphic forms. This map induces a comparison between the corresponding coherent sheaves on the eigenvariety, with applications to the study of its geometry and to $p$-adic $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of local cohomology in unramified mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an ideal $I$ in a regular local ring $A$, the cohomological dimension of $I$ in $A$ is the index of the highest non-vanishing local cohomology of $A$ supported at $I$. Determining effective upper bounds on the cohomological dimension in terms of topological invariants of $\text{Spec}(A/I)$ is a central problem in commutative algebra. In equal characteristic, Faltings proved in 1980 a general bound on the cohomological dimension of an ideal in terms of its big height. In this article, we extend Faltings' result to the unramified mixed characteristic setting and show that the resulting bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>Beyond twisted arcs: a McKay correspondence for reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural generalization of twisted maps, called \emph{warped maps}. While twisted maps play an important role in the study of Deligne--Mumford stacks, warped maps are better suited for studying Artin stacks. Heuristically, warped maps see the hidden proper-like behavior satisfied by good moduli space maps. Specifically, we show that every arc of a good moduli space admits a \emph{canonical} lift, in a warped sense, thereby proving a valuative criterion for good moduli spaces. Furthermore, we prove that warped maps to an Artin stack $\mathcal{X}$ are given by usual maps to an auxiliary Artin stack $\mathscr{W}(\mathcal{X})$, immediately obtaining a versatile framework for bootstrapping results about usual maps to the setting of warped maps. As an application we obtain a motivic change of variables formula which, given a stacky resolution of singularities $\mathcal{X} \to Y$, canonically expresses any given motivic integral over arcs of $Y$ as a certain motivic integral over warped arcs of $\mathcal{X}$. In particular, this yields a McKay correspondence for linearly reductive groups.</description>

      <title>A perturbative construction of primitive forms from log Landau-Ginzburg mirrors of toric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a logarithmic Landau-Ginzburg (log LG) model, which is essentially given by equipping the central degenerate fiber of the family of Landau-Ginzburg (LG) models mirror to a projective toric manifold with a natural log structure. We show that the state space of the mirror log LG model is naturally isomorphic to that of the original toric manifold. Following Li-Li-Saito, we give a perturbative construction of primitive forms by studying the deformation theory of such a log LG model, which involves both smoothing of the central degenerate fiber and unfolding of the superpotential. This yields a logarithmic Frobenius manifold structure on the base space of the universal unfolding. The primitive forms and flat coordinates we obtained are computable and closely related to the bulk-deformed Lagrangian Floer superpotential of a projective toric manifold, at least in the semi-Fano case.</description>

      <title>Osculating Geometry and Higher-Order Distance Loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of optimizing the distance function from a given point, subject to polynomial constraints. A key algebraic invariant that governs its complexity is the Euclidean distance degree, which pertains to first-order tangency. We focus on the data locus of points possessing at least one critical point of the distance function that is normal to a higher-order osculating space. We study the higher-order distance degree of a morphism as an intersection-theoretic invariant involving jet bundles and higher-order polar classes. Our approach builds on foundational definitions and results developed by Piene, particularly regarding higher-order polar loci. We give closed formulas for generic maps, Veronese embeddings, and toric embeddings. We place particular emphasis on the Bombieri-Weyl metric, revealing that the chosen metric profoundly influences both the degree and birationality of the higher-order projection maps. Additionally, we introduce a tropical framework that represents these degrees as stable intersections with Bergman fans, facilitating effective combinatorial computation in toric settings.</description>

      <title>On the Nash Problem over 3-Fold Terminal Singularities of Type cAx/2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Nash valuations on 3-fold terminal singularities, especially in type cAx/2. We find that, in type cAx/2, exceptional prime divisors computing the minimal discrepancy (which is 1/2 in this case) induce Nash valuations. We conjecture this in general for all 3-fold terminal singularities, and provide some evidence in the Gorenstein case.</description>

      <title>Angular pair-of-pants decompositions of complex varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of torically hyperbolic varieties and we construct pair-of-pants decompositions for these in terms of angle sets of essential projective hyperplane complements. This construction generalizes the classical pair-of-pants decomposition for hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In our first main theorem, we prove that the natural angle map associated to an essential projective hyperplane complement is a homotopy equivalence, extending earlier work of Salvetti and Bj\"orner-Ziegler. By a topological argument, we further show that the angle map for a finite Kummer covering of an essential projective hyperplane complement is likewise a homotopy equivalence. We then explain how these local building blocks can be glued along the dual intersection complex of a semistable degeneration. Using the theory of Kato-Nakayama spaces, we prove that the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the original algebraic variety. We make this explicit for complete intersections in projective space using techniques from tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Towards Monoidal Categorifications of Twisted Products of Flag Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply connected, simply laced algebraic group. We construct a monoidal category of representations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ whose Grothendieck ring contains a cluster algebra with initial seed given by that of the coordinate ring of twisted products of flag varieties. This class of varieties includes, in particular, braid varieties and reduced double Bruhat cells.</description>
