      <title>The Monge-Ampere system in dimension two: a further regularity improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a convex integration result for the Monge-Amp\`ere system, in case of dimension $d=2$ and arbitrary codimension $k\geq 1$. Our prior result stated flexibility up to the H\"older regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{1}{1+ 4/k}}$, whereas presently we achieve flexibility up to $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ when $k\geq 4$ and up to $\mathcal{C}^{1,\frac{2^k-1}{2^{k+1}-1}}$ for any $k$. This first result uses the approach of K\"allen, while the second result iterates on the approach of Cao-Hirsch-Inauen and agrees with it for $k=1$ at the H\"older regularity up to $\mathcal{C}^{1,1/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several types of self-similar solutions for the electron magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without resistivity, including locally self-similar solutions and pseudo-self-similar solutions. We show that under certain conditions, these types of self-similar blowup solutions can be excluded.</description>

      <title>Singular velocity of the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations near boundary in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local behaviors near boundary are analyzed for solutions of the Stokes and Navier-Stoke equations in the half space with localized non-smooth boundary data. We construct solutions of Stokes equations whose velocity field is not bounded near boundary away from the support of boundary data, although velocity and gradient velocity of solutions are locally square integrable. This is an improvement compared to known results in the sense that velocity field is unbounded itself, since previously constructed solutions were bounded near boundary, although their normal derivatives are singular. We also establish singular solutions and their derivatives that do not belong to $L^q_{\rm{loc}}$ near boundary with $q&gt; 1$. For such examples, there corresponding pressures turn out not to be locally integrable. Similar construction via a perturbation argument is available to the Navier-Stokes equations near boundary as well.</description>

      <title>On the Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with or without Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for compressible current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results of this paper are two-fold: First, we establish the zero-surface-tension limit of compressible current-vortex sheets under certain stability conditions on the free interface; Second, when the two-phase flows are isentropic and the density functions converge to the same constant as Mach number goes to zero, we can drop the boundedness assumption (with respect to Mach number) on high-order time derivatives by combining the paradifferential approach applied to the evolution equation of the free interface, the structure of wave equations for the total pressure and the anisotropic Sobolev spaces with suitable weights of Mach number. To our knowledge, this is the first result that rigorously justifies the incompressible limit for both compressible vortex sheets and free-surface ideal MHD flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a condition under which the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG) model possesses a solution that is holomorphic in time with values in the Gevrey space of complex analytic functions. This can be seen as the complex extension of the work by Levermore and Oliver (1997) for the generalized Euler equation but applied to the TQG model.</description>

      <title>Periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with distributional potential and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue some investigations on the periodic NLSE started by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer and by Bourgain with the addition of a distributional multiplicative potential. We prove that the equation is globally wellposed for a set of data of full normalized Gibbs measure, after suitable truncation in the focusing case. The set and the measure are invariant under the flow. The main ingredients used are Strichartz estimates on periodic NLS with distributional potential to obtain local well-posedness for low regularity initial data.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Sum Differential Game with Exit Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with a zero-sum differential game in the case where a payoff is determined by the exit time, that is, the first time when the system leaves the game domain. Additionally, we assume that a part of domain's boundary is a lifeline where the payoff is infinite. Hereby, the examined problem generalizes the well-known time-optimal problem as well as time-optimal problem with lifeline. The main result of the paper relies on the solution to the Direchlet problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated with the game with exit time. We prove the existence of the value function for examined problem and construct suboptimal feedback strategies under assumption that the associated Dirichlet problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation admits a viscosity/minimax solution. Additionally, we derive a sufficient condition of existence result to this Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <title>Bona-Smith-type systems in bounded domains with slip-wall boundary conditions: Theoretical justification and a conservative numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considered herein is a class of Boussinesq systems of Bona-Smith type that describe water waves in bounded two-dimensional domains with slip-wall boundary conditions and variable bottom topography. Such boundary conditions are necessary in situations involving water waves in channels, ports, and generally in basins with solid boundaries. We prove that, given appropriate initial conditions, the corresponding initial-boundary value problems have unique solutions locally in time, which is a fundamental property of deterministic mathematical modeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the systems under consideration adhere to three basic conservation laws for water waves: mass, vorticity, and energy conservation.
  The theoretical analysis of these specific Boussinesq systems leads to a conservative mixed finite element formulation. Using explicit, relaxation Runge-Kutta methods for the discretization in time, we devise a fully discrete scheme for the numerical solution of initial-boundary value problems with slip-wall conditions, preserving mass, vorticity, and energy. Finally, we present a series of challenging numerical experiments to assess the applicability of the new numerical model.</description>

      <title>Time and frequency domain low order, low frequency approximation of mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control design for linear, time-invariant mechanical systems typically requires an accurate low-order approximation in the low frequency range. For example a series expansion of the transfer function around zero consisting of a mass, velocity, and compliance term. Because computing such a series expansion of the transfer function can be cumbersome, a new method to compute low-order approximations of mechanical systems is developed in this paper. The method does not require an explicit expression for the transfer function, which is not always available for infinite-dimensional systems. The advantages of the proposed method is demonstrated in three examples.</description>

      <title>A phase-field version of the Faber--Krahn theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10946v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a phase-field version of the Faber--Krahn theorem based on a phase-field optimization problem introduced in Garcke et al. [ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var. 29 (2023), Paper No. 10] formulated for the principal eigenvalue of the Dirichlet--Laplacian. The shape, that is to be optimized, is represented by a phase-field function mapping into the interval $[0,1]$. We show that any minimizer of our problem is a radially symmetric-decreasing phase-field attaining values close to $0$ and $1$ except for a thin transition layer whose thickness is of order $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Our proof relies on radially symmetric-decreasing rearrangements and corresponding functional inequalities. Moreover, we provide a $\Gamma$-convergence result which allows us to recover a variant of the Faber--Krahn theorem for sets of finite perimeter in the sharp interface limit.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles for solutions to the Cauchy problem for a dispersive-dissipative equation with a cubic nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for a dispersive-dissipative equation with a cubic nonlinearity. It is known that the leading term of the asymptotic profile for the solution to this problem is the Gaussian. Moreover, by analyzing the corresponding integral equation, the higher-order asymptotic expansion for the solution to the linear part and the first asymptotic profile for the Duhamel term have already been obtained. In this paper, we construct the second asymptotic profile for the Duhamel term and give the more detailed higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solutions, which generalizes the previous works. Furthermore, we emphasize that the new obtained higher-order asymptotic profiles have a good structure in the sense of satisfying the parabolic self-similarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we devise a deep learning algorithm to find non-trivial zeros of Fokker-Planck operators when the drift is non-solenoidal. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm for problem dimensions ranging from 2 to 10. This method scales linearly with dimension in memory usage. In the problems we studied, overall computational time seems to scale approximately quadratically with dimension. We present results that indicate the potential of this method to produce better approximations compared to Monte Carlo methods, for the same overall sample sizes, even in low dimensions. Unlike the Monte Carlo methods, the deep network method gives a functional form of the solution. We also demonstrate that the associated loss function is strongly correlated with the distance from the true solution, thus providing a strong numerical justification for the algorithm. Moreover, this relation seems to be linear asymptotically for small values of the loss function.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the Carleman estimates to high dimensional parabolic equations with highly degenerate symmetric coefficients on a bounded domain of Lipschitz boundary and use these estimates to study the controlla?bility the corresponding equations. Due to the nonsmoothness and degeneracy of boundary, the partial integration by parts in Carleman estimates have no meaning on the degenerate and nonsmooth parts of the boundary. To get around of this difficulty, we construct special weight function, and transform some integral terms in degenerate regions into a non-degenerate ones carefully so that the obtained Carleman estimates can still be used to the controllability problem. Our results includes some well-known works as some special cases as well as some interesting new examples.</description>

      <title>Solving Fokker-Planck equations using the zeros of Fokker-Planck operators and the Feynman-Kac formula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First we show that physics-informed neural networks are not suitable for a large class of parabolic partial differential equations including the Fokker-Planck equation. Then we devise an algorithm to compute solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation using the zeros of Fokker-Planck operator and the Feynman-Kac formula. The resulting algorithm is mesh-free, highly parallelizable and able to compute solutions pointwise, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality in a practical sense. We analyze various nuances of this algorithm that are determined by the drift term in the Fokker-Planck equation. We work with problems ranging in dimensions from 2 to 10. We demonstrate that this algorithm requires orders of magnitude fewer trajectories for each point in space when compared to Monte-Carlo. We also prove that under suitable conditions the error that is caused by letting some trajectories (associated with the Feynman-Kac expectation) escape our domain of knowledge is proportional to the fraction of trajectories that escape.</description>

Abstract: We present a nonvariational setting for the Neumann problem for harmonic functions that are H\"{o}lder continuous and that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Then we introduce a space of distributions on the boundary (a space of first order traces for H\"{o}lder continuous harmonic functions), we analyze the properties of the corresponding distributional single layer potential and we prove a representation theorem for harmonic H\"{o}lder continuous functions in terms of distributional single layer potentials. As an application, we solve the interior and exterior Neumann problem with distributional data in the space of first order traces that has been introduced.</description>

      <title>New estimates for a class of non-local approximations of the total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-local functionals recently introduced by H. Brezis, A. Seeger, J. Van Schaftingen, and P.-L. Yung, which offers a novel way to characterize functions with bounded variation.
  We give a positive answer to an open question related to these functionals in the case of functions with bounded variation. Specifically, we prove that in this case the liminf of these functionals can be estimated from below by a linear combination in which the three terms that sum up to the total variation (namely the total variation of the absolutely continuous part, of the jump part and of the Cantor part) appear with different coefficients. We prove also that this estimate is optimal in the case where the Cantor part vanishes, and we compute the precise value of the limit in this specific scenario.
  In the proof we start by showing the results in dimension one by relying on some measure theoretic arguments in order to identify sufficiently many disjoint rectangles in which the difference quotient can be estimated, and then we extend them to higher dimension by a classical sectioning argument.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>
