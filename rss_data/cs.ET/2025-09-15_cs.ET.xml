      <title>Framework for Formal Modelling of Metaverse Applications Using Hierarchical Colored Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Metaverse emerges by integrating highly-distributed, complex, and interconnecting technologies. These technologies need to be formally verified and evaluated through formal modelling before executing them in real-world applications, in order to avoid negative impacts on the real world due to failure of the Metaverse technologies. However, the formal modelling of Metaverse technologies is challenging due to its highly complex nature. Therefore, a comprehensive formal verification of the Metaverse technologies is needed for its realization in multiple potential areas. In this study, a framework is proposed for the formal modelling of Metaverse technologies, which allows holistic insights for all applications of Metaverse technologies. By utilizing the proposed framework, Metaverse applications of any complexity can be modeled. The working of the proposed framework is illustrated by modelling a case study of an Air Traffic Control system. In the proposed framework, we utilize hierarchical colored Petri nets for formal modelling of behavior of the air traffic control system. The correctness of air traffic control system properties, such as liveness, reachability, and boundedness, is verified in the proposed framework. The results of the case study reveal that the proposed framework can be used as a template for mathematical verification of challenging and complex Metaverse applications. The results also show that formal modelling provides an effective tool for identifying flaws in the early phases of the design of Metaverse applications. The implication of using formal verification is that it can increase confidence about the correctness of the Metaverse applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks for Efficient Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.</description>

      <title>Vital Signs Monitoring with mmWave OFDM JCAS System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless techniques for monitoring human vital signs, such as heart and breathing rates, offer a promising solution in the context of joint communication and sensing (JCAS) with applications in medicine, sports, safety, security, and even the military. This paper reports experimental results obtained at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Ilmenau, demonstrating the effectiveness of an indoor orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) JCAS system for detecting human heart and breathing rates. The system operated in a bistatic configuration at an FR2 frequency of 26.5 GHz with a variable bandwidth of up to 1 GHz. Measurements were taken under various scenarios, including a subject lying down, sitting, or walking, in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions, and with one or two subjects present simultaneously. The results indicate that while vital sign detection is generally feasible, its effectiveness is influenced by several factors, such as the subjects clothing, activity, as well as the distance and angle relative to the sensing system. In addition, no significant influence of bandwidth was detected since the vital signs information is encoded in the phase of the signal.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ride-Sourcing Markets: Can Minimum Wage Regulation Protect Drivers Without Disrupting the Market?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride-sourcing platforms such as Uber and Lyft are prime examples of the gig economy, recruiting drivers as independent contractors, thereby avoiding legal and fiscal obligations. Although platforms offer flexibility in choosing work shifts and areas, many drivers experience low income and poor working conditions, leading to widespread strikes and protests. Minimum wage regulation is adopted to improve drivers welfare. However, the impacts of this regulation on drivers as well as on travelers and platforms, remain largely unknown. While ride-sourcing platforms do not disclose the relevant data, state-of-the-art models fail to explain the effects of minimum wage regulation on market dynamics. In this study, we assess the effectiveness and implications of minimum wage regulation in ride-sourcing markets while simulating the detailed dynamics of ride-sourcing markets under varying regulation intensities, both with and without the so-called platform lockout strategy. Our findings reveal that minimum wage regulation impacts substantially drivers income, and may lead to higher fares for travelers and threaten platforms survival. When platforms adopt a lockout strategy, their profitability significantly improves and drivers earn more, although many others lose their jobs, and service level for travelers consequently declines.</description>

      <title>HiPARS: Highly-Parallel Atom Rearrangement Sequencer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computing's great scaling potential has resulted in it emerging as a popular modality in recent years. For state preparation, atoms are loaded stochastically and have to be detected and rearranged at runtime to create a predetermined initial configuration for circuit execution. Such rearrangement schemes either suffer from low parallelizability for acousto-optic deflector (AOD)-based approaches or are comparatively slow in case of spatial light modulators (SLMs). In our work, we introduce an algorithm that can improve the parallelizability of the former. Since the transfer of atoms from static SLM traps to AOD-generated movable traps is detrimental both in terms of atom loss rates and execution time, our approach is based on highly-parallel composite moves where many atoms are picked up simultaneously and maneuvered into target positions that may be comparatively distant. We see that our algorithm outperforms its alternatives for near-term devices with up to around 1000 qubits and has the potential to scale up to several thousand with further optimizations.</description>

      <title>ReCross: Efficient Embedding Reduction Scheme for In-Memory Computing using ReRAM-Based Crossbar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based recommendation models (DLRMs) are widely deployed in commercial applications to enhance user experience. However, the large and sparse embedding layers in these models impose substantial memory bandwidth bottlenecks due to high memory access costs and irregular access patterns, leading to increased inference time and energy consumption. While resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based crossbars offer a fast and energy-efficient solution through in-memory embedding reduction operations, naively mapping embeddings onto crossbar arrays leads to poor crossbar utilization and thus degrades performance. We present ReCross, an efficient ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) scheme designed to minimize execution time and enhance energy efficiency in DLRM embedding reduction. ReCross co-optimizes embedding access patterns and ReRAM crossbar characteristics by intelligently grouping and mapping co-occurring embeddings, replicating frequently accessed embeddings across crossbars, and dynamically selecting in-memory processing operations using a newly designed dynamic switch ADC circuit that considers runtime energy trade-offs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCross achieves a 3.97x reduction in execution time and a 6.1x improvement in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art IMC approaches.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding for UX Design: Understanding UX Professionals' Perceptions of AI-Assisted Design and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping UX design practices through "vibe coding," where UX professionals express intent in natural language and AI translates it into functional prototypes and code. Despite rapid adoption, little research has examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.</description>

      <title>LLM in the Middle: A Systematic Review of Threats and Mitigations to Real-World LLM-based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success and wide adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has attracted the attention of cybercriminals seeking to abuse models, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services. Moreover, providing security to LLM-based systems is a great challenge, as both traditional threats to software applications and threats targeting LLMs and their integration must be mitigated. In this survey, we shed light on security and privacy concerns of such LLM-based systems by performing a systematic review and comprehensive categorization of threats and defensive strategies considering the entire software and LLM life cycles. We analyze real-world scenarios with distinct characteristics of LLM usage, spanning from development to operation. In addition, threats are classified according to their severity level and to which scenarios they pertain, facilitating the identification of the most relevant threats. Recommended defense strategies are systematically categorized and mapped to the corresponding life cycle phase and possible attack strategies they attenuate. This work paves the way for consumers and vendors to understand and efficiently mitigate risks during integration of LLMs in their respective solutions or organizations. It also enables the research community to benefit from the discussion of open challenges and edge cases that may hinder the secure and privacy-preserving adoption of LLM-based systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Sensing Aided mmWave Beamforming for V2V Communications with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32 dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.</description>

      <title>An Incentive-Compatible Reward Sharing Mechanism for Mitigating Mirroring Attacks in Decentralized Data-Feed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized data-feed systems enable blockchain-based smart contracts to access off-chain information by aggregating values from multiple oracles. To improve accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as majority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a decision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the oracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards. However, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a single user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation function and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring attacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed systems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally encourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose a new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the proposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only one oracle. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed incentive mechanism and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an oscillator model with both phase and amplitude dynamics for oscillator-based Ising machines (OIMs). The model targets combinatorial optimization problems with polynomial cost functions of arbitrary order and addresses fundamental limitations of previous OIM models through a mathematically rigorous formulation with a well-defined energy function and corresponding dynamics. The model demonstrates monotonic energy decrease and reliable convergence to low-energy states. Empirical evaluations on 3-SAT problems show significant performance improvements over existing phase-amplitude models. Additionally, we propose a flexible, generalizable framework for designing higher-order oscillator interactions, from which we derive a practical method for oscillator binarization without compromising performance. This work strengthens both the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of oscillator-based Ising machines for complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Toward a Sustainable Low-Altitude Economy: A Survey of Energy-Efficient RIS-UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of RIS into UAV networks presents a transformative solution for achieving energy-efficient and reliable communication, particularly within the rapidly expanding low-altitude economy (LAE). As UAVs facilitate diverse aerial services-spanning logistics to smart surveillance-their limited energy reserves create significant challenges. RIS effectively addresses this issue by dynamically shaping the wireless environment to enhance signal quality, reduce power consumption, and extend UAV operation time, thus enabling sustainable and scalable deployment across various LAE applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RIS-assisted UAV networks, focusing on energy-efficient design within LAE applications. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of RIS, covering its operational modes, deployment architectures, and roles in both terrestrial and aerial environments. Next, advanced EE-driven strategies for integrating RIS and UAVs. Techniques such as trajectory optimization, power control, beamforming, and dynamic resource management are examined. Emphasis is placed on collaborative solutions that incorporate UAV-mounted RIS, wireless energy harvesting (EH), and intelligent scheduling frameworks. We further categorize RIS-enabled schemes based on key performance objectives relevant to LAE scenarios. These objectives include sum rate maximization, coverage extension, QoS guarantees, secrecy rate improvement, latency reduction, and age of information (AoI) minimization. The survey also delves into RIS-UAV synergy with emerging technologies like MEC, NOMA, V2X communication, and WPT. These technologies are crucial to the LAE ecosystem. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, emphasizing the critical role of energy-aware, RIS-enhanced UAV networks in shaping scalable, sustainable, and intelligent infrastructures within the LAE.</description>

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a quantitative framework for analyzing information transfer within biological systems. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive MC framework for the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a system of six coupled, nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs). The proposed model defines a bidirectional feedback loop with a gut-to-brain inflammatory channel and a brain-to-gut neuroendocrine channel. Under prolonged stress, this feedback loop becomes self-perpetuating and drives the system into a pathological state. We evaluate the end-to-end channel across varying conditions using time-domain simulations, small-signal frequency-domain characterization, and an information-theoretic capacity analysis. At homeostasis, the system maintains stable circadian dynamics with higher information throughput, whereas sustained stress drives a shift to dysregulated hypercortisolism. In this pathological state, spectral efficiency decreases due to a narrowed effective bandwidth and a lower passband gain driven by neuroendocrine delays and saturating cytokine-hormone kinetics. These results quantify the impact of these signaling mechanisms on stability and information processing, elucidating the transition from healthy circadian rhythms to a persistent pathological state of hypercortisolism.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Array-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) technology has been proposed to enhance the performance of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. However, within 6DMA-related research, studies on the ISAC system based on rotatable array (RA) remains relatively limited. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on a channel model that accounts for the efficiency of the antenna radiation pattern and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user RA-aided ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) method, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) framework, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. For the analog beamforming optimization subproblem, we adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to transform the objective function, thereby deriving the closed-form update expression for the analog beamforming matrix. For the antenna rotation optimization subproblem, we derive the closed-form derivative expression of the array rotation angle and propose a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RA-aided hybrid beamforming design method. It not only significantly improves the overall system performance while reducing hardware costs, but also achieves performance comparable to that of the fully-digital beamforming design with fixed-position antennas (FPA) under specific parameter configurations.</description>

      <title>Fast and low energy approximate full adder based on FELIX logic</title>

Abstract: In the "Big Data" era, a lot of data must be processed and moved between processing and memory units. New technologies and architectures have emerged to improve system performance and overcome the memory bottleneck. The memristor is a technology with both computing and memory capabilities. In-Memory Computing (IMC) can be performed by applying memristors to stateful design methods. The Fast and Energy-Efficient Logic in Memory (FELIX) logic is one of the stateful implementation logics compatible with memristive crossbar arrays. The way computations are performed can be changed to improve performance. Approximate design methods can be applied in error-resilient applications. In error-resilient applications, an acceptable amount of precision is lost while features such as hardware complexity, latency, and energy are improved. In this paper, using these two concepts, an approximate full adder circuit with exact Cout and approximate Sum outputs has been proposed using the FELIX design method for IMC in two different implementation approaches. The applied memristor count in the proposed FELIX-based Approximate Full Adder (FAFA) in the two proposed implementation approaches (FAFA1 and FAFA2) is improved by 14.28% and 28.57%, energy consumption is improved by 73.735% and 81.754%, respectively. The number of computational steps in both approaches is improved by 66.66% compared to the exact FELIX-based full adder. In this paper, two different scenarios are considered for evaluating the FAFA. In the 1st and 2nd scenarios, respectively, for the three and four Most Significant Bits (MSBs), the exact full adder is used, and for the five and four Least Significant Bits (LSBs), the FAFA is used. The results of error analysis and evaluations of the FAFA in three different image processing applications confirmed that FAFA has high accuracy and acceptable performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous In-situ Soil Sampling and Mapping in Large-Scale Agricultural Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05653</link>

Abstract: Traditional soil sampling and analysis methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and limited in spatial resolution, making them unsuitable for large-scale precision agriculture. To address these limitations, we present a robotic solution for real-time sampling, analysis and mapping of key soil properties. Our system consists of two main sub-systems: a Sample Acquisition System (SAS) for precise, automated in-field soil sampling; and a Sample Analysis Lab (Lab) for real-time soil property analysis. The system's performance was validated through extensive field trials at a large-scale Australian farm. Experimental results show that the SAS can consistently acquire soil samples with a mass of 50g at a depth of 200mm, while the Lab can process each sample within 10 minutes to accurately measure pH and macronutrients. These results demonstrate the potential of the system to provide farmers with timely, data-driven insights for more efficient and sustainable soil management and fertilizer application.</description>

      <title>Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Neuromorphic Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</description>
