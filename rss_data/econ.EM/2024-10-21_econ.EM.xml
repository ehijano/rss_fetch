      <title>Identification of a Rank-dependent Peer Effect Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an econometric model to analyse heterogeneity in peer effects in network data with endogenous spillover across units. We introduce a rank-dependent peer effect model that captures how the relative ranking of a peer outcome shapes the influence units have on one another, by modeling the peer effect to be linear in ordered peer outcomes. In contrast to the traditional linear-in-means model, our approach allows for greater flexibility in peer effect by accounting for the distribution of peer outcomes as well as the size of peer groups. Under a minimal condition, the rank-dependent peer effect model admits a unique equilibrium and is therefore tractable. Our simulations show that that estimation performs well in finite samples given sufficient covariate strength. We then apply our model to educational data from Norway, where we see that higher-performing students disproportionately drive GPA spillovers.</description>

      <title>GARCH option valuation with long-run and short-run volatility components: A novel framework ensuring positive variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Christoffersen, Jacobs, Ornthanalai, and Wang (2008) (CJOW) proposed an improved Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model for valuing European options, where the return volatility is comprised of two distinct components. Empirical studies indicate that the model developed by CJOW outperforms widely-used single-component GARCH models and provides a superior fit to options data than models that combine conditional heteroskedasticity with Poisson-normal jumps. However, a significant limitation of this model is that it allows the variance process to become negative. Oh and Park [2023] partially addressed this issue by developing a related model, yet the positivity of the volatility components is not guaranteed, both theoretically and empirically. In this paper we introduce a new GARCH model that improves upon the models by CJOW and Oh and Park [2023], ensuring the positivity of the return volatility. In comparison to the two earlier GARCH approaches, our novel methodology shows comparable in-sample performance on returns data and superior performance on S&amp;P500 options data.</description>

      <title>A GARCH model with two volatility components and two driving factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel GARCH model that integrates two sources of uncertainty to better capture the rich, multi-component dynamics often observed in the volatility of financial assets. This model provides a quasi closed-form representation of the characteristic function for future log-returns, from which semi-analytical formulas for option pricing can be derived. A theoretical analysis is conducted to establish sufficient conditions for strict stationarity and geometric ergodicity, while also obtaining the continuous-time diffusion limit of the model. Empirical evaluations, conducted both in-sample and out-of-sample using S\&amp;P500 time series data, show that our model outperforms widely used single-factor models in predicting returns and option prices.</description>

      <title>Inference for Low-rank Models without Estimating the Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the inference about linear functionals of high-dimensional low-rank matrices. While most existing inference methods would require consistent estimation of the true rank, our procedure is robust to rank misspecification, making it a promising approach in applications where rank estimation can be unreliable. We estimate the low-rank spaces using pre-specified weighting matrices, known as diversified projections. A novel statistical insight is that, unlike the usual statistical wisdom that overfitting mainly introduces additional variances, the over-estimated low-rank space also gives rise to a non-negligible bias due to an implicit ridge-type regularization. We develop a new inference procedure and show that the central limit theorem holds as long as the pre-specified rank is no smaller than the true rank. In one of our applications, we study multiple testing with incomplete data in the presence of confounding factors and show that our method remains valid as long as the number of controlled confounding factors is at least as large as the true number, even when no confounding factors are present.</description>

      <title>Identifying Causal Effects of Discrete, Ordered and ContinuousTreatments using Multiple Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observational data is often challenging due to endogeneity. This paper provides new identification results for causal effects of discrete, ordered and continuous treatments using multiple binary instruments. The key contribution is the identification of a new causal parameter that has a straightforward interpretation with a positive weighting scheme and is applicable in many settings due to a mild monotonicity assumption. This paper further leverages recent advances in causal machine learning for both estimation and the detection of local violations of the underlying monotonicity assumption. The methodology is applied to estimate the returns to education and assess the impact of having an additional child on female labor market outcomes.</description>

      <title>Experimenting on Markov Decision Processes with Local Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing randomized experiments to evaluate the effect of short-term treatments on the short-term outcomes has been well understood and become the golden standard in industrial practice. However, as service systems become increasingly dynamical and personalized, much focus is shifting toward maximizing long-term cumulative outcomes, such as customer lifetime value, through lifetime exposure to interventions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the randomized experiments within dynamical systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our goal is to assess the impact of treatment and control policies on long-term cumulative rewards from relatively short-term observations. We first develop optimal inference techniques for assessing the effects of general treatment patterns. Furthermore, recognizing that many real-world treatments tend to be fine-grained and localized for practical efficiency and operational convenience, we then propose methods to harness this localized structure by sharing information on the non-targeted states. Our new estimator effectively overcomes the variance lower bound for general treatments while matching the more stringent lower bound incorporating the local treatment structure. Furthermore, our estimator can optimally achieve a linear reduction with the number of test arms for a major part of the variance. Finally, we explore scenarios with perfect knowledge of the control arm and design estimators that further improve inference efficiency.</description>
