      <title>Transaction Profiling and Address Role Inference in Tokenized U.S. Treasuries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as a prominent subclass of real-world assets (RWAs), offering cryptographically enforced, yield-bearing instruments collateralized by sovereign debt and deployed across multiple blockchain networks. While the market has expanded rapidly, empirical analyses of transaction-level behaviour remain limited. This paper conducts a quantitative, function-level dissection of U.S. Treasury-backed RWA tokens including BUIDL, BENJI, and USDY, across multi-chain: mostly Ethereum and Layer-2s. We analyze decoded contract calls to isolate core functional primitives such as issuance, redemption, transfer, and bridge activity, revealing segmentation in behaviour between institutional actors and retail users. To model address-level economic roles, we introduce a curvature-aware representation learning framework using Poincar\'e embeddings and liquidity-based graph features. Our method outperforms baseline models on our RWA Treasury dataset in role inference and generalizes to downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and wallet classification in broader blockchain transaction networks. These findings provide a structured understanding of functional heterogeneity and participant roles in tokenized Treasury in a transaction-level perspective, contributing new empirical evidence to the study of on-chain financialization.</description>

      <title>NUFFT for the Fast COS Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COS method is a very efficient way to compute European option prices under L\'evy models or affine stochastic volatility models, based on a Fourier Cosine expansion of the density, involving the characteristic function. This note shows how to compute the COS method formula with a non-uniform fast Fourier transform, thus allowing to price many options of the same maturity but different strikes at an unprecedented speed.</description>

      <title>On an Optimal Stopping Problem with a Discontinuous Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal stopping problem with an unbounded, time-dependent and discontinuous reward function. This problem is motivated by the pricing of a variable annuity contract with guaranteed minimum maturity benefit, under the assumption that the policyholder's surrender behaviour maximizes the risk-neutral value of the contract. We consider a general fee and surrender charge function, and give a condition under which optimal stopping always occurs at maturity. Using an alternative representation for the value function of the optimization problem, we study its analytical properties and the resulting surrender (or exercise) region. In particular, we show that the non-emptiness and the shape of the surrender region are fully characterized by the fee and the surrender charge functions, which provides a powerful tool to understand their interrelation and how it affects early surrenders and the optimal surrender boundary. Under certain conditions on these two functions, we develop three representations for the value function; two are analogous to their American option counterpart, and one is new to the actuarial and American option pricing literature.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity/FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities/cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Dimensional Barrier: A Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization for Continuous-Time Multi-Asset Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11116v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale, continuous-time portfolio optimization problems involving numerous assets and state-dependent dynamics has long been challenged by the curse of dimensionality. Traditional dynamic programming and PDE-based methods, while rigorous, typically become computationally intractable beyond a few state variables (~3-6 limit in prior studies). To overcome this critical barrier, we introduce the Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework. Our framework accurately captures both myopic demand and complex intertemporal hedging demands, a feat often elusive for other methods in high-dimensional settings. P-PGDPO delivers near-optimal policies, offering a practical and powerful alternative for a broad class of high-dimensional continuous-time control problems. PG-DPO leverages Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) to directly inform neural network-based policy learning. A key contribution is our highly efficient Projected PG-DPO (P-PGDPO) variant. This approach uniquely utilizes BPTT to obtain rapidly stabilizing estimates of the Pontryagin costates and their crucial derivatives with respect to the state variables. These estimates are then analytically projected onto the manifold of optimal controls dictated by PMP's first-order conditions, significantly reducing training overhead and enhancing accuracy. This enables a breakthrough in scalability: numerical experiments demonstrate that P-PGDPO successfully tackles problems with dimensions previously considered far out of reach (up to 50 assets and 10 state variables).</description>
