      <title>Quadratic obstructions to Small-Time Local Controllability for the multi-input bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the small-time local controllability (STLC) near the ground state of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation when the linearized system is not controllable. It is well known that, for single-input systems, quadratic terms in the state expansion can then lead to obstructions to the STLC of the nonlinear system. In this work, we extend this phenomenon to the multi-input setting, presenting the first example of multi-input quadratic obstructions for PDEs. Our results build upon our previous study of such obstructions for ODEs and provide a functional framework for analyzing them in the bilinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Inferring System and Optimal Control Parameters of Closed-Loop Systems from Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the joint problem of system identification and inverse optimal control for discrete-time stochastic Linear Quadratic Regulators. We analyze finite and infinite time horizons in a partially observed setting, where the state is observed noisily. To recover closed-loop system parameters, we develop inference methods based on probabilistic state-space model (SSM) techniques. First, we show that the system parameters exhibit non-identifiability in the infinite-horizon from closed-loop measurements, and we provide exact and numerical methods to disentangle the parameters. Second, to improve parameter identifiability, we show that we can further enhance recovery by either (1) incorporating additional partial measurements of the control signals or (2) moving to the finite-horizon setting. We further illustrate the performance of our methodology through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A control-oriented approach to optimal sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a control-oriented optimal experimental design (cOED) approach for linear PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems. In particular, we consider optimal control problems with uncertain parameters that need to be estimated by solving an inverse problem, which in turn requires measurement data. We consider the case where data is collected at a set of sensors. While classical Bayesian OED techniques provide experimental designs (sensor placements) that minimize the posterior uncertainty in the inversion parameter, these designs are not tailored to the demands of the optimal control problem. In the present control-oriented setting, we prioritize the designs that minimize the uncertainty in the state variable being controlled or the control objective. We propose a mathematical framework for uncertainty quantification and cOED for parameterized PDE-constrained optimal control problems with linear dependence to the control variable and the inversion parameter. We also present scalable computational methods for computing control-oriented sensor placements and for quantifying the uncertainty in the control objective. Additionally, we present illustrative numerical results in the context of a model problem motivated by heat transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Comfortable Consumption under Epstein-Zin utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to solving the optimal portfolio choice problem under Epstein-Zin utility with a time-varying consumption constraint, where analytical expressions for the value function and the dual value function are not obtainable. We first establish several key properties of the value function, with a particular focus on the $C^2$ smoothness property. We then characterize the value function and prove the verification theorem by using the linearization method to the highly nonlinear HJB equation, despite the candidate value function being unknown a priori. Additionally, we present the sufficient and necessary conditions for the value function and explicitly characterize the constrained region. Our approach is versatile and can be applied to other portfolio choice problems with constraints where explicit solutions for both the primal and dual problems are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Constructing QCQP Instances Equivalent to Their SDP Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are challenging to solve as they are known to be NP-hard. A popular approach to approximating QCQP solutions is to use semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. It is well-known that the optimal value $\eta$ of the SDP relaxation problem bounds the optimal value $\zeta$ of the QCQP from below, i.e., $\eta \leq \zeta$. The two problems are considered equivalent if $\eta = \zeta$. In the recent paper by Arima, Kim and Kojima [arXiv:2409.07213], a class of QCQPs that are equivalent to their SDP relaxations are proposed with no condition imposed on the quadratic objective function, which can be chosen arbitrarily. In this work, we explore the construction of various QCQP instances within this class to complement the results in [arXiv:2409.07213]. Specifically, we first construct QCQP instances with two variables and then extend them to higher dimensions. We also discuss how to compute an optimal QCQP solution from the SDP relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-based local search approach for finding feasible solutions of large-scale maritime inventory routing optimization problems. Given the combinatorial complexity of the problems, we integrate a graph neural network-based neighborhood selection method to enhance local search efficiency. Our approach enables a structured exploration of vessel neighborhoods, improving solution quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Through extensive computational experiments on realistic instances, we demonstrate that our method outperforms direct mixed-integer programming in solution time.</description>

      <title>Bushfires and Balance: Proactive versus Reactive Policies in Prescribed Burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model to describe the interplay between prescribed burning and bushfires based on a system of ordinary differential equations.
  We show that the system possesses a unique steady-state, whose stability depends on the policy governing prescribed burning. Specifically, a Reactive Policy in which prescribed burning activities are increased in response to bushfire events risks to produce instability and requires an additional feedback control, while a Proactive Policy in which moderate prescribed burning replaces natural bushfires may be more effective to maintain a balanced state. A high regeneration factor is also helpful to ensuring the stability of the equilibrium state.
  The results presented here should not be regarded as a definitive solution to the issue of prescribed burning, as numerous specific factors must be considered in any comprehensive policymaking approach. Nonetheless, the stability analysis developed in this paper suggests that policies driven primarily by reactive responses to bushfire events may be emotionally charged and prone to instability. These reactive policies would benefit from incorporating feedback control mechanisms. In contrast, strategies based on proactive prescribed burning in moderate quantities, focused on prevention rather than reaction, are likely to be more effective in maintaining long-term ecological stability.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Real-Time Optimal Power Flow Algorithm Using Local Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) adds variability as well as fast control capabilities to power networks. Dispatching the DERs based on local information to provide real-time optimal network operation is the desideratum. In this paper, we propose a data-driven real-time algorithm that uses only the local measurements to solve time-varying AC optimal power flow (OPF). Specifically, we design a learnable function that takes the local feedback as input in the algorithm. The learnable function, under certain conditions, will result in a unique stationary point of the algorithm, which in turn transfers the OPF problems to be optimized over the parameters of the function. We then develop a stochastic primal-dual update to solve the variant of the OPF problems based on a deep neural network (DNN) parametrization of the learnable function, which is referred to as the training stage. We also design a gradient-free alternative to bypass the cumbersome gradient calculation of the nonlinear power flow model. The OPF solution-tracking error bound is established in the sense of universal approximation of DNN. Numerical results on the IEEE 37-bus test feeder show that the proposed method can track the time-varying OPF solutions with higher accuracy and faster computation compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Spatially Controlled Evolution of Composite Materials via Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of controlled stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) arising in the modeling of composite materials with spatially varying properties. The state equation describes the evolution of a material property, influenced by control inputs that adjust the diffusivity in different spatial regions. We establish the existence of mild solutions to the SPDE under appropriate regularity conditions on the coefficients and the control. A derivation of the sufficient and necessary conditions for optimality is provided using the stochastic maximum principle. These conditions connect the state dynamics to adjoint processes, enabling the characterization of the optimal control in terms of the curvature of the state and the sensitivity of the cost. Two explicit solvable examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results, where the optimal control is computed explicitly for a composite material with piecewise constant diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Error of Value Functions in Sobolev Norm Yields Bounds on Suboptimality of Controller Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal feedback controllers for nonlinear systems can be derived by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, because the HJB is a nonlinear partial differential equation, in general only approximate solutions can be numerically found. While numerical error bounds on approximate HJB solutions are often available, we show that these bounds do not necessarily translate into guarantees on the suboptimality of the resulting controllers. In this paper, we establish that if the numerical error in the HJB solution can be bounded in a Sobolev norm, a norm involving spatial derivatives, then the suboptimality of the corresponding feedback controller can also be bounded, and this bound can be made arbitrarily small. In contrast, we demonstrate that such guarantees do not hold when the error is measured in more typical norms, such as the uniform norm ($L^\infty$). Our results apply to systems governed by locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics over a finite time horizon with a compact input space. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Gossip Algorithms for Approximate Quantile and Mean Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first gossip algorithms that are robust to adversarial corruptions. Gossip algorithms distribute information in a scalable and efficient way by having random pairs of nodes exchange small messages. Value aggregation problems are of particular interest in this setting as they occur frequently in practice and many elegant algorithms have been proposed for computing aggregates and statistics such as averages and quantiles. An important and well-studied advantage of gossip algorithms is their robustness to message delays, network churn, and unreliable message transmissions. These crucial robustness guarantees however only hold if all nodes follow the protocol and no messages are corrupted. In this paper, we remedy this by providing a framework to model both adversarial participants and message corruptions in gossip-style communications by allowing an adversary to control a small fraction of the nodes or corrupt messages arbitrarily. Despite this very powerful and general corruption model, we show that one can design robust gossip algorithms for many important aggregation problems. Our algorithms guarantee that almost all nodes converge to an approximately correct answer with optimal efficiency and essentially as fast as without corruptions. The design of adversarially-robust gossip algorithms poses completely new challenges. Despite this, our algorithms remain very simple variations of known non-robust algorithms with often only subtle changes to avoid non-compliant nodes gaining too much influence over outcomes. While our algorithms remain simple, their analysis is much more complex and often requires a completely different approach than the non-adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Solving quadratic binary optimization problems using quantum SDP methods: Non-asymptotic running time analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can solve semidefinite programs (SDPs) using resources that scale better than state-of-the-art classical methods as a function of the problem dimension. At the same time, the known quantum algorithms scale very unfavorably in the precision, which makes it non-trivial to find applications for which the quantum methods are well-suited. Arguably, precision is less crucial for SDP relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems (such as the Goemans-Williamson algorithm), because these include a final rounding step that maps SDP solutions to binary variables. With this in mind, Brand\~ao, Fran\c{c}a, and Kueng have proposed to use quantum SDP solvers in order to achieve an end-to-end speed-up for obtaining approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. They did indeed succeed in identifying an algorithm that realizes a polynomial quantum advantage in terms of its asymptotic running time. However, asymptotic results say little about the problem sizes for which advantages manifest. Here, we present an analysis of the non-asymptotic resource requirements of this algorithm. The work consists of two parts. First, we optimize the original algorithm with a particular emphasis on performance for realistic problem instances. In particular, we formulate a version with adaptive step-sizes, an improved detection criterion for infeasible instances, and a more efficient rounding procedure. In a second step, we benchmark both the classical and the quantum version of the algorithm. The benchmarks did not identify a regime where even the optimized quantum algorithm would beat standard classical approaches for input sizes that can be realistically solved at all. In the absence of further significant improvements, these algorithms therefore fall into a category sometimes called galactic: Unbeaten in their asymptotic scaling behavior, but not practical for realistic problems.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems with Deep Linear Neural Networks: Global Convergence Guarantees for Gradient Descent with Weight Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are commonly used to solve inverse problems, wherein an unknown signal must be estimated from few measurements generated via a known acquisition procedure. In particular, neural networks perform well empirically but have limited theoretical guarantees. In this work, we study an underdetermined linear inverse problem that admits several possible solution mappings. A standard remedy (e.g., in compressed sensing) establishing uniqueness of the solution mapping is to assume knowledge of latent low-dimensional structure in the source signal. We ask the following question: do deep neural networks adapt to this low-dimensional structure when trained by gradient descent with weight decay regularization? We prove that mildly overparameterized deep linear networks trained in this manner converge to an approximate solution that accurately solves the inverse problem while implicitly encoding latent subspace structure. To our knowledge, this is the first result to rigorously show that deep linear networks trained with weight decay automatically adapt to latent subspace structure in the data under practical stepsize and weight initialization schemes. Our work highlights that regularization and overparameterization improve generalization, while overparameterization also accelerates convergence during training.</description>

      <title>Control of the half-heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate null-controllable initial states of the half heat equation controlled from a sub-arc $\omega$ of the unit circle. We also study the projection on positive frequencies of the half-heat equation. For this projected half-heat equation, we obtain necessary as well as sufficient conditions for an initial condition to be null-controllable. These conditions, which are almost sharp, are expressed in term of projections on positive frequencies of functions supported on $\omega$. From these results, and with the help of classical results on sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions, we also treat the (unprojected) half-heat equation. Surprisingly, without using our conditions on null-controllable states, we are able to show that the space of null-controllable functions does not depend on time by using a result of separation of singularities for holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Training Neural ODEs Using Fully Discretized Simultaneous Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) represent continuous-time dynamics with neural networks, offering advancements for modeling and control tasks. However, training Neural ODEs requires solving differential equations at each epoch, leading to high computational costs. This work investigates simultaneous optimization methods as a faster training alternative. In particular, we employ a collocation-based, fully discretized formulation and use IPOPT--a solver for large-scale nonlinear optimization--to simultaneously optimize collocation coefficients and neural network parameters. Using the Van der Pol Oscillator as a case study, we demonstrate faster convergence compared to traditional training methods. Furthermore, we introduce a decomposition framework utilizing Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to effectively coordinate sub-models among data batches. Our results show significant potential for (collocation-based) simultaneous Neural ODE training pipelines.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Formulations for System Identification of Linear Dynamics with Bilinear Observation Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the identification problem for the systems characterized by linear time-invariant dynamics with bilinear observation models. More precisely, we consider a suitable parametric description of the system and formulate the identification problem as the estimation of the parameters defining the mathematical model of the system using the observed input-output data. To this end, we propose two probabilistic frameworks. The first framework employs the Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach, which accurately finds the optimal parameter estimates by maximizing a likelihood function. Subsequently, we develop a tractable first-order method to solve the optimization problem corresponding to the proposed ML approach. Additionally, to further improve tractability and computational efficiency of the estimation of the parameters, we introduce an alternative framework based on the Expectation--Maximization (EM) approach, which estimates the parameters using an appropriately designed cost function. We show that the EM cost function is invex, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form solution for the optimal parameters and also prove the recursive feasibility of the EM procedure. Through extensive numerical experiments, the practical implementation of the proposed approaches is demonstrated, and their estimation efficacy is verified and compared, highlighting the effectiveness of the methods to accurately estimate the system parameters and their potential for real-world applications in scenarios involving bilinear observation structures.</description>

      <title>Perpertual Coupled Simulated Annealing for Continuous Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:1803.01059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global optimization heuristics are popular to optimize hard non-convex problems. Despite their irrefutably large cost-to-solution, in the lack of other working greedy or convex approaches, global optimization algorithms remain the no-brainer choice. Nevertheless, successful use often requires tedious adjustments to initial parameters to avoid premature convergence. The Coupled Simulated Annealing approach proposed a method based on the coupling of multiple optimizers to escape premature convergence, having achieved success in optimizing hyperparameters of many applications of machine learning; however, a careful choice of the generation temperature is still required. In this paper we propose the Perpetual Orbit technique as a solution to control the generation temperature and avoid search stagnation. In principle, this technique can also be applied to other ensemble- and population-based algorithms that have a dispersion variable. The results of our experiments show superior performance when using the proposed technique because it makes the Couple Simulated Annealing totally parameter-free and capable of reaching equal or better solutions in more than 85\% cases across all functions and competitor methods analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a primal-dual interior point method specialized to clustered low-rank semidefinite programs requiring high precision numerics, which arise from certain multivariate polynomial (matrix) programs through sums-of-squares characterizations and sampling. We consider the interplay of sampling and symmetry reduction as well as a greedy method to obtain numerically good bases and sample points. We apply this to the computation of three-point bounds for the kissing number problem, for which we show a significant speedup. This allows for the computation of improved kissing number bounds in dimensions $11$ through $23$. The approach performs well for problems with bad numerical conditioning, which we show through new computations for the binary sphere packing problem.</description>

Abstract: This technical note is concerned with boundary stabilization of multi-dimensional discrete-velocity kinetic models. By exploiting a certain stability structure of the models and adapting an appropriate Lyapunov functional, we derive feasible control laws so that the corresponding solutions decay exponentially in time. The result is illustrated with an application to the two-dimensional coplanar model in a square container. The effectiveness of the derived control laws is confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of structured nonsmooth optimization problems over an embedded submanifold of a Euclidean space, where the first part of the objective is the sum of a difference-of-convex (DC) function and a smooth function, while the remaining part is the square of a weakly convex function over a smooth function. This model problem has many important applications in machine learning and scientific computing, for example, the sparse generalized eigenvalue problem. We propose a manifold proximal-gradient-subgradient algorithm (MPGSA) and show that under mild conditions any accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by it is a critical point of the underlying problem. By assuming the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of an auxiliary function, we further establish the convergence of the full sequence generated by MPGSA under some suitable conditions. When the second component of the DC function involved is the maximum of finite continuously differentiable convex functions, we also propose an enhanced MPGSA with guaranteed subsequential convergence to a lifted B-stationary points of the optimization problem. Finally, some preliminary numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties.

      <title>Stability analysis through folds: An end-loaded elastic with a lever arm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can only be determined after examining their stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track their transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy for the Gromov Wasserstein Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem is a variant of the classical optimal transport problem that allows one to compute meaningful transportation plans between incomparable spaces. At an intuitive level, it seeks plans that minimize the discrepancy between metric evaluations of pairs of points. The GW problem is typically cast as an instance of a non-convex quadratic program that is, unfortunately, intractable to solve. In this paper, we describe tractable semidefinite relaxations of the GW problem based on the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy. We describe how the Putinar-type and the Schm\"udgen-type moment hierarchies can be simplified using marginal constraints, and we prove convergence rates for these hierarchies towards computing global optimal solutions to the GW problem. The proposed SOS hierarchies naturally induce a distance measure analogous to the distortion metrics, and we show that these are genuine distances in that they satisfy the triangle inequality. In particular, the proposed SOS hierarchies provide computationally tractable proxies of the GW distance and the associated distortion distances (over metric measure spaces) that are otherwise intractable to compute.</description>

Abstract: Many online platforms, ranging from online retail stores to social media platforms, employ algorithms to optimize their offered assortment of items (e.g., products and contents). These algorithms often focus exclusively on achieving the platforms' objectives, highlighting items with the highest popularity or revenue. This approach, however, can compromise the equality of opportunities for the rest of the items, in turn leading to less content diversity and increased regulatory scrutiny for the platform. Motivated by this, we introduce and study a fair assortment planning problem that enforces equality of opportunities via pairwise fairness, which requires any two items to be offered similar outcomes. We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP), called (FAIR), that optimizes over the distribution of all feasible assortments. To find a near-optimal solution to (FAIR), we propose a framework based on the Ellipsoid method, which requires a polynomial-time separation oracle to the dual of the LP. We show that finding an optimal separation oracle to the dual problem is an NP-complete problem, and hence we propose a series of approximate separation oracles, which then result in a 1/2-approx. algorithm and an FPTAS for Problem (FAIR). The approximate separation oracles are designed by (i) showing the separation oracle to the dual of the LP is equivalent to solving an infinite series of parameterized knapsack problems, and (ii) leveraging the structure of knapsack problems. Finally, we perform numerical studies on both synthetic data and real-world MovieLens data, showcasing the effectiveness of our algorithms and providing insights into the platform's price of fairness.</description>

      <title>Degree bounds for Putinar's Positivstellensatz on the hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Positivstellens\"atze of Putinar and Schm\"udgen show that any polynomial $f$ positive on a compact semialgebraic set can be represented using sums of squares. Recently, there has been large interest in proving effective versions of these results, namely to show bounds on the required degree of the sums of squares in such representations. These effective Positivstellens\"atze have direct implications for the convergence rate of the celebrated moment-SOS hierarchy in polynomial optimization. In this paper, we restrict to the fundamental case of the hypercube $\mathrm{B}^{n} = [-1, 1]^n$. We show an upper degree bound for Putinar-type representations on $\mathrm{B}^{n}$ of the order $O(f_{\max}/f_{\min})$, where $f_{\max}$, $f_{\min}$ are the maximum and minimum of $f$ on $\mathrm{B}^{n}$, respectively. Previously, specialized results of this kind were available only for Schm\"udgen-type representations and not for Putinar-type ones. Complementing this upper degree bound, we show a lower degree bound in $\Omega(\sqrt[8]{f_{\max}/f_{\min}})$. This is the first lower bound for Putinar-type representations on a semialgebraic set with nonempty interior described by a standard set of inequalities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, building on the formulation of quantum Markov decision processes (q-MDPs) presented in our previous work [{\sc N.~Saldi, S.~Sanjari, and S.~Y\"{u}ksel}, {\em Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies}, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2024], our focus shifts to the development of semi-definite programming approaches for optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</description>

      <title>Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Deep Neural Networks via Gradient-Free Cutting Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning methods aim to improve sample complexity in machine learning. In this work, we investigate an active learning scheme via a novel gradient-free cutting-plane training method for ReLU networks of arbitrary depth and develop a convergence theory. We demonstrate, for the first time, that cutting-plane algorithms, traditionally used in linear models, can be extended to deep neural networks despite their nonconvexity and nonlinear decision boundaries. Moreover, this training method induces the first deep active learning scheme known to achieve convergence guarantees, revealing a geometric contraction rate of the feasible set. We exemplify the effectiveness of our proposed active learning method against popular deep active learning baselines via both synthetic data experiments and sentimental classification task on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>
