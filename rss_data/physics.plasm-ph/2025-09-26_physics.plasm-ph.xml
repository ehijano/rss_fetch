      <title>Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates random, charge-neutral, large density fluctuations $\delta \rho/\rho \gg 1$, and corresponding random fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$. Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random, time-varying, self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Reply to "Comments to Marvel Fusions Mixed Fuels Reactor Concept"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "arXiv:2312.13429" Lackner et al. use standard methods to decide if it is possible to ignite mixed fuels. They correctly identify that the increased radiation losses make ignition significantly more challenging than for pure DT fuels, since this leads to higher ignition temperatures. Further, they conclude that at those temperatures the reduced electronic $\alpha$-stopping makes ignition impossible. We show that this conclusion is not correct. The model used for $\alpha$-stopping by Lackner et al. is only approximately correct for low temperatures and hydrogen isotopes. By extending the $\alpha$-stopping model to include ionic $\alpha$-stopping we show in \cite{ruhlkornarXiv5} that the contribution of ionic $\alpha$-particle stopping cannot be neglected. The ionic $\alpha$-stopping together with the neutron stopping, which is also neglected by Lackner et al., lead to elevated ion temperatures implying $kT_i &gt; kT_e$. Those three effects combined lead us to the conclusion, that ignition of mixed fuels is indeed possible with far reaching implications, contrary to the analysis by Lackner.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Nanoflare Energy and Frequency through Field Line Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a 3D MHD simulation of a subset of the magnetic flux in an active region. The simulation models the generation of nanoflares and response of the plasma to imposed photospheric motions. Our study focuses on characterizing the energy distribution and occurrence frequency of the nanoflares in the simulation that self-consistently heat the corona. This field line based analysis reveals that the nanoflare energy distribution (energy per unit cross sectional area) follows a log-normal profile, where low energy nanoflares are significantly more prevalent than those with high energy. When compared with the plasma cooling time, different energy nanoflares tend to repeat with different frequencies. Low energy nanoflares repeat at high frequencies, while high energy nanoflares repeat at low frequencies. However, the thermal evolution of plasma along individual field lines is governed predominantly by the high energy nanoflares. These findings provide critical insights into the role of small-scale magnetic reconnection events in heating the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Heating in the Sub-Alfv\'enic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless dissipation of turbulence is important for heating plasmas in astrophysical, space physics, and laboratory environments, controlling energy, momentum and particle transport. We analyze Parker Solar Probe observations to understand the collisionless heating of the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind, which is connected to the solar corona. Our results show that linear resonant heating through parallel-propagating cyclotron waves cannot account for turbulent dissipation in sub-Alfv\'enic region, which observations suggest may dissipate turbulence at distances further from the Sun. Instead, we find that stochastic heating can account for the observed ion energization; however, because the dominant contributions arise from infrequent, large-amplitude events, turbulent intermittency must be explicitly incorporated. These observations directly connect stochastic heating via breaking of the proton magnetic moment with the intermittent and inhomogeneous heating of turbulence reported in many previous studies. Our identification of stochastic heating as a dynamic mechanism responsible for intermittent heating of the solar wind has significant implications for turbulent dissipation in the lower corona, other astrophysical environments, and laboratory plasma.</description>

      <title>First Electron Acceleration in a Tunable-Velocity Laser Wakefield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>
