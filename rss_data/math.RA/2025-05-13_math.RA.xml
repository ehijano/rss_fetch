      <title>Further remarks on $z$-ideals of semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we revisit certain results from a previous work of the second author concerning $z$-ideals of semirings. We demonstrate that the assumption of the semiring being a bzi-semiring can be dispensed with. Additionally, we propose a revised definition of the $z$-radical that enables a more general formulation of results from the earlier work.</description>

      <title>Images of polynomial maps and the Ax-Grothendieck theorem over algebraically closed division rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the images of polynomial maps over algebraically closed division rings. Our first result generalizes the classical Ax-Grothendieck theorem: We show that if $ f_1, \ldots, f_m $ are elements of the free associative algebra $ D\langle X_1, \ldots, X_m \rangle $ generated by $ m \geq 1 $ variables over an algebraically closed division ring $ D $ of finite dimension over its center $ F $, and if the induced map $ f = (f_1, \ldots, f_m) \colon D^m \to D^m $ is injective, then $ f $ must be surjective. With no condition on the dimension over the center, our second result is that $ p(D) = D $ if $ p $ is either an element in $ F\langle X_1, \ldots, X_m \rangle $ with zero constant term such that $ p(F) \neq \{0\} $, or a nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$. Furthermore, we also establish some Waring type results. For instance, for any integer $ n &gt; 1 $, we prove that every matrix in $ \mathrm{M}_n(D) $ can be expressed as a difference of pairs of multiplicative commutators of elements from $ p(\mathrm{M}_n(D)) $, provided again that $ D $ is finite-dimensional over $ F $.</description>

      <title>Generalized Degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups in geometric (Clifford) algebras. These Lie groups preserve the direct sums of the subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations in degenerate geometric algebras. We prove that the generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups can be defined using centralizers and twisted centralizers of fixed grades subspaces and the norm functions that are widely used in the theory of spin groups. We study the relations between these groups and consider them in the particular cases of plane-based geometric algebras and Grassmann algebras. The corresponding Lie algebras are studied. The presented groups are interesting for the study of generalized degenerate spin groups and applications in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Polynomial invariants for 3-dimensional Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every 3-dimensional non-Lie Leibniz algebras over complex numbers we describe the algebra of polynomial invariants and the group of automorphisms. As a consequence, we establish that two non-nilpotent 3-dimensional non-Lie Leibniz algebras can be distinguished by means of the traces of degrees $\leqslant2$ and the dimensions of groups of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Varieties of group-graded algebras of proper central exponent greater than two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $ \mathcal V $ be a variety of associative $F$-algebras graded by a finite abelian group $G$. To a variety $ \mathcal V $ is associated a numerical sequence called the sequence of proper central $G$-codimensions, $c^{G,\delta}_n(\mathcal V), \, n \ge 1.$ Here $c^{G,\delta}_n(\mathcal V)$ is the dimension of the space of multilinear proper central $G$-polynomials in $n$ fixed variables of any algebra $A$ generating the variety $\mathcal V.$
  Such sequence gives information on the growth of the proper central $G$-polynomials of $A$ and in \cite{LMR} it was proved that $exp^{G,\delta}(\mathcal V)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{c_n^{G,\delta}(\mathcal V)}$ exists and is an integer called the proper central $G$-exponent.
  The aim of this paper is to characterize the varieties of associative
  $G$-graded algebras of proper central $G$-exponent greater than two.
  To this end we construct a finite list of $G$-graded algebras and we prove that $exp^{G,\delta}(\mathcal V) &gt;2$ if and only if at least one of the algebras belongs to $\mathcal V$.
  Matching this result with the characterization of the varieties of almost polynomial growth given in \cite{GLP}, we obtain a characterization of the varieties of proper central $G$-exponent equal to two.</description>

      <title>Global structure behind pointwise equivalences of noncommutative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interplay between local and global equivalences on noncommutative polynomials, the elements of the free algebra. When the latter are viewed as functions in several matrix variables, a local equivalence of noncommutative polynomials refers to their values sharing a common feature point-wise on matrix tuples of all dimensions, such as rank-equivalence (values have the same ranks), isospectrality (values have the same spectrum), and pointwise similarity (values are similar). On the other hand, a global equivalence refers to a ring-theoretic relation within the free algebra, such as stable association or (elementary) intertwinedness. This paper identifies the most ubiquitous pairs of local and global equivalences. Namely, rank-equivalence coincides with stable association, isospectrality coincides with both intertwinedness and transitive closure of elementary intertwinedness, and pointwise similarity coincides with equality. Using these characterizations, further results on spectral radii and norms of values of noncommutative polynomials are derived.</description>

      <title>On left nilpotent skew braces of class 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this article is to initiate a detailed structure theory of left nilpotent skew braces $B$ of class $2$, i.e. skew braces with $B^3 = 0$. We prove that if $B$ is of nilpotent type, then $B$ is centrally nilpotent. In fact, we show that $B$ is right nilpotent of class at most $2+mr$, i.e. $B^{(2+mr+1)} = 0$, where $m$ and $r$ are the nilpotency classes of the additive group of $B$ and $B^2$, respectively. If $B$ is of abelian type, then $B$ is actually right nilpotent of class $3$, i.e. $B^{(4)} = 0$, and this bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Generically-constrained quantum isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact quantum group $\mathrm{G}$ and denote by $\mathrm{G}_W$ the isotropy subgroup of a linear subspace $W\le V$ regarded as a point in the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(V)$. We show that the space of those $W\in \mathbb{G}(V)$ for which $\mathrm{G}_W$ acts trivially on $W$ (or $V$) is open in the Zariski topology of the Weil restriction $\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{G}(V)$. More generally, this holds for the space of $W$ for which (a) the $\mathrm{G}_W$-action factors through its abelianization, or (b) the summands of the $\mathrm{G}_W$-representation on $W$ (or $V$) are otherwise dimensionally constrained.
  The results generalize analogous classical generic rigidity statements useful in establishing the triviality of the classical automorphism groups of random quantum graphs in the matrix algebra $M_n$, and can be put to similar use in fully non-commutative versions of those results (quantum graphs, quantum groups).</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field.</description>

      <title>Flatness in finitely accessible additive categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by some problems proposed by Cuadra and Simson related to flat objects in finitely accessible Grothendieck categories, we study flatness in the more general setting of finitely accessible additive categories. For such category $\mathcal{A}$, we characterize when $\mathcal{A}$ is preabelian and abelian. We prove that if the class of flat objects in $\mathcal A$ is closed under pure subobjects, then every flat object is a direct union of \textit{small} flat subobjects. Finally, we characterize when $\mathcal{A}$ has enough flat and projective objects and we prove that, in this case, the class of flat objects is closed under pure subobjects.</description>

Abstract: We completely characterize when the algebra of an ample groupoid with coefficients in an arbitrary unital ring is von Neumann regular and, more generally, when the algebra of a graded ample groupoid is graded von Neumann regular. Our main application is to resolve the question, open since 1970, of when the algebra of an inverse semigroup is von Neumann regular. As applications, we recover known results on regularity and graded regularity of Leavitt path algebras, and prove a number of new results, in particular concerning graded regularity of algebras of Deaconu-Renault groupoids and Nekrashevych-Exel-Pardo algebras of self-similar groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study majorization for probability distributions and column stochastic matrices. We show that majorizations in general can be reduced to the aforementioned sets. We characterize linear operators that preserve majorization for probability distributions, and show their equivalence to operators preserving vector majorization. Our main result provides a complete characterization of linear preservers of strong majorization for column stochastic matrices, revealing a richer structure of preservers than in the standard setting. As a prerequisite to this characterization, we solve the problem of characterizing linear preservers of majorization for zero-sum vectors, which yields a new structural insight into the classical results of Ando and of Li and Poon.</description>

Abstract: $A_3$-associative algebra is a generalization of associative algebra and is one of the four remarkable types of Lie-admissible algebras, along with associative algebra, left-symmetric algebra and right-symmetric algebra. This paper develops bialgebra theory for $A_3$-associative algebras. We introduce Manin triples and bialgebras for $A_3$-associative algebras, prove their equivalence using matched pairs of $A_3$-associative algebras, and define the $A_3$-associative Yang-Baxter equation and triangular $A_3$-associative bialgebras. Additionally, we introduce relative Rota-Baxter operators to provide skew-symmetric solutions of the $A_3$-associative Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we prove that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds for $A$. We further construct a semidirect product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, and establish the correspondence between equivariant sheaves on the representation space and left $A\rtimes\mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, using the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Venkatesh extended the category equivalence between affine algebraic groups and Harish-Chandra pairs, which was proved by the author in the supersymmetric context, to the situation of the Verlinde category in positive characteristic. But the proof is incomplete at some basic point, the author thinks. Amending that we refine the result. Our construction of an affine algebraic group scheme from a Harish-Chandra pair, which uses functor points and formal group schemes, is more conceptual and simpler than the known ones of the existing literature. In the same situation we prove tensor product decomposition of commutative Hopf algebras not necessarily of finite type, which is new.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, extending the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Among our main results, we show that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra. We also describe a process of disintegration of modules and use it to prove a version of the Effros-Hahn conjecture, showing that every primitive ideal coincides with the annihilator of a module induced from isotropy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a formulation of the moduli problem for rank-2 algebras over general base rings in functorial terms, providing presentations as presheaf quotients of affine schemes by group scheme actions.</description>
