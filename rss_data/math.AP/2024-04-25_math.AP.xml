      <title>Symmetry results for a nonlocal eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal constant in the nonlocal Poincar\'e-Wirtinger inequality in $(a,b)\subset\mathbb R$: \begin{equation*} \lambda_\alpha(p,q,r){\left(\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{q}dx\right)^\frac pq}\le{\int_{a}^{b}|u'|^{p}dx+\alpha\left|\int_{a}^{b}|u|^{r-2}u\, dx\right|^{\frac p{r-1}}}, \end{equation*} where $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, $p,q,r &gt;1$ such that $\frac 45 p\le q\le p$ and $\frac q2 +1\le r \le q+\frac q p$. This problem can be casted as a nonlocal minimum problem, whose Euler-Lagrange associated equation contains an integral term of the unknown function over the whole interval of definition. Furthermore, the problem can be also seen as an eigenvalue problem.
  We show that there exists a critical value $\alpha_C=\alpha_C (p,q,r)$ such that the minimizers are even with constant sign when $\alpha\le\alpha_{C}$ and are odd when $\alpha\geq \alpha_{C}$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dissipation and blow-up suppression for an aggregation equation with fractional diffusion and shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an aggregation equation with fractional diffusion and large shear flow, which arise from modelling chemotaxis in bacteria. Without the advection, the solution of aggregation equation may blow up in finite time. First, we study the enhanced dissipation of shear flow by resolvent estimate method, where the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ is considered and $\alpha\in (0,2)$. Next, we show that the enhanced dissipation of shear flow can suppress blow-up of solution to aggregation equation with fractional diffusion and establish global classical solution in the case of $\alpha\geq 3/2$. Here we develop some new technical to overcome the difficult of low regularity for fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Unconditional well-posedness for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in Bessel potential spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is called unconditionally well posed in a data space $E$ if it is well posed in the usual sense and the solution is unique in the space $C([0,T]; E)$. In this paper, this notion of unconditional well-posedness is redefined so that it covers $L^p$-based Sobolev spaces as data space $E$ and it is equivalent to the usual one when $E$ is an $L^2$-based Sobolev space $H^s$. Next, based on this definition, it is shown that the Cauchy problem for the 1D cubic NLS is unconditionally well posed in Bessel potential spaces $H^s_p$ for $4/3&lt;p\le 2$ under certain regularity assumptions on $s$.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of $L^2$-supercritical NLS equations on noncompact metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence of normalized solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on noncompact metric graphs in the $L^2$ supercritical regime. For sufficiently small prescribed mass ($L^2$ norm), we prove existence of positive solutions on two classes of graphs: periodic graphs, and noncompact graphs with finitely many edges and suitable topological assumptions. Our approach is based on mountain pass techniques. A key point to overcome the serious lack of compactness is to show that all solutions with small mass have positive energy. To complement our analysis, we prove that this is no longer true, in general, for large masses. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results with an $L^2$ supercritical nonlinearity extended on the whole graph and unraveling the role of topology in the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Inverse modified scattering and polyhomogeneous expansions for the Vlasov--Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof of well posedness of the inverse modified scattering problem for the Vlasov--Poisson system: for every suitable scattering profile there exists a solution of Vlasov--Poisson which disperses and scatters, in a modified sense, to this profile. Further, as a consequence of the proof, the solutions are shown to admit a polyhomogeneous expansion, to any finite but arbitrarily high order, with coefficients given explicitly in terms of the scattering profile. The proof does not exploit the full ellipticity of the Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Choquard equations with critical exponential nonlinearities in the zero mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Choquard equations in $\mathbb R^N$ driven by a weighted $N$-Laplace operator and with polynomial kernel and zero mass. Since the setting is limiting for the Sobolev embedding, we work with nonlinearities which may grow up to the critical exponential. We establish existence of a positive solution by variational methods, completing the analysis in [Romani, ArXiv preprint 2023], where the case of a logarithmic kernel was considered.</description>

      <title>Improvement of flatness for nonlocal free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study for the first time the regularity of the free boundary in the one-phase free boundary problem driven by a general nonlocal operator. Our main results establish that the free boundary is $C^{1,\alpha}$ near regular points, and that the set of regular free boundary points is open and dense. Moreover, in 2D we classify all blow-up limits and prove that the free boundary is $C^{1,\alpha}$ everywhere. The main technical tool of our proof is an improvement of flatness scheme, which we establish in the general framework of viscosity solutions, and which is of independent interest. All of these results were only known for the fractional Laplacian, and are completely new for general nonlocal operators. In contrast to previous works on the fractional Laplacian, our method of proof is purely nonlocal in nature.</description>

      <title>A proof of Vishik's nonuniqueness Theorem for the forced 2D Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simpler proof of Vishik's nonuniqueness Theorem for the forced 2D Euler equation in the vorticity class $L^1\cap L^p$ with $2&lt;p&lt;\infty$. The main simplification is an alternative construction of a smooth and compactly supported unstable vortex, which is split into two steps: Firstly, we construct a piecewise constant unstable vortex, and secondly, we find a regularization through a fixed point argument. This simpler structure of the unstable vortex yields a simplification of the other parts of Vishik's proof.</description>

      <title>Computation of leaky waves in layered structures coupled to unbounded media by exploiting multiparameter eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytical approach to compute quasi-guided elastic wave modes in horizontally layered structures radiating into unbounded fluid or solid media. This problem is of relevance, e.g., for the simulation of guided ultrasound in embedded plate structures or seismic waves in soil layers over an elastic half-space. We employ a semi-analytical formulation to describe the layers, thus discretizing the thickness direction by means of finite elements. For a free layer, this technique leads to a well-known quadratic eigenvalue problem for the mode shapes and corresponding horizontal wavenumbers. Rigorously incorporating the coupling conditions to account for the adjacent half-spaces gives rise to additional terms that are nonlinear in the wavenumber. We show that the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem can be cast in the form of a multiparameter eigenvalue problem whose solutions represent the wave numbers in the plate and in the half-spaces. The multiparameter eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using recently developed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering rigidity problem in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation known on a lateral timelike boundary. We show that one can recover the jet of the metric up to a gauge transformation near a lightlike strictly convex point. Assuming that the metric is real analytic, we show that one can recover the metric up to a gauge transformation as well near such a point.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Estimates on Conformally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental gap is the difference between the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of a Schr\"odinger operator (and the Laplacian, in particular). For horoconvex domains in hyperbolic space, Nguyen, Stancu and Wei conjectured that it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the fundamental gap in terms of the diameter of the domain and the dimension [IMRN2022]. In this article, we prove this conjecture by establishing conformal log-concavity estimates for the first eigenfunction. This builds off earlier work by the authors and Saha as well as recent work by Cho, Wei and Yang. We also prove spectral gap estimates for a more general class of problems on conformally flat manifolds and investigate the relationship between the gap and the inradius. For example, we establish gap estimates for domains in $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ which are convex with respect to the universal affine cover</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with bilinear estimates and uniqueness of mild solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations in critical spaces. For that, we construct general settings in which estimates for the bilinear term of the mild formulation hold true without using auxiliary norms such as Kato time-weighted ones. We first obtain necessary conditions in abstract critical spaces and then consider further structures to obtain the estimates in general classes of Besov, Morrey and Besov-Morrey spaces based on Banach spaces. Examples of applications are provided in different spaces as well as for other PDEs. In particular, as far as we know, the bilinear estimate and the uniqueness property obtained in the framework of Besov-weak-Herz spaces are not available in the existing literature. The proofs are mainly based on characterizations and estimates on the corresponding predual spaces.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequalities, the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman formula, and Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$ conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove quantitative spectral inequalities for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_B$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_B \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>

      <title>On a Quasilinear Parabolic-Hyperbolic System Arising in MEMS Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coupled system consisting of a quasilinear parabolic equation and a semilinear hyperbolic equation is considered. The problem arises as a small aspect ratio limit in the modeling of a MEMS device taking into account the gap width of the device and the gas pressure. The system is regarded as a special case of a more general setting for which local well-posedness of strong solutions is shown. The general result applies to different cases including a coupling of the parabolic equation to a semilinear wave equation of either second or fourth order, the latter featuring either clamped or pinned boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous regularization of measure-valued population densities in a Keller--Segel system with flux limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Keller--Segel system with flux limitation,
  \begin{align} \tag{$\ast$} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u - \nabla \cdot (uf(|\nabla v|^{2})\nabla v), \\ v_t=\Delta v - v + u \end{cases} \end{align} in bounded $n$-dimensional domains with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, where $f$ generalizes the prototype obtained on letting \[
f(\xi) = k_f(1 + \xi)^{-\alpha}, \quad \xi \ge 0, \] with $k_f &gt; 0$ and $\alpha &gt; 0$. In this framework, it is shown that if either $n = 1$ and $\alpha &gt; 0$ is arbitrary, or $n \ge 2$ and $\alpha &gt; \frac{n-2}{2(n-1)}$, then for any nonnegative initial data belonging to the space of Radon measures for the population density and to $W^{1,q}$ with $q \in (\max\{1, (1-2\alpha)n\}, \frac{n}{n-1})$ for the signal density, there exists a global classical solution of the Neumann problem for $(\ast)$, which is continuous at $t = 0$ in an appropriate sense.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric steady Navier-Stokes flows under suction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of solutions for the axisymmetric steady Navier-Stokes system around an infinite cylinder under external forces. The solutions are constructed to be decaying at the horizontal infinity, despite an analogue of the Stokes paradox for the linearized system, and having neither periodicity nor decay in the vertical direction. The proof is based on perturbation of the nonlinear system around a suction flow. The class of functions in this paper, which is a subspace of the space of Fourier transformed vector finite Radon measures, is inspired by Giga-Saal (2013) treating rotating boundary layers.</description>

      <title>Wave-front tracking for a quasi-linear scalar conservation law with hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we deal with the Cauchy problem for the quasi-linear scalar conservation law \[u_t+ {\cal F}(u)_t+u_x=0,\] where ${\cal F}$ is a specific hysteresis operator, namely the Play operator. Hysteresis models a rate-independent memory relationship between the input $u$ and its output. Its presence in the partial differential equation gives a particular non-local feature to the latter allowing us to capture phenomena that may arise in some application fields. Riemann problems and the interactions between shock lines are studied and via the so-called Wave-Front Tracking method a solution to the Cauchy problem with bounded variation initial data is constructed. The solution found satisfies an entropy-like condition, making it the unique solution in the class of entropy admissible ones.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of solutions to parabolic problems with a potential on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nonexistence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions to a class of semilinear parabolic equations with a positive potential, posed on weighted graphs. Assuming an upper bound on the Laplacian of the distance and a suitable weighted space-time volume growth condition, we show that no global solutions exists. We also discuss the optimality of the hypotheses, thus recovering a critical exponent phenomenon of Fujita type.</description>

      <title>Smoothability of $L^p$-connections on bundles and isometric immersions with $W^{2,p}$-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with two interrelated problems: smoothability of connection 1-forms with low regularity on bundles with prescribed smooth curvature 2-forms, and existence of isometric immersions with low regularity. We first show that if $\Omega$ is an $L^p$-connection $1$-form on a vector bundle over a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with small $L^p$-norm ($p&gt;n$) and smooth curvature $2$-form $\mathscr{F}$, then $\Omega$ can be approximated in the $L^p_{\rm loc}$-topology by smooth connections of the same curvature (not necessarily gauge equivalent). Our proof, adapted from S. Mardare's work on the fundamental theory of surfaces with $L^p$-second fundamental form, is elementary in nature and uses only Hodge decomposition and fixed point theorems. This result is then applied to the study of isometric immersions of Riemannian manifolds with low regularity. We revisit the proof for the existence of $W^{2,p}$-isometric immersion $\mathcal{M}^n \to \mathbf{R}^{n+k}$ with arbitrary $n$ and $k$ given weak solutions to the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations, aiming at elucidating some global vs. local issues, and also we provide a characterisation for metrics on $\mathcal{M}$ that admit $W^{2,p}$- but no $C^\infty$-isometric immersions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Almost-Complex Curves in $\hat{\mathbb{S}}^{2,4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For solutions to the $\mathfrak{g}_2$ affine Toda field equations in $\mathbb{C}$ with respect to \emph{polynomial} holomorphic sextic differential $q$, we study the associated almost-complex curves $\nu_q: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{S}}^{2,4}$. The asymptotic boundary $\Delta := \partial_{\infty}(\nu_q)$ of $\nu_q$ is found to be a polygon in $\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3}$ with $\mathsf{deg} q + 6$ vertices. The polygon $\Delta$ satisfies an \emph{annihilator property}, which is related to a $\mathsf{G}_2'$-invariant discrete metric $d_3: \mathsf{Ein}^{2,3} \times \mathsf{Ein}^{2,3} \rightarrow \{0,1,2,3\}$ on $\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3}$. In fact, we show $\mathsf{G}_2' = \mathsf{Isom}(d_3) \cap \mathsf{Diff}(\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3})$. The asymptotic boundary defines a map $\alpha: \mathsf{MS}_{k} \rightarrow \mathsf{MP}_{k+6}$ between the equidimensional moduli spaces of holomorphic polynomial sextic differentials of degree $k$ and of annihilator polygons with $k+6$ vertices and is conjectured to be a homeomorphism onto its image. We also discuss the relationship between $\nu_q$ and a related minimal surface $f_q: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathsf{G}_2'/K$ in the symmetric space $\mathsf{G}_2'/K$, showing how to realize their mutual harmonic lift to $\mathsf{G}_2'/T$ geometrically. Before beginning the geometry, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a complete (real) solution to the $\mathfrak{g}_2$ affine Toda field equations in $\mathbb{C}$ associated to polynomial $q \in H^0(\mathcal{K}_\mathbb{C}^6)$.</description>
