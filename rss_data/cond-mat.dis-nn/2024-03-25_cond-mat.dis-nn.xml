      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects.
  In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities.
  Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent covariance reveals critical spatio-temporal patterns of synchronized activity in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining advanced theoretical techniques and high-quality data from thousands of simultaneously recorded neurons provide strong support for the hypothesis that neural dynamics operate near the edge of instability across regions in the brain. However, these analyses, as well as related studies, often fail to capture the intricate temporal structure of brain activity as they primarily rely on time-integrated measurements across neurons. In this study, we present a novel framework designed to explore signatures of criticality across diverse frequency bands and construct a much more comprehensive description of brain activity. Additionally, we introduce a method for projecting brain activity onto a basis of spatio-temporal patterns, facilitating time-dependent dimensionality reduction. Applying this framework to a magnetoencephalography dataset, we observe significant differences in both criticality signatures and spatio-temporal activity patterns between healthy subjects and individuals with Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Effect: Symmetry Breaking, Twisting, and Giant Disorder Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Random Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Random Language Model (De Giuli 2019) is an ensemble of stochastic context-free grammars, quantifying the syntax of human and computer languages. The model suggests a simple picture of first language learning as a type of annealing in the vast space of potential languages. In its simplest formulation, it implies a single continuous transition to grammatical syntax, at which the symmetry among potential words and categories is spontaneously broken. Here this picture is scrutinized by considering its robustness against extensions of the original model, and trajectories through parameter space different from those originally considered. It is shown here that (i) the scenario is robust to explicit symmetry breaking, an inevitable component of learning in the real world; and (ii) the transition to grammatical syntax can be encountered by fixing the deep (hidden) structure while varying the surface (observable) properties. It is also argued that the transition becomes a sharp thermodynamic transition in an idealized limit. Moreover, comparison with human data on the clustering coefficient of syntax networks suggests that the observed transition is equivalent to that normally experienced by children at age 24 months. The results are discussed in light of theory of first-language acquisition in linguistics, and recent successes in machine learning.</description>
