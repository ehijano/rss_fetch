      <title>Learning the liveability of cities from migrants: Combinatiorial-Hodge-theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration is a major decision to leave one place and move to another, and involves job and life changes. The migration flow of people provides relational information across places about which is better to live by ``voting with their feet'' (Tiebout, 1956; Douglas, 1997). From the people's votes, in a ``democratic'' process, we quantify a descriptive statistic of liveable cities by a potential of migration flow in Combinatorial Hodge theory. As a case study, we measure the liveability of municipalities in Japan for specific populations such as families with small children and women of reproductive age. Using these potentials as dependent variables, we perform a regression analysis to identify the factors relevant to liveability. Additionally, using the aformentioned theoretical framework, we analytically derive the expression of the utility as a function of given flow data, which was numerically estimated in previous studies (Douglas &amp; Wall, 1993; Douglas, 1997; Douglas &amp; Wall, 2000; Wall, 2001; Nakajima &amp; Tabuchi, 2011). The proposed method extracts a consistent metric of interval scale from the non-transitive, pairwise comparison between locations and provides valuable statistics for urban planning by policymakers.</description>

      <title>Social norm dynamics in a behavioral epidemic model on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the social determinants influencing preventive measures adoption during epidemics is crucial for effective disease modeling and policy making. While traditional epidemic models focused on rational decision-making and psychological biases, recent studies highlight the role of social norms. We develop a behavioral epidemic model on a multiplex network, by integrating an Experience Weighted Attractor (EWA) learning mechanism and social norm dynamics. Incorporating social norms in our decision-making mechanism significantly reduces final infected fractions, offering an alternative to altruism for boosting vaccination coverage. Furthermore, we examine the importance of the dynamics of each one of the social norms, injunctive or descriptive, in reducing the infected fraction, finding that the former has a more significant effect in agreement with some experimental evidence. We also explore the effect of external interventions on epidemic expansion, aiding in refining public communication protocols. Enhanced models of social norm dynamics, if validated and tested, can better capture the complexities of human social behavior and mitigate various societal challenges beyond pandemics.</description>

      <title>COVID-19's Unequal Toll: An assessment of small business impact disparities with respect to ethnorace in metropolitan areas in the US using mobility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early in the pandemic, counties and states implemented a variety of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) focused on mobility, such as national lockdowns or work-from-home strategies, as it became clear that restricting movement was essential to containing the epidemic. Due to these restrictions, businesses were severely affected and in particular, small, urban restaurant businesses. In addition to that, COVID-19 has also amplified many of the socioeconomic disparities and systemic racial inequities that exist in our society. The overarching objective of this study was to examine the changes in small urban restaurant visitation patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated mobility restrictions, as well as to uncover potential disparities across different racial/ethnic groups in order to understand inequities in the impact and recovery. Specifically, the two key objectives were: 1) to analyze the overall changes in restaurant visitation patterns in US metropolitan areas during the pandemic compared to a pre-pandemic baseline, and 2) to investigate differences in visitation pattern changes across Census Block Groups with majority Asian, Black, Hispanic, White, and American Indian populations, identifying any disproportionate effects. Using aggregated geolocated cell phone data from SafeGraph, we document the overall changes in small urban restaurant businesses' visitation patterns with respect to racial composition at a granularity of Census Block Groups. Our results show clear indications of reduced visitation patterns after the pandemic, with slow recoveries. Via visualizations and statistical analyses, we show that reductions in visitation patterns were the highest for small urban restaurant businesses in majority Asian neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of Campus Population Behaviors for Pandemic Response Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports a case study of an application of high-resolution agent-based modeling and simulation to pandemic response planning on a university campus. In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus. These results were reported to the university administration and utilized in the pandemic response planning, which led to successful outcomes.</description>

      <title>Estimating transmission noise on networks from stationary local order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study networks of nodes characterised by binary traits that change both endogenously and through nearest-neighbour interaction. Our analytical results show that those traits can be ranked according to the noisiness of their transmission using only measures of order in the stationary state. Crucially, this ranking is independent of network topology. As an example, we explain why, in line with a long-standing hypothesis, the relative stability of the structural traits of languages can be estimated from their geospatial distribution. We conjecture that similar inferences may be possible in a more general class of Markovian systems. Consequently, in many empirical domains where longitudinal information is not easily available the propensities of traits to change could be estimated from spatial data alone.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Impact of Social Distance Policy in Mitigating COVID-19 Spread with Factor-Based Imputation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the effectiveness of social distancing policies in reducing the transmission of the COVID-19 spread. We build a model that measures the relative frequency and geographic distribution of the virus growth rate and provides hypothetical infection distribution in the states that enacted the social distancing policies, where we control time-varying, observed and unobserved, state-level heterogeneities. Using panel data on infection and deaths in all US states from February 20 to April 20, 2020, we find that stay-at-home orders and other types of social distancing policies significantly reduced the growth rate of infection and deaths. We show that the effects are time-varying and range from the weakest at the beginning of policy intervention to the strongest by the end of our sample period. We also found that social distancing policies were more effective in states with higher income, better education, more white people, more democratic voters, and higher CNN viewership.</description>

      <title>Proximity Ascertainment Bias in Early Covid Case Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparison of the distances to the Huanan Seafood Market of early Covid cases with known links to the market versus cases without known links shows results apparently incompatible with a location model lacking proximity ascertainment bias. The sign of the difference instead agrees with a model in which such ascertainment bias is large. In the presence of such bias inferences based on the clustering of case locations become unreliable.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through creative decomposition strategies. More broadly, our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>
