      <title>Revisiting ancient noncollapsed flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we give a new proof of the classification theorem for noncompact ancient noncollapsed flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$ originally due to Brendle-Choi (Inventiones 2019). Our new proof directly establishes selfsimilarity by combining the fine neck theorem from our joint work with Hershkovits and the rigidity case of Hamilton's Harnack inequality.</description>

      <title>Curvature of Measure-Preserving Diffeomorphism Groups of Non-Orientable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study curvatures of the groups of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms of non-orientable compact surfaces. For the cases of the Klein bottle and the real projective plane we compute curvatures, their asymptotics and the normalized Ricci curvatures in many directions. Extending the approach of V. Arnold, and A. Lukatskii we provide estimates of weather unpredictability for natural models of trade wind currents on the Klein bottle and the projective plane.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Results Involving Stabilized Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigidity theorem for Brendle and Hung's recent systolic inequality, which involves Gromov's notion of \(T^{\rtimes}\)-stabilized scalar curvature. Our primary technique is the construction of foliations by free boundary weighted constant mean curvature hypersurfaces, enabling us to generalize several classical scalar curvature rigidity results to the \(T^{\rtimes}\)-stabilized setting. Additionally, we develop a monotone quantity using Ricci flow coupled with a heat equation, which is essential for rigidity analysis.</description>

      <title>The large scale structure of complete $4$-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the implications of our joint work with E. Bru\`e and A. Pigati on the structure of blow-downs for a smooth, complete, Riemannian $4$-manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth. Very imprecisely, any such manifold looks like a cone over a spherical space form at infinity. We present some open questions and discuss possible future directions along the way.</description>

      <title>Spectral invariants of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Witten-Laplacian with potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact connected Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary, we establish an effective procedure, by which we can calculate all the coefficients of the spectral asymptotic formula of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated to the Witten-Laplacian with potential. In particular, by computing the full symbol of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map we explicitly give the first four coefficients. They are spectral invariants, which provide precise information concerning the volume, curvatures, drifting function and potential.</description>

      <title>Synthetic notions of Ricci flow for metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop different synthetic notions of Ricci flow in the setting of time-dependent metric measure spaces based on ideas from optimal transport. They are formulated in terms of dynamic convexity and local concavity of the entropy along Wasserstein geodesics on the one hand and in terms of global and short-time asymptotic transport cost estimates for the heat flow on the other hand. We show that these properties characterise smooth (weighted) Ricci flows. Further, we investigate the relation between the different notions in the non-smooth setting of time-dependent metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Distance Measure Based on an Embedding of the Manifold of K-Component Gaussian Mixture Models into the Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a distance between the Gaussian Mixture Models(GMMs) is obtained based on an embedding of the K-component Gaussian Mixture Model into the manifold of the symmetric positive definite matrices. Proof of embedding of K-component GMMs into the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices is given and shown that it is a submanifold. Then, proved that the manifold of GMMs with the pullback of induced metric is isometric to the submanifold with the induced metric. Through this embedding we obtain a general lower bound for the Fisher-Rao metric. This lower bound is a distance measure on the manifold of GMMs and we employ it for the similarity measure of GMMs. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through an experiment on standard machine learning benchmarks, achieving accuracy of 98%, 92%, and 93.33% on the UIUC, KTH-TIPS, and UMD texture recognition datasets respectively.</description>

      <title>Weyl metrizability of 3-dimensional projective structures and CR submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A projective structure is Weyl metrizable if it has a representative that preserves a conformal structure. We interpret Weyl metrizability of 3-dimensional projective structures as certain 5-dimensional nondegenerate CR submanifolds in a class of 7-dimensional 2-nondegenerate CR structures. As a corollary, it follows that in dimension three Beltrami's theorem extends to conformal structures, i.e. a flat projective structure is Weyl metrizable exclusively with respect to a flat conformal structure. In higher dimensions it is shown that conformal Beltrami theorem remains true as well.</description>

      <title>An inversion formula for the X-ray normal operator over closed hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit inversion formula for Guillarmou's normal operator on closed surfaces of constant negative curvature. This normal operator can be defined as a weak limit for an "attenuated normal operator", and we prove this inversion formula by first constructing an additional inversion formula for this attenuated normal operator on both the Poincar\'e disk and closed surfaces of constant negative curvature. A consequence of the inversion formula is the explicit construction of invariant distributions with prescribed pushforward over closed hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider uniformly semi-locally 1-connected sequences of closed connected Riemannian 2-manifolds. In particular, we assume that the manifolds are homeomorphic to each other and that their total absolute curvature is uniformly bounded. The purpose of this paper is a description of the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such sequences. Our work extends earlier investigations by Burago and Shioya.</description>

      <title>Constructing Riemannian metrics with prescribed nodal sets for Laplacian eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ ovals in $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that there is a Riemannian metric $g$ over $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a Laplacian eigenfunction whose zero set is $C$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the $k$-th eigenvalue for $n\leq k \leq \alpha_1 n$. We also have that $\lambda\operatorname{Vol}_g\left(\mathbb{S}^2\right) = \Theta(n)$.
  Additionally, assuming $C$ can be drawn as a topological minor of the $m\times m$ grid graph, we show that there is an infinitesimal perturbation of the round metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a corresponding Laplacian eigenfunction $f$ with eigenvalue $\Theta(m^2)$ such that the zero set of $f$ is equivalent to $C$.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity-one solitons in Laplacian flow: local, smoothly-closing and steady solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of cohomogeneity-one solitons in Bryant's Laplacian flow of closed G_2-structures on a 7-manifold, motivated by the problem of understanding finite-time singularities of that flow. Here we focus on solitons with symmetry groups Sp(2) and SU(3); in both cases we prove the existence of continuous families of local cohomogeneity-one gradient Laplacian solitons and characterise which of these local solutions extend smoothly over their unique singular orbits. The main questions are then to determine which of these smoothly-closing solutions extend to complete solitons and furthermore to understand the asymptotic geometry of these complete solitons.
  We provide complete answers to both questions in the case of steady solitons. Up to the actions of scaling and discrete symmetries, we show that the set of all smoothly-closing SU(3)-invariant steady Laplacian solitons defined on a neighbourhood of the zero-section of the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2 is parametrised by the set of nonnegative reals. An open interval I=(0,c) corresponds to complete nontrivial gradient solitons that are asymptotic to the unique SU(3)-invariant torsion-free G_2 cone. The boundary point 0 of I corresponds to the well-known Bryant--Salamon asymptotically conical G_2-manifold, while the other boundary point c corresponds to an explicit complete gradient steady soliton with exponential volume growth and novel asymptotic geometry. The open interval (c, oo) consists entirely of incomplete solutions.
  In addition, we find an explicit complete gradient shrinking soliton on the anti-self-dual bundle of S^4 and CP^2. Both these shrinkers are asymptotic to closed but non-torsion-free G_2 cones. Like the nontrivial AC gradient steady solitons on the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2, these shrinkers appear to be potential singularity models for finite-time singularities of Laplacian flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain, under an additional assumption on the subanalytic abnormal distribution constructed in [4], a proof of the minimal rank Sard conjecture in the analytic category. It establishes that from a given point the set of points accessible through singular horizontal curves of minimal rank, which corresponds to the rank of the distribution, has Lebesgue measure zero. The minimal rank Sard Conjecture is equivalent to the Sard Conjecture for co-rank 1 distributions.</description>

      <title>Genus one singularities in mean curvature flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <title>The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit conjugate points on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family contains the well-known canonical and Euclidean metrics. An upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold in the considered metric is then obtained as the minimum between the length of the geodesic along which the points are conjugate and the length of certain geodesic loops. Numerical experiments support the conjecture that the obtained upper bound is in fact equal to the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Nash-Moser iteration for Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimates of nonlinear equations on complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we employ the Nash-Moser iteration technique to determine a condition under which the positive solution $u$ of the generalized nonlinear Poisson equation $$\operatorname{div} (\varphi(|\nabla u|^2)\nabla u) + \psi(u^2)u = 0,$$ on a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below can be shown to satisfy a Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimate. We define a class of $\varphi$-Laplacian operators by $\Delta_{\varphi}(u):=\operatorname{div} (\varphi(|\nabla u|^2)\nabla u)$, where $\varphi$ is a $C^2$ function under some certain growth conditions. This can be regarded as a natural generalization of the $p$-Laplacian, the $(p,q)$-Laplacian and the exponential Laplacian, as well as having a close connection to the prescribed mean curvature problem. We illustrate the feasibility of applying the Nash-Moser iteration for such Poisson equation to get the Cheng-Yau-type gradient estimates in different cases with various $\varphi$ and $\psi$. Utilizing these estimates, we proves the related Harnack inequalities and a series of Liouville theorems. Our results can cover a wide range of quasilinear Laplace operator (e.g. $p$-Laplacian for $\varphi(t)=t^{p/2-1}$), and Lichnerowicz-type nonlinear equations (i.e. $\psi(t) = At^{p} + Bt^{q} + Ct\log t + D$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a manifold which admits a metric with positive scalar curvature (or a positive intermediate curvature in a suitable sense). We study the moduli space ${\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M\times I)_g$ of concordances of such metrics (with appropriate boundary conditions) which restrict to a given metric $g$ on $M \times \{0\} \cup\partial M \times I$. We show that $\pi_{4*}{\mathscr{M}}^{{\mathsf{pos}}_*}_{\sqcup}(M \times I)_g \otimes {\mathbb Q} \neq 0$ in a stable range provided $\dim M$ is even. We obtain analogous results when positive scalar curvature is replaced by $k$-positive Ricci curvature for $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Resonant forms at zero for dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study resonant differential forms at zero for transitive Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms, $\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a $\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto [\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic $1$-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is $-\chi(M)-1$.</description>

      <title>On CAT($\kappa$) surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces: length metric spaces homeomorphic to a surface having curvature bounded above in the sense of satisfying the $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ condition locally. The main facts about $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces seem to be largely a part of mathematical folklore, and this paper is intended to rectify the situation. We provide three distinct proofs that $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces have bounded (integral) curvature. This fact allows one to apply the established theory of surfaces of bounded curvature to derive further properties of $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces. We also show that $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces can be approximated by smooth Riemannian surfaces of Gaussian curvature at most $\kappa$. We do this by giving explicit formulas for smoothing the vertices of model polyhedral surfaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the solution to a real Monge--Amp\`ere equation on the boundary of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by conjectures in Mirror Symmetry, we continue the study of the real Monge--Amp\`ere operator on the boundary of a simplex. This can be formulated in terms of optimal transport, and we consider, more generally, the problem of optimal transport between symmetric probability measures on the boundary of a simplex and of the dual simplex. For suitably regular measures, we obtain regularity properties of the transport map, and of its convex potential. To do so, we exploit boundary regularity results for optimal transport maps by Caffarelli, together with the symmetries of the simplex.</description>

      <title>Cheeger type inequalities associated with isocapacitary constants on Riemannian manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Steklov eigenvalue of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) with smooth boundary. For compact M , we establish a Cheeger-type inequality for the first Steklov eigenvalue by the isocapacitary constant. For non-compact M , we estimate the bottom of the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator by the isocapacitary constant.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. As a consequence of this correspondence, we show that the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality holds and the $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric provides a characterization of the equality in the inequality on varieties of general type. Additionally, we extend the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality to non-projective normal varieties with a transcendental big and nef cohomology class.</description>
