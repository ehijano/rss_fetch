      <title>Cross-Modal Epileptic Signal Harmonization: Frequency Domain Mapping Quantization for Pre-training a Unified Neurophysiological Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are vital for epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Their unified analysis offers the potential to harness the complementary strengths of each modality but is challenging due to variations in recording montages, amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequency components. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces EpiNT, a novel Transformer-based pre-trained model for unified EEG and iEEG analysis. EpiNT employs channel-independent modeling with masked autoencoders (MAE) and vector quantization (VQ), along with a frequency domain mapping quantizer to capture crucial frequency features. Pre-trained on over 2,700 hours of multi-modal clinical neurophysiological data from 1,199 patients, EpiNT outperformed both randomly initialized models and other pre-trained methods on six downstream classification tasks, demonstrating robust representation learning capabilities. This work presents a promising approach for unified epilepsy neurophysiology analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient and faithful reconstruction of dynamical attractors using homogeneous differentiators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from available measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution. Existing attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological embedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from the actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often available only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and the time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of Homogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more faithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous Differentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their de-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with time-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We apply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of increasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and the Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG recordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain drastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as well as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of magnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the flexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that they can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and reconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both theoretical models and real data.</description>

      <title>Brain-inspired interpretable reservoir computing with resonant recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional artificial neural networks consist of nodes with non-oscillatory dynamics. Biological neural networks, on the other hand, consist of oscillatory components embedded in an oscillatory environment. Motivated by this feature of biological neurons, we describe a reservoir computing framework with explicit damped, oscillatory node dynamics. We express the oscillatory dynamics using two history dependent terms to connect these dynamics with existing artificial neural network approaches and apply physical and stationary constraints to reduce the number of free parameters. We then optimize and illustrate reservoir performance by classifying different brain rhythms associated with epilepsy and show that reservoir elements support classification by resonating with features of the input signals. Applying the same reservoir network to visual and auditory signal types, we show the reservoir generalizes for accurate classification with few trainable parameters. Compared to existing artificial neural network approaches, the proposed resonant reservoir network (RRN) utilizes oscillatory dynamics expressed as a straightforward extension of traditional artificial neural networks, produces interpretable features for classification, avoids computationally expensive training (e.g., backpropagation), and performs well with few parameters in different classification scenarios. We propose that RRNs may serve as efficient, biologically implemented building blocks to achieve complex goals in biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Flow State Dynamics: A Prefrontal Cortex EEG-Based Model Validation Study. Unveiling the Prefrontal Cortex's Role in Flow State Experience: An Empirical EEG Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to explore the optimization of mental performance through the analysis of metrics associated with the psychological state known as flow. Several clinical studies have shown a correlation between the mental state of flow (characterized by deep and relaxed concentration and high psychophysical efficiency) and brain activity measured through electroencephalography (EEG). This study confirms such a correlation, focusing in particular on the sports field, where the flow state tends to occur more frequently. To conduct the study, Sporthype developed proprietary software that integrates several predictive models, in particular the Flow State Index (FSI), implemented within the Holytics system. An analytical protocol was established, including mental exercises and data collection sessions using the portable EEG device Muse, accompanied by a questionnaire to gather athletes' subjective perceptions of their mental state. The results revealed a significant alignment between the EEG data and the subjective experiences reported in the questionnaires, confirming the feasibility of detecting the flow state through prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, the psychological exercises included in the study protocol showed a tangible positive effect in enhancing flow during athletic performance. Flow improves performance through a more harmonious synchronization between mind and body. Although golf was the main context of the experimentation, the mathematical models developed within Holytics were designed to be applicable to a wide range of sports. In addition to golf, preliminary tests have been conducted in other sports such as tennis, as well as in non-sport contexts, including gaming and mental training practices such as mindfulness, concentration, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Anti-seizure medication load is not correlated with early termination of seizure spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy, yet their effect on seizure spread is not fully understood. Higher ASM doses have been associated with shorter and less severe seizures. We aimed to test if this effect was due to limiting seizure spread through early termination of otherwise unchanged seizures.
  Methods: We retrospectively examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings in 15 subjects who underwent ASM tapering during pre-surgical monitoring. We estimated ASM plasma concentrations based on pharmaco-kinetic modeling. In each subject, we identified seizures that followed the same onset and initial spread patterns, but some seizures terminated early (truncated seizures), and other seizures continued to spread (continuing seizures). We first compared seizure duration to ASM concentration for all seizures and the subset of seizures included in truncated-continuing pairs. Then we compared durations of the matched truncated and continuing seizures. Finally, we compared ASM concentrations at the times of truncated seizures and continuing seizures.
  Results: Seizure durations were found to be significantly longer at lower ASM concentrations. Continuing seizures were significantly longer in duration than matched truncated seizures. We found no substantial difference between ASM concentrations when truncated vs. continuing seizures occurred.
  Significance: The lack of difference between ASM concentrations at the time of truncated vs. continuing seizures implies a separate mechanism for shortening the duration of seizures beyond stopping the spread pathways early. Additionally, the mechanism causing seizures to be truncated remains unclear. Further research is needed to understand how ASM may modulate seizure duration and severity.</description>

      <title>Structuring the Environment Nudges Participants Toward Hierarchical Over Shortest Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective planning is crucial for navigating complex environments and achieving goals efficiently. In this study, we investigated how environmental structure influences the selection of planning strategies. Forty-two participants navigated a space station to collect colored spheres, with environments either structured (spheres grouped by color) or unstructured (spheres scattered randomly). We tested three types of plans: hierarchical (grouping spheres by color), shortest path (minimizing travel distance), and neutral (none of the above). By manipulating environmental structure, we were able to nudge participants toward a preference for hierarchical planning in structured environments, while shortest path plans were favored in unstructured environments. A mismatch between self-reported preferences and actual choices indicated that participants often adopted implicit strategies, unaware of their decision-making processes. These findings highlight the powerful effect of environmental cues on planning and suggest that even subtle changes in structure can guide the selection of planning strategies.</description>

      <title>Visual Image Reconstruction from Brain Activity via Latent Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual image reconstruction, the decoding of perceptual content from brain activity into images, has advanced significantly with the integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative models. This review traces the field's evolution from early classification approaches to sophisticated reconstructions that capture detailed, subjective visual experiences, emphasizing the roles of hierarchical latent representations, compositional strategies, and modular architectures. Despite notable progress, challenges remain, such as achieving true zero-shot generalization for unseen images and accurately modeling the complex, subjective aspects of perception. We discuss the need for diverse datasets, refined evaluation metrics aligned with human perceptual judgments, and compositional representations that strengthen model robustness and generalizability. Ethical issues, including privacy, consent, and potential misuse, are underscored as critical considerations for responsible development. Visual image reconstruction offers promising insights into neural coding and enables new psychological measurements of visual experiences, with applications spanning clinical diagnostics and brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>The Memory Paradox: Why Our Brains Need Knowledge in an Age of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory -- systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval, error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological "schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and workforce training in the age of large language models.</description>
