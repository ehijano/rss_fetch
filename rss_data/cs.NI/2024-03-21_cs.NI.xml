      <title>Towards an Edge Intelligence-Based Traffic Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities have undergone significant changes due to the rapid increase in urban population, heightened demand for resources, and growing concerns over climate change. To address these challenges, digital transformation has become a necessity. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensing techniques, such as synthetic sensing, can elevate Digital Twins (DTs) from digital copies of physical objects to effective and efficient platforms for data collection and in-situ processing. In such a scenario, this paper presents a compre-hensive approach for developing a Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) based on Edge Intelligence (EI), specifically designed for smart cities. Our approach prioritizes the placement of intelligence as close as possible to data sources, and leverages an "opportunistic" interpretation of DT (ODT), resulting in a novel and interdisciplinary strategy to re-engineering large-scale distributed smart systems. The preliminary results of the proposed system have shown that moving computation to the edge of the network provides several benefits, including (i) enhanced inference performance, (ii) reduced bandwidth and power consumption, (iii) and decreased latencies with respect to the classic cloud -centric approach.</description>

      <title>UAV-Based Solution for Extending the Lifetime of IoT Devices: Efficiency, Design and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) technology is named as a key ingredient in the evolution towards digitization of many applications and services. A deployment based on battery-powered remote Internet of Things (IoT) devices enables easy installation and operation, yet the autonomy of these devices poses a crucial challenge. A too short lifespan is undesirable from a functional, economical, and ecological point of view. This paper presents a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based approach to recharge remote Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. An in-depth study of the charging efficiency and optimization of key parameters, and measurements-based verification, is reported on. An actual corresponding design and implementation of the full UAV-based charging system and its proof-of-concept validation are presented. Finally, the sustainability of the proposed solution is discussed. The results presented in this paper hence confirm that the proposed UAV-based approach and design are functionally successful and efficient charging can be achieved, provided the constraints and challenges coming with the approach are adequately dealt with. Moreover, it comes with an overall reduction in ecological footprint for IoT applications relying on battery-powered nodes in need of medium energy and/or considerable lifetime expectation (5 years or more).</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Oriented Semantic Communication Framework for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication is an emerging technology that transmits only the relevant semantics of a message instead of the whole message to achieve a specific task. It reduces latency, compresses the data, and is more robust in low SNR scenarios. This work presents a multi-task-oriented semantic communication framework for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). We propose a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) that performs the semantic encoding of the road traffic signs. These encoded images are then transmitted from one CAV to another CAV through satellite in challenging weather conditions where visibility is impaired. In addition, we propose task-oriented semantic decoders for image reconstruction and classification tasks. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms the conventional schemes, such as QAM-16, regarding the reconstructed image's similarity and the classification's accuracy. In addition, it can save up to 89 % of the bandwidth by sending fewer bits.</description>

      <title>5G Networks Supported by UAVs, RESs, and RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the examination of the 5G cellular network aware of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and supported by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles working as mobile access nodes. The investigations have been focused on the energy side of the Radio Access Network (RAN) placed within the area of the city of Poznan (Poland). The gain related to enabling RES generators, i.e., photovoltaic (PV) panels, for base stations (BSs) was presented in the form of two factors -- the average number of UAV replacements (ANUR) with a fully charged one to ensure continuous access to mobile services for currently served user equipment (UE) terminals, and the average reduction in energy consumption (AREC) within the whole network.</description>

      <title>BFT-PoLoc: A Byzantine Fortified Trigonometric Proof of Location Protocol using Internet Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet platforms depend on accurately determining the geographical locations of online users to deliver targeted services (e.g., advertising). The advent of decentralized platforms (blockchains) emphasizes the importance of geographically distributed nodes, making the validation of locations more crucial. In these decentralized settings, mutually non-trusting participants need to {\em prove} their locations to each other. The incentives for claiming desired location include decentralization properties (validators of a blockchain), explicit rewards for improving coverage (physical infrastructure blockchains) and regulatory compliance -- and entice participants towards prevaricating their true location malicious via VPNs, tampering with internet delays, or compromising other parties (challengers) to misrepresent their location. Traditional delay-based geolocation methods focus on reducing the noise in measurements and are very vulnerable to wilful divergences from prescribed protocol.
  In this paper we use Internet delay measurements to securely prove the location of IP addresses while being immune to a large fraction of Byzantine actions. Our core methods are to endow Internet telemetry tools (e.g., ping) with cryptographic primitives (signatures and hash functions) together with Byzantine resistant data inferences subject to Euclidean geometric constraints. We introduce two new networking protocols, robust against Byzantine actions: Proof of Internet Geometry (PoIG) converts delay measurements into precise distance estimates across the Internet; Proof of Location (PoLoc) enables accurate and efficient multilateration of a specific IP address. The key algorithmic innovations are in conducting ``Byzantine fortified trigonometry" (BFT) inferences of data, endowing low rank matrix completion methods with Byzantine resistance.</description>

      <title>Starlink on the Road: A First Look at Mobile Starlink Performance in Central Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks such as Starlink promise to provide world-wide Internet access. While traditionally designed for stationary use, a new dish, released in April 2023 in Europe, provides mobile Internet access including in-motion usage, e.g., while mounted on a car. In this paper, we design and build a mobile measurement setup. Our goal is to fully autonomously conduct continuous Starlink measurements while the car is in motion. We share our practical experiences, including challenges regarding the permanent power supply. We measure the Starlink performance over the span of two months from mid-January to mid-March 2024 when the car is in motion. The measurements consist of all relevant network parameters, such as the download and upload throughput, the RTT, and packet loss, as well as detailed power consumption data. We analyze our dataset to assess Starlink's mobile performance in Central Europe, Germany, and compare it to stationary measurements in proximity. We find that the mobile performance is significantly worse than stationary performance. The power consumption of the new dish is higher, but seems to be more correlated to the heating function of the dish than to the speed of the vehicle.</description>

      <title>Densify &amp; Conquer: Densified, smaller base-stations can conquer the increasing carbon footprint problem in nextG wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector's carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network.</description>

      <title>Network Calculus Bounds for Time-Sensitive Networks: A Revisit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network calculus (NC), particularly its min-plus branch, has been extensively utilized to construct service models and compute delay bounds for time-sensitive networks (TSNs). This paper provides a revisit to the fundamental results. In particular, counterexamples to the most basic min-plus service models, which have been proposed for TSNs and used for computing delay bounds, indicate that the packetization effect has often been overlooked. To address, the max-plus branch of NC is also considered in this paper, whose models handle packetized traffic more explicitly. It is found that mapping the min-plus models to the max-plus models may bring in an immediate improvement over delay bounds derived from the min-plus analysis. In addition, an integrated analytical approach that combines models from both the min-plus and the max-plus NC branches is introduced. In this approach, the max-plus $g$-server model is extended and the extended model, called $g^{x}$-server, is used together with the min-plus arrival curve traffic model. By applying the integrated NC approach, service and delay bounds are derived for several settings that are fundamental in TSNs.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models meet Network Slicing Management and Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network slicing, a cornerstone technology for future networks, enables the creation of customized virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure. This fosters innovation and agility by providing dedicated resources tailored to specific applications. However, current orchestration and management approaches face limitations in handling the complexity of new service demands within multi-administrative domain environments. This paper proposes a future vision for network slicing powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, offering a framework that can be integrated with existing Management and Orchestration (MANO) frameworks. This framework leverages LLMs to translate user intent into technical requirements, map network functions to infrastructure, and manage the entire slice lifecycle, while multi-agent systems facilitate collaboration across different administrative domains. We also discuss the challenges associated with implementing this framework and potential solutions to mitigate them.</description>

      <title>ASOP: A Sovereign and Secure Device Onboarding Protocol for Cloud-based IoT Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing high-friction device onboarding process hinders the promise and potentiality of Internet of Things (IoT). Even after several attempts by various device manufacturers and working groups, no widely adopted standard solution came to fruition. The latest attempt by Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance promises a zero touch solution for mass market IoT customers, but the burden is transferred to the intermediary supply chain (i.e. they have to maintain infrastructure for managing keys and digital signatures called `Ownership Voucher' for all devices). The specification relies on a `Rendezvous Server' mimicking the notion of Domain Name System (DNS) server'. This essentially means resurrecting all existing possible attack scenarios associated with DNS, which include Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and Correlation attack. `Ownership Voucher' poses the risk that some intermediary supply chain agents may act maliciously and reject the transfer of ownership or sign with a wrong key. Furthermore, the deliberate use of the weak elliptic curve SECP256r1/SECP384r1 (also known as NIST P-256/384) in the specification raises questions. We introduce ASOP: a sovereign and secure device onboarding protocol for IoT devices without blindly trusting the device manufacturer, supply chain, and cloud service provider. The ASOP protocol allows onboarding an IoT device to a cloud server with the help of an authenticator owned by the user. This paper outlines the preliminary development of the protocol and its high-level description. Our `zero-trust' and `human-in-the-loop' approach guarantees that the device owner does not remain at the mercy of third-party infrastructures, and it utilises recently standardized post-quantum cryptographic suite (CRYSTALS) to secure connection and messages.</description>

      <title>LogPr\'ecis: Unleashing Language Models for Automated Shell Log Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collection of security-related logs holds the key to understanding attack behaviors and diagnosing vulnerabilities. Still, their analysis remains a daunting challenge. Recently, Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated unmatched potential in understanding natural and programming languages. The question arises whether and how LMs could be also useful for security experts since their logs contain intrinsically confused and obfuscated information. In this paper, we systematically study how to benefit from the state-of-the-art in LM to automatically analyze text-like Unix shell attack logs. We present a thorough design methodology that leads to LogPr\'ecis. It receives as input raw shell sessions and automatically identifies and assigns the attacker tactic to each portion of the session, i.e., unveiling the sequence of the attacker's goals. We demonstrate LogPr\'ecis capability to support the analysis of two large datasets containing about 400,000 unique Unix shell attacks. LogPr\'ecis reduces them into about 3,000 fingerprints, each grouping sessions with the same sequence of tactics. The abstraction it provides lets the analyst better understand attacks, identify fingerprints, detect novelty, link similar attacks, and track families and mutations. Overall, LogPr\'ecis, released as open source, paves the way for better and more responsive defense against cyberattacks.</description>
