      <title>Axiomatizing Rumsfeld Ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry behind duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open sets and compact saturated sets enjoy a perfect formal symmetry, at least for classes of spaces such as Stone spaces or spectral spaces. For larger classes of spaces, a perfect symmetry may not be available, although strong signs of it may remain. These signs appear especially in the classes of spaces involved in Stone-like dualities (such as sober spaces).
  In this article, we introduce a framework with a perfect symmetry between open sets and compact saturated sets, and which includes sober spaces. Our main result is an extension of the duality between sober spaces and spatial frames to a duality between two categories, each equipped with a self-duality. On the spatial side, the self-duality extends de Groot self-duality for stably compact spaces, which swaps open sets with complements of compact saturated sets; this self-duality is made possible using structures reminiscent of bitopological spaces. On the pointfree side, the self-duality is an extension of Lawson self-duality for continuous domains and is achieved via a framework analogous to that of d-frames.
  We show how to derive from our main result the well-known duality between locally compact sober spaces and locally compact frames. In doing so, we provide a presentation of continuous domains in a manner akin to d-frames.</description>

      <title>Computability of Separation Axioms in Countable Second Countable Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effective content of countable, second countable topological spaces by directly calculating the complexity of several topologically defined index sets. We focus on the separation principles, calibrating an arithmetic completeness result for each of the Tychonoff separation axioms. Beyond this, we prove completeness results for various other topological properties, such as being Polish and having a particular Cantor-Bendixson rank, using tools from computable structure theory. This work contrasts with previous work analyzing countable, second countable spaces which used the framework of reverse mathematics, as reverse mathematics generally lacks the precision to pin down exact arithmetic complexity levels for properties of interest.</description>

      <title>Proper and Improper Variants of Mathias and Silver Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we answer several questions in arXiv:2102.06009 regarding density variants of Mathias and Silver forcing. These questions include whether each of the forcing is proper, add dominating real, or add Cohen real. We also generalize one of the proofs to Mathias forcings parametrized by lower semi-continuous submeasures satisfying certain properties.</description>

      <title>On Classical Determinate Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes and studies new classical, type-free theories of truth and determinateness with unprecedented features. The theories are fully compositional, strongly classical (namely, their internal and external logics are both classical), and feature a \emph{defined} determinateness predicate satisfying desirable and widely agreed principles. The theories capture a conception of truth and determinateness according to which the generalizing power associated with the classicality and full compositionality of truth is combined with the identification of a natural class of sentences -- the determinate ones -- for which clear-cut semantic rules are available. Our theories can also be seen as the \emph{classical closures} of Kripke-Feferman truth: their $\omega$-models, which we precisely pinned down, result from including in the extension of the truth predicate the sentences that are satisfied by a Kripkean closed-off fixed point model. The theories compare to recent theories proposed by Fujimoto and Halbach, featuring a primitive determinateness predicate. In the paper we show that our theories entail all principles of Fujimoto and Halbach's theories, and are proof-theoretically equivalent to Fujimoto and Halbach's $\cdplus$. {We also show establish some negative results on Fujimoto and Halbach's theories: such results show that, unlike what happens in our theories, the primitive determinateness predicate prevents one from establishing clear and unrestricted semantic rules for the language with type-free truth.</description>

      <title>On the Isbell problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three models concerning Tukey types of ultrafilters on $\omega$. The first model is built via a countable support iteration, and we show there is no basically generated ultrafilter in such model. The second and third models are built upon different and novel techniques, and in such models all ultrafilters are Tukey top, thus providing an answer to the Isbell problem. In all models there is no $\mathsf{nwd}$-ultrafilter.</description>

      <title>Supersimplicity and arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main motivation for this article is to explore the connections between the existence of certain combinatorial patterns (as in van der Corputs's theorem on arithmetic progressions of length $3$) with well-known tools and theorems for definable groups in simple theories. In the last sections of this article, we apply our model-theoretic results to bound the number of initial points starting few arithmetic progression of length $3$ in the structure of the additive group of integers with a predicate for the prime integers, assuming Dickson's conjecture, or with a predicate for the square-free integers, as well as for asymptotic limits of finite fields. Our techniques yield similar results for the elements appearing as distances in skew-corners and for S\'ark\"ozy's theorem.</description>

      <title>Martin's measurable dilator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Martin's remarkable proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy from an iterable rank-into-rank embedding highlighted the connection between large cardinals and determinacy. In this paper, we isolate a large cardinal object called a measurable dilator from Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy, which captures the structural essence of Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy.</description>
