      <title>Robustness of Incentive Mechanisms Against System Misspecification in Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To steer the behavior of selfish, resource-sharing agents in a socio-technical system towards the direction of higher efficiency, the system designer requires accurate models of both agent behaviors and the underlying system infrastructure. For instance, traffic controllers often use road latency models to design tolls whose deployment can effectively mitigate traffic congestion. However, misspecifications of system parameters may restrict a system designer's ability to influence collective agent behavior toward efficient outcomes. In this work, we study the impact of system misspecifications on toll design for atomic congestion games. We prove that tolls designed under sufficiently minor system misspecifications, when deployed, do not introduce new Nash equilibria in atomic congestion games compared to tolls designed in the noise-free setting, implying a form of local robustness. We then upper bound the degree to which the worst-case equilibrium system performance could decrease when tolls designed under a given level of system misspecification are deployed. We validate our theoretical results via Monte-Carlo simulations as well as realizations of our worst-case guarantees.</description>

      <title>Incentivize Contribution and Learn Parameters Too: Federated Learning with Strategic Data Owners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism with monetary transfers that is budget balanced and enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FeMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees, and better model performance for all agents.</description>

      <title>Multi-Organizational Scheduling: Individual Rationality, Optimality, and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multi-organizational scheduling problems, building upon the framework introduced by Pascual et al.[2009]. In this setting, multiple organizations each own a set of identical machines and sequential jobs with distinct processing times. The challenge lies in optimally assigning jobs across organizations' machines to minimize the overall makespan while ensuring no organization's performance deteriorates. To formalize this fairness constraint, we introduce individual rationality, a game-theoretic concept that guarantees each organization benefits from participation.
  Our analysis reveals that finding an individually rational schedule with minimum makespan is $\Theta_2^{\text{P}}$-hard, placing it in a complexity class strictly harder than both NP and coNP. We further extend the model by considering an alternative objective: minimizing the sum of job completion times, both within individual organizations and across the entire system. The corresponding decision variant proves to be NP-complete. Through comprehensive parameterized complexity analysis of both problems, we provide new insights into these computationally challenging multi-organizational scheduling scenarios.</description>

      <title>Data Sharing with a Generative AI Competitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As GenAI platforms grow, their dependence on content from competing providers, combined with access to alternative data sources, creates new challenges for data-sharing decisions. In this paper, we provide a model of data sharing between a content creation firm and a GenAI platform that can also acquire content from third-party experts. The interaction is modeled as a Stackelberg game: the firm first decides how much of its proprietary dataset to share with GenAI, and GenAI subsequently determines how much additional data to acquire from external experts. Their utilities depend on user traffic, monetary transfers, and the cost of acquiring additional data from external experts. We characterize the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and uncover a surprising phenomenon: The firm may be willing to pay GenAI to share the firm's own data, leading to a costly data-sharing equilibrium. We further characterize the set of Pareto improving data prices, and show that such improvements occur only when the firm pays to share data. Finally, we study how the price can be set to optimize different design objectives, such as promoting firm data sharing, expert data acquisition, or a balance of both. Our results shed light on the economic forces shaping data-sharing partnerships in the age of GenAI, and provide guidance for platforms, regulators and policymakers seeking to design effective data exchange mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Finding Possible Winners in Spatial Voting with Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spatial voting model where both candidates and voters are positioned in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, and each voter ranks candidates based on their proximity to the voter's ideal point. We focus on the scenario where the given information about the locations of the voters' ideal points is incomplete; for each dimension, only an interval of possible values is known. In this context, we investigate the computational complexity of determining the possible winners under positional scoring rules. Our results show that the possible winner problem in one dimension is solvable in polynomial time for all $k$-truncated voting rules with constant $k$. Moreover, for some scoring rules for which the possible winner problem is NP-complete, such as approval voting for any dimension or $k$-approval for $d \geq 2$ dimensions, we give an FPT algorithm parameterized by the number of candidates. Finally, we classify tractable and intractable settings of the weighted possible winner problem in one dimension, and resolve the computational complexity of the weighted case for all two-valued positional scoring rules when $d=1$.</description>

      <title>The Hamiltonian of Poly-matrix Zero-sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</description>

      <title>More Efforts Towards Fixed-Parameter Approximability of Multiwinner Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiwinner Elections have emerged as a prominent area of research with numerous practical applications. We contribute to this area by designing parameterized approximation algorithms and also resolving an open question by Yang and Wang [AAMAS'18]. More formally, given a set of candidates, \mathcal{C}, a set of voters,\mathcal{V}, approving a subset of candidates (called approval set of a voter), and an integer $k$, we consider the problem of selecting a ``good'' committee using Thiele rules. This problem is computationally challenging for most Thiele rules with monotone submodular satisfaction functions, as there is no (1-\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon)\footnote{Here, $e$ denotes the base of the natural logarithm.}-approximation algorithm in f(k)(|\mathcal{C}| + |\mathcal{V}|)^{o(k)} time for any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and any computable function $f$, and no {\sf PTAS} even when the length of approval set is two. Skowron [WINE'16] designed an approximation scheme running in FPT time parameterized by the combined parameter, size of the approval set and $k$. In this paper, we consider a parameter $d+k$ (no $d$ voters approve the same set of $d$ candidates), where $d$ is upper bounded by the size of the approval set (thus, can be much smaller).
  With respect to this parameter, we design parameterized approximation schemes, a lossy polynomial-time preprocessing method, and show that an extra committee member suffices to achieve the desired score (i.e., $1$-additive approximation). Additionally, we resolve an open question by Yang and Wang~[AAMAS'18] regarding the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem under the PAV rule with the total score as the parameter, demonstrating that it admits an FPT algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Ratio for Strategyproof Facility Location on a Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of design of strategyproof in expectation (SP) mechanisms for facility location on a cycle, with the objective of minimizing the sum of costs of $n$ agents. We show that there exists an SP mechanism that attains an approximation ratio of $7/4$ with respect to the sum of costs of the agents, thus improving the best known upper bound of $2-2/n$ in the cases of $n \geq 5$. The mechanism obtaining the bound randomizes between two mechanisms known in the literature: the Random Dictator (RD) and the Proportional Circle Distance (PCD) mechanism of Meir (arXiv:1902.08070). To prove the result, we propose a cycle-cutting technique that allows for estimating the problem on a cycle by a problem on a line.</description>

      <title>Computing the Schulze Method for Large-Scale Preference Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schulze method is a voting rule widely used in practice and enjoys many positive axiomatic properties. While it is computable in polynomial time, its straight-forward implementation does not scale well for large elections. In this paper, we develop a highly optimised algorithm for computing the Schulze method with Pregel, a framework for massively parallel computation of graph problems, and demonstrate its applicability for large preference data sets. In addition, our theoretic analysis shows that the Schulze method is indeed particularly well-suited for parallel computation, in stark contrast to the related ranked pairs method. More precisely we show that winner determination subject to the Schulze method is NL-complete, whereas this problem is P-complete for the ranked pairs method.</description>

      <title>Meta-rotations and the Structure of Stable Matchings in the Student Project Allocation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formally introduce and present the concept of meta-rotations as a tool for navigating the lattice of stable matchings in the Student Project Allocation problem with lecturer preferences over students (SPA-S). Building on the structural result that the set of stable matchings in any SPA-S instance forms a distributive lattice, we define meta-rotations for this setting and demonstrate how they compactly encode transitions between matchings. Our framework generalises the classical notion of rotations in bipartite settings and provides a systematic way to traverse the lattice, thereby enabling efficient enumeration of the set of stable matchings in any given SPA-S instance.</description>

      <title>Bi-Level Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO) problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients (BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and leverages the Nystr\"om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability, assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of discrete and continuous control tasks.</description>

      <title>Achieving PAC Guarantees in Mechanism Design through Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically derive a class of optimal solutions to a linear program (LP) for automated mechanism design that satisfies efficiency, incentive compatibility, strong budget balance (SBB), and individual rationality (IR), where SBB and IR are enforced in expectation. These solutions can be expressed using a set of essential variables whose cardinality is exponentially smaller than the total number of variables in the original formulation. However, evaluating a key term in the solutions requires exponentially many optimization steps as the number of players $N$ increases. We address this by translating the evaluation of this term into a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and develop a probably approximately correct (PAC) estimator with asymptotically optimal sample complexity. This MAB-based approach reduces the optimization complexity from exponential to $O(N\log N)$. Numerical experiments confirm that our method efficiently computes mechanisms with the target properties, scaling to problems with up to $N=128$ players -- substantially improving over prior work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the self-interest level of Markov social dilemmas. We extend the concept of self-interest level from normal-form games to Markov games, providing a quantitative measure of the minimum reward exchange required to align individual and collective interests. We demonstrate our method on three environments from the Melting Pot suite, representing either common-pool resources or public goods. Our results illustrate how reward exchange can enable agents to transition from selfish to collective equilibria in a Markov social dilemma. This work contributes to multi-agent reinforcement learning by providing a practical tool for analysing complex, multistep social dilemmas. Our findings offer insights into how reward structures can promote or hinder cooperation, with potential applications in areas such as mechanism design.</description>

      <title>The Panel Complexity of Sortition: Is 12 Angry Men Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sortition is the practice of delegating public decision-making to randomly selected panels. Recently, it has gained momentum worldwide through its use in citizens' assemblies, sparking growing interest within the computer science community. One key appeal of sortition is that random panels tend to be more representative of the population than elected committees or parliaments. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel definition of representative panels, based on the Wasserstein distance from statistical learning theory. Using this definition, we develop a framework for analyzing the panel complexity problem -- determining the required panel size to ensure desirable properties. We focus on three key desiderata: (1) that efficiency at the panel level extends to the whole population, measured by social welfare; (2) that fairness guarantees for the panel translate to fairness for the population, captured by the core; and (3) that the probability of an outlier panel, for which the decision significantly deviates from the optimal one, remains low. We establish near-tight panel complexity guarantees for these desiderata across two fundamental social choice settings: participatory budgeting and facility location.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>The ICML 2023 Ranking Experiment: Examining Author Self-Assessment in ML/AI Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conducted an experiment during the review process of the 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), asking authors with multiple submissions to rank their papers based on perceived quality. In total, we received 1,342 rankings, each from a different author, covering 2,592 submissions. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how author-provided rankings could be leveraged to improve peer review processes at machine learning conferences. We focus on the Isotonic Mechanism, which calibrates raw review scores using the author-provided rankings. Our analysis shows that these ranking-calibrated scores outperform the raw review scores in estimating the ground truth ``expected review scores'' in terms of both squared and absolute error metrics. Furthermore, we propose several cautious, low-risk applications of the Isotonic Mechanism and author-provided rankings in peer review, including supporting senior area chairs in overseeing area chairs' recommendations, assisting in the selection of paper awards, and guiding the recruitment of emergency reviewers.</description>

      <title>Decoding Game: On Minimax Optimality of Heuristic Text Generation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding strategies play a pivotal role in text generation for modern language models, yet a puzzling gap divides theory and practice. Surprisingly, strategies that should intuitively be optimal, such as Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), often perform poorly in practice. Meanwhile, popular heuristic approaches like Top-$k$ and Nucleus sampling, which employ truncation and normalization of the conditional next-token probabilities, have achieved great empirical success but lack theoretical justifications. In this paper, we propose Decoding Game, a comprehensive theoretical framework which reimagines text generation as a two-player zero-sum game between Strategist, who seeks to produce text credible in the true distribution, and Nature, who distorts the true distribution adversarially. After discussing the decomposibility of multi-step generation, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form for one-step Decoding Game. It is shown that the adversarial Nature imposes an implicit regularization on likelihood maximization, and truncation-normalization methods are first-order approximations to the optimal strategy under this regularization. Additionally, by generalizing the objective and parameters of Decoding Game, near-optimal strategies encompass diverse methods such as greedy search, temperature scaling, and hybrids thereof. Numerical experiments are conducted to complement our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-alternating mean payoff games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and study a variant of the mean payoff games introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht and J. Mycielski. In this version, the second player makes an infinite sequence of moves only after the first player's sequence of moves has been decided and revealed. Such games occur in the computation of the covering radius of constrained systems, a quantity of interest in coding theory.</description>
