      <title>Most Likely Noise-Induced Overturning Circulation Collapse in a 2D Boussinesq Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a reasonable possibility that the present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is in a bi-stable regime and hence it is relevant to compute probabilities and pathways of noise-induced transitions between the stable equilibrium states. Here, the most probable transition pathway of a noise-induced collapse of the northern overturning circulation in a spatially-continuous two-dimensional model with surface temperature and stochastic salinity forcings is directly computed using Large Deviation Theory (LDT). This pathway reveals the fluid dynamical mechanisms of such a collapse. Paradoxically it starts off with a strengthening of the northern overturning circulation before a short but strong salinity pulse induces a second overturning cell. The increased atmospheric energy input of this two-cell configuration cannot be mixed away quickly enough, leading to the collapse of the northern overturning cell and finally resulting in a southern overturning circulation. Additionally, the approach allows us to compare the probability of this collapse under different parameters in the deterministic part of the salinity surface forcing, which quantifies the increase in collapse probability as the bifurcation point of the system is approached.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transition Paths for AMOC Collapse and Recovery in a Stochastic Box Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong evidence that the present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is in a bi-stable regime and hence it is important to determine probabilities and pathways for noise-induced transitions between its equilibrium states. Here, using Large Deviation Theory (LDT), the most probable transition pathways for the noise-induced collapse and recovery of the AMOC are computed in a stochastic box model of the World Ocean. This allows us to determine the physical mechanisms of noise-induced AMOC transitions. We show that the most likely path of an AMOC collapse starts paradoxically with a strengthening of the AMOC followed by an immediate drop within a couple of years due to a short but relatively strong freshwater pulse. The recovery on the other hand is a slow process, where the North Atlantic needs to be gradually salinified over a course of 20 years. The proposed method provides several benefits, including an estimate of probability ratios of collapse between various freshwater noise scenarios, showing that the AMOC is most vulnerable to freshwater forcing into the Atlantic thermocline region. Moreover, a comparison with a quasi-equilibrium approach reveals the contrasts in behavior of a bifurcation-induced and a noise-induced collapse of the AMOC.</description>

      <title>A non-autonomous framework for climate change and extreme weather events increase in a stochastic energy balance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a three-timescale framework for modelling climate change and introduce a space-heterogeneous one-dimensional energy balance model. This model, addressing temperature fluctuations from rising carbon dioxide levels and the super-greenhouse effect in tropical regions, fits within the setting of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Our results show how both mean and variance of temperature increase, without the system going through a bifurcation point. This study aims to advance the conceptual understanding of the extreme weather events frequency increase due to climate change.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of Kelvin waves by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the zonal mean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equatorial Kelvin waves can be affected by subtropical Rossby wave dynamics. Previous research has demonstrated the Kelvin wave growth in response to subtropical forcing and the resonant growth due to eddy momentum flux convergence. However, the relative importance of the wave-mean flow and wave-wave interactions for the Kelvin wave growth compared to the direct wave excitation by the external forcing has not been made clear. This study demonstrates the resonant Kelvin wave excitation by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the mean flow using a spherical shallow-water model. The use of Hough harmonics as basis functions makes Rossby and Kelvin waves prognostic variables of the model and allows the quantification of terms contributing to their tendencies in physical and wave space. The simulations show that Kelvin waves are resonantly excited by interactions of Rossby waves and the balanced zonal mean flow in the subtropics, provided the Rossby and Kelvin wave frequencies, which are modified by the mean flow, match. The resonance mechanism is substantiated by analytical expressions. The Kelvin wave tendencies are caused by velocity and depth tendencies: The velocity tendencies due to the meridional advection of zonal mean velocity can be outweighed by the zonal advection of Rossby wave velocity or by the depth tendencies due to Rossby wave divergence. Identifying the resonant excitation mechanism in data should contribute to the quantification of Kelvin wave variability originating in the subtropics.</description>
