      <title>Modeling Headway in Heterogeneous and Mixed Traffic Flow: A Statistical Distribution Based on a General Exponential Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of existing headway distributions to accurately reflect the diverse behaviors and characteristics in heterogeneous traffic (different types of vehicles) and mixed traffic (human-driven vehicles with autonomous vehicles) is limited, leading to unsatisfactory goodness of fit. To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.</description>

      <title>Post-2024 U.S. Presidential Election Analysis of Election and Poll Data: Real-life Validation of Prediction via Small Area Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a post-election analysis of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election (USPE) using a prediction model derived from the Small Area Estimation (SAE) methodology. With pollster data obtained one week prior to the election day, retrospectively, our SAE-based prediction model can perfectly predict the Electoral College election results in all 44 states where polling data were available. In addition to such desirable prediction accuracy, we introduce the probability of incorrect prediction (PoIP) to rigorously analyze prediction uncertainty. Since the standard bootstrap method appears inadequate for estimating PoIP, we propose a conformal inference method that yields reliable uncertainty quantification. We further investigate potential pollster biases by the means of sensitivity analyses and conclude that swing states are particularly vulnerable to polling bias in the prediction of the 2024 USPE.</description>

      <title>Adjusting for Heavy Censoring and Double-Dipping to Compare Risk Stratification Abilities of Existing Models for Time to Diagnosis of Huntington Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huntington disease (HD) is a genetically inherited neurodegenerative disease with progressively worsening symptoms. Accurately modeling time to HD diagnosis is essential for clinical trial design and treatment planning. Langbehn's model, the CAG-Age Product (CAP) model, the Prognostic Index Normed (PIN) model, and the Multivariate Risk Score (MRS) model have all been proposed for this task. However, differing in methodology, assumptions, and accuracy, these models may yield conflicting predictions. Few studies have systematically compared these models' performance, and those that have could be misleading due to (i) testing the models on the same data used to train them and (ii) failing to account for high rates of right censoring (80%+) in performance metrics. We discuss the theoretical foundations of the four most common models of time to HD diagnosis, offering intuitive comparisons about their practical feasibility. Further, we externally validate their risk stratification abilities using data from the ENROLL-HD study and performance metrics that adjust for censoring. Our findings guide the selection of a model for HD clinical trial design. The MRS model, which incorporates the most covariates, performed the best. However, the simpler CAP and PIN models were not far behind and may be logistically simpler to adopt. We also show how these models can be used to estimate sample sizes for an HD clinical trial, emphasizing that previous estimates would lead to underpowered trials.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Power Systems Resilience Using Statistical Analysis and Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is significantly affecting the power grid, causing large-scale outages and impacting power system resilience. Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region's resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast SDE-based Monte Carlo dose calculation for proton therapy validated against Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To validate a newly proposed stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based model for proton beam energy deposition by comparing its predictions with those from Geant4 in simplified phantom scenarios. Approach: Building on previous work in Crossley et al. (2025), where energy deposition from a proton beam was modelled using an SDE framework, we implemented the model with standard approximations to interaction cross sections and mean excitation energies, which makes simulations easily adaptable to new materials and configurations. The model was benchmarked against Geant4 in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. Main results: The SDE-based dose distributions agreed well with Geant4, showing range differences within 0.4 mm and 3D gamma pass rates exceeding 98% under 3%/2 mm criteria with a 1% dose threshold. The model achieved a computational speed-up of approximately fivefold relative to Geant4, consistent across different Geant4 physics lists. Significance: These results demonstrate that the SDE approach can reproduce accuracy comparable to high-fidelity Monte Carlo for proton therapy at a fraction of the computational cost, highlighting its potential for accelerating dose calculations and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Approach to Pose Synchronization for Multi-Reference Alignment with Applications to MIMO Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency. Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Shotgun DNA sequencing evidence: sample-specific and unknown genotyping error probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many forensic genetic trace samples are of too low quality to obtain short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiles as the nuclear DNA they contain is highly degraded (e.g., telogen hairs). Instead, performing shotgun DNA sequencing of such samples can provide valuable information on, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. As a result, shotgun sequencing is starting to gain more attention in forensic genetics and statistical models to correctly interpret such evidence, including properly accounting for sequencing errors, are needed. One such model is the wgsLR model by Andersen et. al. (2025) that enabled evaluating the evidential strength of a comparison between the genotypes in the trace sample and reference sample assuming a single-source contribution to both samples. This paper extends the wgsLR model to allow for different (asymmetric) genotyping error probabilities (e.g., from a low quality trace sample and a high quality reference sample). The model was also extended to handle unknown genotyping error probabilities via both maximising profile likelihood and using a prior distribution. The sensitivity of the wgsLR model against overdispersion was also investigated and it was found robust against it. It was also found that handling an unknown genotyping error probability of the trace sample with the methods having a sufficient number of independent markers gave concordant weight of evidence (WoE) under both the hypotheses (same or different individuals being donors of trace and reference sample). It was found more conservative to use a too small trace sample genotyping error probability rather than a too high genotyping error probability as the latter can explain genotype inconsistencies by errors rather than due to two different individuals being the donors of the trace sample and reference sample. The extensions of the model are implemented in the R package wgsLR.</description>

      <title>Bias correction of satellite and reanalysis products for daily rainfall occurrence and intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Study region: Ghana and Zambia, Africa
  Study focus: This study rigorously evaluates a suite of bias correction (BC) methods, including statistical approaches (LOCI, QM), machine learning (SVR, GPR), and hybrid techniques (LOCI-GPR, QM-GPR), applied to seven satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) across 38 stations in Ghana and Zambia, aiming to assess their performance in rainfall detection and intensity estimation.
  New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicate that the ENACTS product, which uniquely integrates a large number of station records, was the most corrigible SRE; in Zambia, nearly all BC methods successfully reduced the mean error in daily rainfall amounts at over 70\% of stations. However, this performance requires further validation at independent stations not incorporated into the ENACTS product. Overall, statistical methods (QM and LOCI) generally outperformed other techniques, although QM exhibited a tendency to inflate rainfall values. All SREs corrected with the statistical and hybrid BC methods demonstrated high capability for detecting dry days (POD $\ge$ 0.80). A critical limitation persisted, however, as all SREs (except ENACTS), after correction with BC methods, consistently failed to improve the detection of heavy and violent rainfall events (POD $\leq$ 0.2), highlighting a crucial area for future research.</description>

      <title>Multivariate ordered discrete response models with two layers of dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of multivariate ordered discrete response models featuring general rectangular structures, which allow for functionally interdependent thresholds across dimensions, extending beyond traditional (lattice) models that assume threshold independence. The new models incorporate two layers of dependence: one arising from the interdependence of decision rules (capturing broad bracketing behaviors) and another from the correlation of latent utilities conditional on observables. We provide microfoundations, explore semiparametric and parametric specifications, and establish identification conditions under logical consistency in decision-making. An empirical application to health insurance markets demonstrates the advantages of this new framework, showing how it disentangles moral hazard (captured via threshold dependence) from adverse selection (isolated in unobservable correlations), offering insights into behavioral responses obscured by lattice models.</description>

      <title>Social feedback amplifies emotional language in online video live chats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing share of human interactions now occurs online, where the expression and perception of emotions are often amplified and distorted. Yet, the interplay between different emotions and the extent to which they are driven by external stimuli or social feedback remains poorly understood. We calibrate a multivariate Hawkes self-exciting point process to model the temporal expression of six basic emotions in YouTube Live chats. This framework captures both temporal and cross-emotional dependencies while allowing us to disentangle the influence of video content (exogenous) from peer interactions (endogenous). We find that emotional expressions are up to four times more strongly driven by peer interaction than by video content. Positivity is more contagious, spreading three times more readily, whereas negativity is more memorable, lingering nearly twice as long. Moreover, we observe asymmetric cross-excitation, with negative emotions frequently triggering positive ones, a pattern consistent with trolling dynamics, but not the reverse. These findings highlight the central role of social interaction in shaping emotional dynamics online and the risks of emotional manipulation as human-chatbot interactions become increasingly realistic.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>
