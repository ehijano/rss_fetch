      <title>Dynamics of Unemployment with Discouraged Workers: A Nonlinear Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we formulate and analyze a new non-linear mathematical model to describe the dynamics of unemployment with a discouraged working population. We consider five dynamic variables, namely, unskilled unemployed individuals, skilled unemployed individuals, discouraged individuals, employed persons, and job vacancies. Furthermore, we determine the equilibrium points of the dynamic system and investigate their local stability. To demonstrate the results, we conduct numerical simulations by presenting solution trajectories and analyzing how variations in key parameters influence the states of the dynamical variables.</description>

      <title>Managing Situations of Complexity and Uncertainty : The Contribution of Research and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second industrial revolution saw the development of management methods tailored to the challenges of the times: firstly, the need for mass production, and then, the pursuit of improved quality and customer satisfaction, followed by a push to improve operational performances in response to market globalization. If these approaches were initially inspired by rational mechanistic thinking, they have since gradually broadened to integrate other dimensions such as psychology, sociology and systemic analysis. Business enterprises underwent a profound rethink in the 1990s introducing increasingly refined modi operandi, only to find their environment disrupted by the appearance of two new parameters: complexity and uncertainty. Enterprises of the third industrial revolution were able to integrate these parameters at the outset, introducing new styles of management. However, these may well be deficient with regard to activities where an error may be fatal, or a failure intolerable. Caught between the precautionary principle and the principle of experimentation, the third industrial revolution falters to find the right approach, whereas the fourth industrial revolution is almost already upon us, bringing its lot of upheavals. In this regard, faced with increasing complexities and uncertainties, Research and Development is of particular interest since its vocation consists precisely in confronting the complex and the uncertain. This article examines the fundamental principles of the R&amp;D process, and analyses how these may act as a benchmark for contemporary management by providing sources of inspiration.</description>

      <title>Reliability is a new science: we are on the right way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability has long been treated as an engineering practice supported by testing, statistics and standards, yet its status as a scientific discipline remains unsettled. From a philosophical perspective, scientific truth is characterized by a dual-structure that links empirical truth and mathematical truth, which requires an axiomatic system that is symbolically expressible and verifiable by universally repeatable controlled experiments. Building on this criterion, this paper examines whether reliability satisfies the dual-structure of scientific truth. Firstly, we analyze the philosophical foundations of the reliability problem, tracing its transition from experiential confidence and engineering practice toward scientific inquiry. Then, reliability science principles are introduced as an axiomatic system consisting of margin, degradation and uncertainty, which define reliability as the repeatability of system performance across time and space. Next, we present reliability science experiments as the empirical aspect of the dual-structure, where controlled and repeatable interventions are designed to verify the causal relations implied by the axioms. Furthermore, we develop the mathematical framework of reliability as the symbolic aspect of the dual-structure, articulating reliability laws through distance, relation and change, and developing a time-dependent measure, Biandong Statistics, to represent varying uncertainty beyond static descriptions. Accordingly, we argue that reliability is indeed a scientific discipline. The applicability of reliability science is demonstrated across engineering, living and social systems, and a unified logic for guiding engineering activities across the entire product lifecycle is provided, linking reliability to the conceptual, development, procurement, production and operation phases within a model-based structure.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can persistent functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling persistent and discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce structural and functional persistence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and persist, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Bystander effect emerges from individual psychological prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to help a person potentially in need if there are others present. Sociologists and psychologists have proposed multiple plausible reasons for the bystander effect, from situational ambiguity and social contagion to diffusion of responsibility and mutual denial. We build a new model of an individual's decision to intervene in a bystander situation based on these social psychological hypotheses, along with ideas borrowed from prospect theory. This model shows, for the first time, that the bystander effect emerges from social risk perception among non-coordinating individuals in ambiguous bystander situations. Expanding upon this static model, we explore the effect of social learning, where individuals update their perceived risk of intervening after experiencing or witnessing the social repercussions of previous interventions. A novel result of this model is that social learning exacerbates the bystander effect. We validate these models using a new database of 42 experimental and observational studies across a wide range of bystander situations, demonstrating a straightforward and generalizable explanation for the observed phenomenon, which may suggest effective interventions tailored to specific bystander situations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking, Hysteresis, and Convergence to the Mean Voter in two-party Spatial Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Learning in Stochastic Games: from Multistability and Chaos to Stable Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust coordination and cooperation is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Uncovering the mechanisms underlying such emergent behaviors calls for a dynamical understanding of learn processes. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of actor-critic agents in stochastic games, focusing on the impact of entropy regularization. By leveraging time-scale separation, we derive the system's evolution equations, which are then formally analyzed using dynamical systems theory. We find that in the constant-sum game of Matching Pennies, the system exhibits chaotic behavior. Entropy regularization mitigates this chaos and drives the dynamics toward convergence to fair cooperation. In contrast, in the general-sum game of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the system displays multistability. Interestingly, the three stable equilibria of the system correspond to the well-known ALLC (Always Cooperate), ALLD (Always Defect), and GRIM (Grim Trigger) strategies from evolutionary game theory (EGT). Entropy regularization strengthens system resilience by enlarging the basin of attraction of the cooperative equilibrium. Our findings reveal a close link between the mechanism of direct reciprocity in EGT and how cooperation emerges in MARL, offering insights for designing more robust and collaborative multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Extending the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model with nonconformists and inflexibles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally, the Biswas--Chatterjee--Sen model exhibits an order/disorder phase transition for a sufficiently large number of negative interactions among actors. In this paper, the model is extended by the nonconformists and inflexibles. Nonconformists are actors who do not follow the original model rules, but in different ways do something opposite. We introduce inflexibles as actors who does not change their opinions. Both discrete and continuous opinions are considered. With direct Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations, we check the influence of fractions of nonconformists and inflexibles on mean opinion in the system. With the mean-field calculations we identify ranges of fractions of nonconformists where ordered phase of the system is available. The results of the mean-field calculations perfectly match the results of the Monte Carlo simulations. We consider inflexibles adhered: (i) to extreme opinions; (ii) to specific opinions and (iii) chosen independently of their initial opinion. For inflexibles adhered to specific and extreme opinions they play a role of effective bias suppressing disorder phase in the system. The qualitative results of introducing nonconformists (inflexibles) in various ways (discrete/continuous opinions and annealed/quenched disorder) are roughly the same. However, for the model extended by inflexibles, we can observe a systematic shift of the mean order parameter to its higher values for quenched disorder compared with annealed disorder.</description>

      <title>A note on thermodynamics of the production processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of creating goods and services, measured by their value, is considered as a process of creating complexity. This makes it possible to consider the production system as an open thermodynamic system, and to develop a simple heuristic model for the production process. The model includes three production factors: the index of complexity of production equipment (physical capital $K$), human activity (labour $L$), and the substitutive capacity of equipment (substitutive work $P$). The latter is a contribution to economic theory from the thermodynamic approach, which also requires the introduction of technological characteristics of production equipment, such as labor requirement ($\overline{\lambda}$) and energy requirement ($\overline{\varepsilon}$), which indicate the amounts of labor and energy required to operate production equipment. By applying thermodynamic principles to the theory of production, we can understand how labour can be replaced by capital, and derive the production function in four equivalent but different formulations. Two of them are known and used by economists for interpretation the production phenomena; the thermodynamic approach gives some foundation for economic theory. The production function allows an unambiguously decompose of the growth rate of output according to the growth rates of production factors and technological level. The introduction of substitute work as a factor of production and technological features of capital expands planning and analyse of production processes.</description>

      <title>Mind the Temperature Gap: The Role of Pit Thermal Energy Storage in a Sector-Coupled Energy System with High-Temperature District Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pit thermal energy storage (PTES) provides large-scale thermal storage capacity in district heating systems, supporting flexibility on both daily and seasonal scales. Most existing large-scale energy system studies on PTES do not account for temperature differences between storage and the network. Neglecting these temperature differences can result in less efficient PTES integration, since they affect usable energy capacity and introduce additional costs for discharge requiring temperature boosting. To explore how temperature constraints shape the system-level value of PTES, we use PyPSA-DE, an open-source sector-coupled capacity expansion model of Germany and neighboring countries in a scenario with net zero carbon emissions for 2045. To isolate PTES effects, we examine counterfactual scenarios: systems without PTES, idealized systems with PTES but without temperature constraints, and feasible systems with boosting. We find that PTES reduces German annual system costs by 135-345 M EUR per year relative to systems relying solely on tank storage. Lowering maximum forward temperatures from 124 degrees C to 95 degrees C decreases district heating costs by 7.6 percent without PTES and 10 percent with PTES. Idealized scenarios without temperature constraints yield district heating cost savings of up to 15 percent, indicating that temperature-agnostic modeling overestimates PTES benefits. PTES provides economic value even under current high temperatures, though temperature misalignment limits its contribution during peak demand due to the need for boosting. The findings highlight the role of PTES in leveraging low-price electricity through electrified heating while emphasizing the importance of explicitly accounting for temperature constraints.</description>

      <title>Setting up the physical principles of resilience in a model of the Earth System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet's temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of Euler characteristic of finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review outlines the major approaches to modelling opinion formation and manipulation in mathematics and computer science. Key tools such as ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic models, control theory, and interaction protocols are introduced and compared as methods for describing manipulation. The review is separated into those models using a continuous opinion space and those using discrete or binary opinions, with the advantages and disadvantages of each discussed. Finally, the authors provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the field of opinion dynamics and its social significance.</description>

      <title>A Review of Urban Resilience Frameworks: Transferring Knowledge to Enhance Pandemic Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17371</link>

Abstract: Urbanization is rapidly increasing, with urban populations expected to grow significantly by 2050, particularly in developing regions. This expansion brings challenges related to chronic stresses and acute shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the critical role of urban form in a city's capacity to manage public health crises. Despite the heightened interest in urban resilience, research examining the relationship between urban morphology and pandemic resilience remains limited, often focusing solely on density and its effect on disease transmission. This work aims to address this gap by evaluating existing frameworks that analyze the relationship between urban resilience and urban form. By critically reviewing these frameworks, with a particular emphasis on theoretical and quantitative approaches, this study seeks to transfer the knowledge gained to better understand the relationship between pandemic resilience and urban morphology. The work also links theoretical ideas with quantitative frameworks, offering a cohesive analysis. The anticipated novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive assessment of urban resilience frameworks and the identification of the current gaps in integrating resilience to pandemic thinking into urban planning and design. The goal is not only to enhance the understanding of urban resilience but also to offer practical guidance for developing more adaptive and effective frameworks for assessing resilience to pandemics in urban environments, thereby preparing cities to better withstand and recover from future crises.</description>

      <title>Suppressing secondary shock waves in jam-absorption driving via string-stable support vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a freeway-driving strategy, jam-absorption driving (JAD) clears a traffic shock wave (stop-and-go wave) by slowing down a single vehicle, called the absorbing vehicle. However, JAD may destabilize the traffic flow upstream of this vehicle, generating secondary shock waves. This study proposes a method to suppress secondary shock waves by controlling the behavior of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) upstream of the absorbing vehicle, called support vehicles (SVs). A string-stability-based control method is applied in which SVs dynamically extend their time gaps to provide support driving (SD) for JAD. Numerical simulations revealed that SD damped perturbations caused by the absorbing vehicle and prevented secondary shock waves, consistent with the head-to-tail string stability criterion. Combining JAD and SD reduced fuel consumption and collision risk compared with the JAD-only method, but increased travel time. Reverting the extended time gap to its initial value reduced travel time while maintaining low collision risk compared with the non-reverting method, albeit with increased fuel consumption. Thus, combining JAD and SD effectively eliminates the target shock wave while suppressing secondary shock waves with guaranteed string stability.</description>

      <title>Homophily and wealth inequality shape mitigation behavior in coupled social-climate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role of human behavior in shaping environmental outcomes is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change. Environmental systems are influenced not only by natural factors like temperature, but also by human decisions regarding mitigation efforts, which are often based on forecasts or predictions about future environmental conditions. Over time, different outcomes can emerge, including scenarios where the environment deteriorates despite efforts to mitigate, or where successful mitigation leads to environmental resilience. Additionally, fluctuations in the level of human participation in mitigation can occur, reflecting shifts in collective behavior. In this study, we consider a variety of human mitigation decisions, in addition to the feedback loop that is created by changes in human behavior because of environmental changes. While these outcomes are based on simplified models, they offer important insights into the dynamics of human decision-making and the factors that influence effective action in the context of environmental sustainability. This study aims to examine key social dynamics influencing society's response to a worsening climate. While others conclude that homophily prompts greater warming unconditionally, this model finds that homophily can prevent catastrophic effects given a poor initial environmental state. Assuming that poor countries have the resources to do so, a consensus in that class group to defect from the strategy of the rich group (who are generally incentivized to continue ``business as usual'') can frequently prevent the vegetation proportion from converging to 0.</description>

      <title>Multilayer network science: theory, methods, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer network science has emerged as a central framework for analysing interconnected and interdependent complex systems. Its relevance has grown substantially with the increasing availability of rich, heterogeneous data, which makes it possible to uncover and exploit the inherently multilayered organisation of many real-world networks. In this review, we summarise recent developments in the field. On the theoretical and methodological front, we outline core concepts and survey advances in community detection, dynamical processes, temporal networks, higher-order interactions, and machine-learning-based approaches. On the application side, we discuss progress across diverse domains, including interdependent infrastructures, spreading dynamics, computational social science, economic and financial systems, ecological and climate networks, science-of-science studies, network medicine, and network neuroscience. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, emphasizing the need for standardized datasets and software, deeper integration of temporal and higher-order structures, and a transition toward genuinely predictive models of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Relations Among Different Inequality Measures in Complex Systems: From Kinetic Exchange to Earthquake Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of several inequality measures across two kinetic wealth-exchange models with extreme inequality features (namely the Banerjee model, and the Chakraborti or Yard-Sale model) and two earthquake simulating models (namely the Chakrabarti-Stinchcombe two-fractal overlap model and the nonlinear dynamical Burridge-Knopoff model). For each model we compute numerically the Lorenz function for the respective models' wealth, overlap magnitude or avalanche distributions. We then estimate the variations of Gini (g), Pietra (p) and Kolkata (k) indices in these models with systematic variations of saving propensity (for the two wealth-exchange models), with systematic variations of generation or block numbers (for the two earthquake simulating models). We find, the values of p/(2k-1) (across the wealth exchange models and the two-fractal overlap model) remain a little above unity (theoretically predicted value) and deviating a little higher by a maximum of 4% near g = k nearly equal to 0.86, which was identified earlier to be the precursor point of criticality in several self-organized critical models (k = 0.80 corresponds to Pareto's 80-20 law). The Burridge-Knopoff model shows larger deviations from the k and g relation, but does not access the high inequality regime where an intersection occurs. This and some other quantitatively similar behaviors of the inequality indices across socio-economic and geophysical models may provide a coherent and comparative framework for identifying the subtle features in the statistics of such disparate dynamical systems.</description>
