      <title>Wilson loops as probes of phase transitions and conductivity phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wilson loops are among the most fundamental gauge-invariant observables in quantum field theory, encoding the global structure of gauge fields through their holonomy along closed contours. Originally introduced as order parameters for confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories, they have recently acquired a central role in condensed matter physics, where they characterize topological phases and quantized transport phenomena. In this work we present a unified theoretical picture in which Wilson loops connect nonperturbative gauge dynamics, Berry-phase topology in band theory, and the quantum Hall response of interacting electron systems. We demonstrate explicitly how Wilson loops encode Chern numbers, fractional charge, and anyonic braiding statistics within Chern--Simons effective field theory. Both quantized Hall conductivity and quasiparticle statistics are shown to originate from the same topological invariant -- the linking number of Wilson loops -- establishing a direct correspondence between microscopic topological structure and macroscopic transport.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Physics and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincar\'e group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program.</description>

      <title>Complexity and the Hilbert space dimension of 3D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in formulating a theory of quantum gravity is to determine the size and structure of the Hilbert space of black holes. Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectra of holographic diffusion: gauge fields breaking free from the master scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pseudospectra of quasinormal frequencies and complex linear momenta of a U(1) gauge field in a Schwarzschild black branes in Anti-de Sitter. We present a novel approach for computing the pseudospectra which uses directly the gauge field variables and contrast it to a conventional master scalar field approach. Upon clarifying a subtlety in the energy norm of the master scalar we show that the pseudospectra of both approaches conincide. In the hydrodynamic regime we find that the hydrodynamic quasinormal frequency, the diffusive mode, is spectrally stable to a very good approximation. On the other hand hydrodynamic complex linear momenta show enhanced spectral instability as a consequence of a pole-collision at zero frequency.</description>

      <title>From AdS to Flat Space: Massive Spin-2 Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a bulk effective field theory in AdS containing a U(1)-charged massive spin-2 field coupled to a gauge field, by performing the required holographic renormalization, and computing the one and two-point functions. We then compute the renormalized bulk three-point function involving two massive spin-2 fields and one gauge field. Matching with the CFT 3-point correlator of two non-conserved spin-2 operators and a conserved current, we obtain explicit mappings between the bulk minimal and gyromagnetic couplings and the boundary OPE data. Finally, we take the flat-space limit of the momentum space CFT correlator and verify that the resulting amplitude matches the expected flat-space structure.</description>

      <title>Modular Krylov Complexity as a Boundary Probe of Area Operator and Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the area operator of a quantum extremal surface can be reconstructed directly from boundary dynamics without reference to bulk geometry. Our approach combines the operator-algebra quantum error-correction (OAQEC) structure of AdS/CFT with modular Krylov complexity. Using Lanczos coefficients of boundary modular dynamics, we extract the spectrum of the modular Hamiltonian restricted to the algebra of the entanglement wedge and isolate its central contribution, which is identified with the area operator. The construction is purely boundary-based and applies to superpositions of semiclassical geometries as well. As an application, we diagnose island formation and the Page transition in evaporating black holes using boundary modular evolution alone, bypassing any bulk extremization. More broadly, our results establish modular Krylov complexity as a concrete and computable probe of emergent spacetime geometry, providing a new route to accessing black hole interiors from boundary quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Consistent Evaluation of the No-Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. To extract probabilities, one must use the gravitational path integral (GPI) to compute not only the no-boundary amplitude, but also the norms by which its square is divided. We find that this dramatically alters predictions: the probability for any closed universe is either nearly 1, or exactly 1. That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes. We find that all amplitudes are exactly 1 in this case, consistent with recent arguments that the statistical approach to the GPI with a closed boundary computes an average over one-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As an example, we illustrate the consistent evaluation of the no-boundary proposal in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Area terms and entanglement entropy in the $c=1$ string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study entanglement entropy in the low-energy effective field theory of two-dimensional string theory as well as in the singlet sector of the dual $c=1$ matrix quantum mechanics. From the target space perspective, we argue that a generic bulk subregion is expected to have an associated generalized entanglement entropy combining a dilaton-dependent gravitational term and a matter contribution coming from the tachyon. Given that the gravitational area-like term is absent in previous analyses of entanglement entropy in the $c=1$ model, we examine several possible mechanisms for its emergence. We show that the nonlocal transformation induced by the leg-pole factor that relates the target space tachyon and the matrix model collective excitations cannot account for the area-like term, and we comment on its possible origin in the non-singlet sectors of the theory.</description>

      <title>Verlinde lines, anyon permutations and commutant pairs inside $E_{8,1}$ CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a defect-theoretic refinement of meromorphic 2d CFTs in which the ordinary torus partition function -- often just the vacuum character -- does not reveal how states organize under symmetry lines. Our central proposal is an \emph{equatorial projection} framework: from a commutant decomposition into commuting rational chiral algebras with categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}$, we encode genus-one couplings by a non-negative integer matrix $M$ pairing characters and satisfying modular intertwiner relations. Invertible topological defect lines act directly on this gluing data (Verlinde lines diagonally via $S$-matrix eigenvalues, and anyon-permuting lines by braided-autoequivalence permutations), making modular covariance of defect amplitudes automatic and sharply distinguishing insertions that yield genuine modular invariants from those defining consistent non-holomorphic interfaces. We further show that the \emph{replacement rules} of \cite{Hegde:2021sdm, Lin:2019hks} arise as equatorial projections of defect actions, and we extend these constructions beyond two-character examples by systematically treating three-character commutant pairs in the $E_{8,1}$ theory. The unique $c=8$ meromorphic CFT $E_{8,1}$ serves as a universal testbed, producing new defect partition functions and clarifying the roles of $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathcal{C})$ and $\mathrm{Aut}^{\mathrm{br}}(\mathcal{C})$. Finally, we outline extensions to higher central charges (e.g.\ $c=32,40$), yielding modular-invariant non-meromorphic theories beyond the $c=24$ Schellekens landscape \cite{Schellekens:1992db} as defect/interface descendants of meromorphic parents.</description>

      <title>QCD Scattering Amplitudes and Prescriptive Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for the maximally-transcendental part of planar QCD scattering amplitudes and perform the first bootstrap computation of six-gluon MHV amplitudes in massless QCD at the symbol level. By analyzing the maximal weight projection of amplitudes at the integrand level, we relate their maximally-transcendental parts to prescriptive unitarity integrals. This reveals a novel analytic structure: the prefactors multiplying the functions of maximal transcendentality are identified with the four-dimensional leading singularities of the theory. As a consequence, these prefactors admit a complete classification and can be computed using on-shell diagrams, a formalism originally developed in $\mathcal{N}{=}4$ super Yang-Mills theory. As a concrete application, we determine the two-loop prefactors for planar MHV gluon amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity. Combining these prefactors with recent advances in the planar two-loop six-point function space and explicit six-point prescriptive-unitarity input, we construct a complete symbol ansatz and uniquely fix the maximally-transcendental part of the two-loop six-gluon MHV QCD amplitudes by imposing physical constraints. The resulting symbols are expressible in a reduced 137-letter alphabet, suggesting that this alphabet is complete for two-loop six-point massless MHV scattering. We also discuss the implications for multi-collinear splitting and multi-soft functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes aim to provide a pedagogical introduction to the AdS/CFT correspondence and its extensions to spacetimes with positive (de Sitter spacetime) and zero (flat spacetime) cosmological constant. We begin by explaining the physical motivation for holography and the significance of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We then review the basic ingredients of conformal field theory (CFT) and anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetime required to formulate the duality. Building on these foundations, we discuss the formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence and discuss several consistency checks that support it. We conclude with a brief discussion of holography in de Sitter and flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Note on higher spins and holographic symmetry algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a higher spin extension of the holographic symmetry algebra for graviton and gluon. Our primary observation is that in the presence of higher spin particles the soft symmetry algebra has a subalgebra isomorphic to $w_{\infty}$ which is generated by the \textit{conformally soft higher spin particles}. This $w_{\infty}$ subalgebra does not commute with the $w_{1+\infty}$ subalegbra generated by the conformally soft gravitons. The same thing holds for the colored higher spin particles. One gets a subalgebra isomorphic to the $S$-algebra which is generated by the conformally soft colored higher spin particles. We further verify the soft algebra for colored higher spin particles using the (tree-level) $4$-point MHV amplitude of the higher spin Yang-Mills theory constructed in arXiv:2210.07130. At the end we also discuss the higher spin extension of the deformed holographic symmetry algebra for non-zero cosmological constant as constructed in arXiv:2312.00876.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Page curve and information paradox for Kerr AdS black hole in light of entanglement entropy by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. By incorporating the island rule, we show that the entanglement entropy of Kerr AdS black hole grows linearly at early times and declines to a constant value at late times in agreement with the well established Page curve. The novelty of this study resides in the investigation of influence of phase transitions on the page curve in two different ensembles. We find that a first order phase transition results in a sharp discontinuity in the Page curve. We study the evaporation process in different scenarios and find that in all the situations, the Page curve doesn't violate the unitary principle of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Classifying Causal Nonlinear Electrodynamics via $\varphi$-Parity and Irrelevant Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the classification of self-dual nonlinear electrodynamic (NED) theories based on their analyticity properties, which are directly linked to invariance under a discrete $\varphi$-parity transformation. This classification is expressed through the structure of the irrelevant $T\bar{T}$-like deformations that generate the theories from a Maxwell seed. Using both closed-form and perturbative methods within the Courant-Hilbert (CH) and Russo-Townsend auxiliary field formalisms, we demonstrate a precise correspondence: $\varphi$-parity-invariant, analytic theories are generated by irrelevant deformations built from integer powers of the energy-momentum tensor scalars, $\mathcal{O}_\lambda \sim \sum C_m (T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})^{1-m}({T_{\mu}}^{\mu}{T_{\nu}}^{\nu})^{m}$. Conversely, $\varphi$-parity-violating, non-analytic theories require deformations involving both integer and half-integer powers, $\mathcal{O}_\lambda \sim \sum C_m (T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})^{1-m/2}({T_{\mu}}^{\mu}{T_{\nu}}^{\nu})^{m/2}$. We prove this result in generality via a perturbative CH framework, showing that $\varphi$-parity invariance imposes specific constraints on the expansion coefficients of the CH function $\ell(\tau)$ which, in turn, force all half-integer powers in the deformation to vanish. The classification is explicitly verified for known closed-form theories: the analytic generalized Born-Infeld model and the non-analytic examples of the $q=3/4$-deformed and "no $\tau$-maximum" theories. Furthermore, we show how the $\varphi$-parity transformation is consistently generalized in the presence of a marginal root-$T\bar{T}$ coupling $\gamma$, and we derive the corresponding marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the studied theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude, we provide an alternative but equivalent definition of the standard Mellin transform used to obtain celestial correlation functions. From this representation, we identify a celestial dispersion relation that relates the reduced correlation function to the poles and discontinuities of the bulk amplitude. By drawing an analogy with the standard CFT case, we define the celestial Regge limit and identify the relevant celestial CFT data in terms of the partial amplitudes governing the bulk Regge limit.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties.
  In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected.
  We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain.</description>

      <title>Observers, $\alpha$-parameters, and the Hartle-Hawking state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $\alpha$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $\alpha$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlator Discontinuities from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space.</description>

      <title>Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of charged Bardeen black holes in perfect fluid dark matter with a cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.</description>

      <title>The emergent Big Bang scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a new avenue for understanding the cosmological singularity. The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian free-fermion critical systems and logarithmic conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal invariance often accompanies criticality in Hermitian systems. However, its fate in non-Hermitian settings is less clear, especially near exceptional points where the Hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable. Here we investigate whether a 1+1-dimensional gapless non-Hermitian system can admit a conformal description, focusing on a PT-symmetric free-fermion field theory. Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters. We further present a microscopic construction and show how the same conformal data (with finite-size corrections) can be extracted from the lattice model at exceptional-point criticality, thereby supporting the field-theory prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of quantum monitoring in the dynamical manifestations of Hamiltonian quantum chaos. Specifically, we analyze the generalized spectral form factor, defined as the survival probability of a coherent Gibbs state under continuous energy measurements. We show that quantum monitoring can tailor the signatures of quantum chaos in the dynamics, such as the extension of the ramp in the spectral form factor, by varying the measurement strength and detection efficiency. In particular, a typical quantum trajectory obtained by monitoring with unit efficiency exhibits enhanced quantum chaos relative to the average dynamics and to unitary evolution without measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for "first-person" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her "subjective state". We advocate a "Principle of Self-Locating Indifference" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of "old evidence".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound is a key parameter for characterizing equilibrium states. However, sound waves change their properties when propagating through rapidly evolving anisotropic media, such as the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. This paper uses $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory to numerically study the time evolution of the speed and attenuation of sound modes along with the relaxation time in a plasma undergoing Bjorken expansion from various initial states in a quasi-static approximation. The longitudinal Bjorken expansion breaks the isotropy, resulting in two distinct sound speeds that range from just below the conformal value to the speed of light. An anisotropic hydrodynamic description is constructed and its applicability is discussed. Implications for the analysis of heavy ion data are considered.</description>

      <title>Inducing, and enhancing, many-body quantum chaos by continuous monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is intuitively expected, and supported by earlier studies, that many-body quantum chaos is suppressed, or even destroyed, by dissipative effects induced by continuous monitoring. We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana neutrino oscillations in a magnetic field are considered using the wave packets formalism. The modified Dirac equation for Majorana neutrinos with non-zero transition magnetic moments propagating in a magnetic field is solved analytically in the two flavour case. The expressions for the oscillations probabilities are derived accounting for the decoherence effect emerging at distances exceeding the coherence length. It is shown that for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a magnetic field the coherence length coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum when the vacuum frequency is much greater than the magnetic frequency ($\omega_{vac} \gg \omega_B$), while it is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum if ($\omega_{vac} \ll \omega_B$). We show that the decoherence effect may appear during neutrino propagation in a magnetic field of supernova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For specifically coupled values of the quadratic gravity parameters, we present a fully explicit static spherically symmetric solution. It contains the central singularity surrounded by the black-hole or the cosmological horizon for the negative or positive cosmological parameter, respectively. This spacetime, thus, belongs to the already analyzed classes of solutions expressed in terms of the Frobenius expansions, continuous fractions, or numerical simulations; however, it has not been explicitly identified before. The purpose of the presented highly-constrained somehow unphysical model is to reveal a global geometric picture that may occur in spherical spacetimes within quadratic gravity, which is typically hidden in more general approximative solutions. At the same time, it can serve as a solid benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of the methods employed to obtain such solutions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a 3.0$\sigma$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field effects on spherical orbit in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime: constraints from jet precession of M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported precession period of about $11.24$ years of the M87* jet provides a sensitive probe of strong field gravity and the electromagnetic environment in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes. In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B&lt;0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B&lt;0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Linear perturbations of an exact gravitational wave in the Bianchi IV universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proper-time method for constructing perturbative dynamical gravitational fields is presented. Using the proper-time method, a perturbative analytical model of gravitational waves against the backdrop of an exact wave solution of Einstein's equations in a Bianchi IV universe is constructed. To construct the perturbative analytical wave model a privileged wave coordinate system and a synchronous time function associated with the proper time of an observer freely moving in a gravitational wave were used. Reduction of the field equations, taking into account compatibility conditions, reduces the mathematical model of gravitational waves to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for functions of the wave variable. Analytical solutions for the components of the gravitational-wave metric have been found. The stability of the resulting perturbative solutions is proven. The stability of the exact solution for a gravitational wave in the anisotropic Bianchi IV universe is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Higher-Form Connections in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general definition of higher-form connections on principal $\infty$-bundles in differential geometry. This is achieved by developing the formal differentiation and integration of maps from smooth manifolds to derived stacks with sufficient deformation theory. That allows us to introduce the Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid of a principal $\infty$-bundle and establish its global sections as the $L_\infty$-algebra of the derived higher symmetry group of the bundle. We define the space of $p$-form connections on an $\infty$-bundle as the space of order $p$ splittings of its Atiyah $L_\infty$-algebroid. We demonstrate that our new concept of derived geometric $p$-form connections recovers the known notion of connections on higher U(1)-bundles defined via \v{C}ech-Deligne differential cocycles. We further relate the $L_\infty$-algebras of derived higher symmetries of higher U(1)-bundles and higher Courant algebroids. Some applications in higher gauge theory and in supergravity are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Calculating Feynman diagrams with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text reviews, hopefully in a pedagogical manner, a series of work on the automatic calculations of Feynman diagrams in the context of quantum nanoelectronics (Keldysh formalism) with an application to the Kondo effect in the out-of-equilibrium single impurity Anderson model. It includes a discussion of (A) how to deal with the proliferation of diagrams, (B) how to calculate them using the Tensor Cross Interpolation algorithm instead of Monte-Carlo and (C) how to resum the obtained series. These notes correspond to a lecture given at the Autumn School on Correlated Electrons 2025 in Jullich, Germany. The book with all the lectures of the school (edited by Eva Pavarini, Erik Koch, Alexander Lichtenstein, and Dieter Vollhardt) is available in open access.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein's bound for wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a spatial region of width $2R$ and $\Phi$ a Klein-Gordon wave packet localized in $B$ at time zero. We show the inequality $S \leq 2\pi R E$; here, $S$ is the entropy of $\Phi$ contained in a region $B$, and $E$ is the energy content of $\Phi$ within $B$. We consider a wider setting and formulate a variational problem aimed at minimizing our bound when $\Phi$ is not localized in $B$. Our inequality holds in more generality in the framework of local, Poincar\'e covariant nets of standard subspaces and is related to the Bekenstein inequality. We point out a general bound that is compatible with the recent numerical computations by Bostelmann, Cadamuro, and Minz concerning the one-particle modular Hamiltonian of a scalar massive quantum Klein-Gordon field. We also provide a version of the entropy balance and ant formulas for wave packets.</description>

      <title>Dirac Observables for Gowdy Cosmologies regular at the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gowdy cosmologies are exact, spatially inhomogeneous solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations which describe nonlinear gravitational waves coalescing at the Big Bang singularity. With toroidal spatial sections they provenly have the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property, in that close to the Big Bang dynamical spatial gradients fade out and the dynamics is governed by a Carroll-type gravity theory. Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-restoring finite counterterms of SMEFT four-fermion operator insertions at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some effects induced by SMEFT operators at one loop have attracted a lot of attention in recent years, in particular, the renormalization of divergences by physical operators in single insertions of dimension-6 operators. Important non-logarithmically enhanced contributions must also be calculated. We discuss dimensional regularization in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme. The goal here consists of determining in this scheme quantum effects in chiral theories at one loop. Namely, the determination of finite counterterms at one loop that reestablish the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which follow from gauge symmetries. These counterterms are necessary due to the presence of evanescent symmetry-breaking terms in the classical Lagrangian needed to regularize fermion propagators. We consider a technique that allows an easier calculation of such finite effects, relying on the identification of $(D-4)/(D-4)$ terms of one-loop amplitudes with an external ghost leg. We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms. This represents one step towards moving to higher order calculations.</description>

      <title>Temperature driven false vacuum decay in coherently coupled Bose superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a quantum field from a metastable state (false vacuum) to a stable one (true vacuum), also known as false vacuum decay, is a fundamental problem in quantum field theory and cosmology. We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Exploring Higgs EFT in $t\bar{t}hh$ at High Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-resonant production of a Higgs boson pair in association with a top-antitop quark pair ($pp\rightarrow t\bar{t}hh$) has only recently begun to be explored at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and provides a unique and largely uncharted probe of the top-Higgs sector, offering complementary sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling and higher-dimensional interactions beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $\delta\kappa_\lambda$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>A Unified Categorical Description of Quantum Hall Hierarchy and Anyon Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified category-theoretic framework for quantum Hall hierarchy constructions and anyon superconductivity based on modular tensor categories over $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{U}(1))$ and $\mathrm{sRep}(\mathrm{U}(1)^f)$. Our approach explicitly incorporates conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge and formulates doping via a generalized stack-and-condense procedure, in which an auxiliary topological order is stacked onto the parent phase, and the quasiparticles created by doping subsequently condense. Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra. Our framework reproduces all known anyon superconductors obtained from field-theoretic analyses and further predicts novel phases, including a charge-$2e$ anyon superconductor derived from the Laughlin state and charge-$ke$ anyon superconductors arising from bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_k$ Read-Rezayi states. By placing hierarchy transitions and anyon superconductivity within a single mathematical formalism, our work provides a unified understanding of competing and proximate phases near experimentally realizable fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Can negative bare couplings make sense? The $\vec{\phi}^4$ theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02516v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in 3+1D, for a positive coupling constant $\lambda&gt;0$, is known to have no interacting continuum limit, which is referred to as quantum triviality. However, it has been recently argued that the theory in 3+1D with an $N$-component scalar $\vec{\phi}$ and a $(\vec{\phi}\cdot\vec{\phi})^{\,2}=\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ interaction term does have an interacting continuum limit at large $N$. It has been suggested that this continuum limit has a negative (bare) coupling constant and exhibits asymptotic freedom, similar to the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric $-g\phi^4$ field theory. In this paper I study the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory in 3+1D at large $N$ with a negative coupling constant $-g&lt;0$, and with the scalar field taking values in a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric complex domain. The theory is non-trivial, has asymptotic freedom, and has a Landau pole in the IR, and I demonstrate that the thermal partition function matches that of the positive-coupling $\lambda&gt;0$ theory when the Landau poles of the two theories (in the $\lambda&gt;0$ case a pole in the UV) are identified with one another. The spirit of renormalization is that observables do not depend on the renormalization scale. Here we see even if the coupling is taken negative above the scale of the Landau pole, thermodynamic observables are unaffected. Thus the $\vec{\phi}^{\,4}$ theory at large $N$ appears to have a negative bare coupling constant; the coupling only becomes positive in the IR, which in the context of other $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric and large-$N$ quantum field theories I argue is perfectly acceptable.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>A novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory: classical and quantum aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlocal spin-1/2 theory in which the form factor depends on the Dirac operator rather than on the d'Alembert operator. In this scenario, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of this new theory. At the classical level, we investigate the dispersion relation of free spin-1/2 particles and find that it increasingly deviates from the standard case as the nonlocal effects become relevant. At the quantum level, we compute the fermionic one-loop effective action for the nonlocal spin-1/2 theory with Yukawa coupling and show that the contributions of nonlocal effects are significant in the UV limit, while in the IR they are suppressed by a UV cutoff scale, which has been chosen to coincide with the nonlocality scale $\Lambda$. We minimally couple a $U(1)$ gauge field to the nonlocal spin-1/2 field theory and explicitly demonstrate that this theory is gauge invariant. Finally, we obtain a nonlocal version of the Pauli equation and the impact of the nonlocality in the $g$-factor of massive particles.</description>

      <title>Integrable spin chains in twisted maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an angular dipole deformation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) that preserves its classical scale invariance. We show that two-point functions of suitable single trace operators, restricted to an invariant plane, are determined by scaling dimensions computable from an integrable spin chain. This spin chain is a diagonally twisted version of the famous integrable spin chain of SYM. It matches expectations from the dual string theory perfectly, presenting a precision test of holography in this new setting, and an important step to understanding general twisted integrable AdS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>BPS Solutions of 4d Euclidean N=2 Supergravity with Higher Derivative Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fully BPS and a broad class of half-BPS stationary configurations of four-dimensional Euclidean N=2 supergravity with higher-derivative interactions. Working within the off-shell conformal supergravity framework of de Wit and Reys (arXiv:1706.04973), we analyse the complete set of Killing spinor equations and obtain the corresponding algebraic and differential constraints. We further derive the Euclidean attractor equations and evaluate the Wald entropy for the fully BPS AdS_2 x S^2 background. For half-BPS stationary configurations, we obtain the generalized stabilization equations expressing all fields in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, extending the Lorentzian analysis of Cardoso et al (arXiv:hep-th/0009234) to the Euclidean signature. Our results provide a framework for studying supersymmetric saddles and computing the gravitational indices entirely within Euclidean higher-derivative supergravity, without recourse to analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation, which completely lifts the energy degeneracy, generates a stronger enhancement. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth, across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.</description>

Abstract: We explain why the surprising one-loop finiteness of 6D half-maximal supergravities recently discovered in \cite{Huang:2025nyr} is the result of the cancellation of the six-dimensional gravitational and gauge anomalies in (2,0) supergravity with 21 tensor multiplets and its anomaly-free SO(5, 21) duality. The one-loop finiteness of (1,1) supergravity with 20 vector multiplets is also explained by anomaly-free SO(4, 20) duality symmetry.</description>

      <title>Critical and multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points in the local potential approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\eta$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\Delta=(d-2+\eta)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n&gt;1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.</description>

      <title>Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be canceled by contributions from the radiative memory region, while its dimensional-regularisation pole should cancel against the radiative tail region. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Novel five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes with electric and axionic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a new family of exact charged and rotating asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in five dimensions. The spacetime solves Einstein equations coupled to a dilaton, two Abelian gauge fields, and axionic scalars supplemented by two generalized Chern-Simons terms. This configuration is characterized by a range of the free dynamical exponent $z$ and possesses nontrivial thermodynamical parameters, where we verify the first law of black hole thermodynamics and derive the corresponding Smarr relation. Motivated by applications to gauge/gravity duality, we then investigate a holographic superconductor in the rotating Lifshitz background. We study the condensation of the scalar operator and the AC conductivity of the dual system. These results show that increasing the rotation parameter suppresses the condensate and weakens the superconducting phase, while increasing the dynamical critical exponent enhances the superconducting order. To the best of our knowledge, the solutions presented here are the first to demonstrate five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes supported by both electric and axionic charges. This opens up a new avenue to investigate non-relativistic holography beyond static backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition at weak coupling in two-color matrix QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the matrix model of two-color one-flavor adjoint QCD (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}^{\text{adj}}$) in the weak coupling regime (small $g$) and in the chiral limit. The Yang-Mills potential has two distinct gauge invariant minima: one at $A_i=0$ and the other at $A_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{2g}$. We show that when the chiral chemical potential $c \leq \frac{3}{2}$, there is a quantum phase transition at $g_0^\ast \simeq 0.143$: for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state wavefunction is localized near $A_i=0$, while for $g&gt;g_0^\ast$, the ground state is delocalized over the gauge configuration space. The transition between these two phases is singular, with the ground state at $g_0^\ast$ being distinctly different from that of $g_0^\ast \pm|\epsilon|$. At $g_0^\ast$, we show that the square of the chromoelectric field vanishes, strongly suggesting that the system is in a ``dual superconductor" phase. Numerical evidence shows that the localization-delocalization phenomenon holds for the 1st and 2nd excited states as well, leading us to conjecture that there are an infinite number of isolated singular points $g_0^\ast&gt; g_1^\ast&gt;g_2^\ast&gt; \cdots$ accumulating to $g=0$. For $c=1$, the model formally possesses $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. We show that in the localized phase (i.e. for $g&lt;g_0^\ast$) the supermultiplet structure is disrupted and SUSY is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.02941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freed-Hopkins give a mathematical ansatz for classifying gapped invertible phases of matter with a spatial symmetry in terms of Borel-equivariant generalized homology. We propose a slight generalization of this ansatz to account for cases where the symmetry type mixes nontrivially with the spatial symmetry, such as crystalline phases with spin-1/2 fermions. From this ansatz, we prove as a theorem a "fermionic crystalline equivalence principle," as predicted in the physics literature. Using this and the Adams spectral sequence, we compute classifications of some classes of phases with a point group symmetry; in cases where these phases have been studied by other methods, our results agree with the literature.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18), DES and BAO observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is mildly favored by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Noninflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</description>

      <title>Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to a naturally induced gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer--Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer--Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.</description>

      <title>Covariant Measures of Non-Markovianity in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.</description>

      <title>Tidal perturbations of an extreme mass ratio inspiral around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the metric of a Kerr black hole subject to external tidal fields using metric reconstruction techniques. Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>The FRW Universe as a van der Waals-like Thermodynamic Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is a dynamical spacetime, and it has thermodynamics embodied on the apparent horizon. Notably, it also possesses a van der Waals-like equation of state, enabling us to consider thermodynamic cycles and explore the potential of the FRW universe as a heat engine. In this paper, we investigate two types of cycle--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit. This finding is in alignment with the traditional thermodynamic principles that govern heat engines.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

      <title>Classical emergence of the quantum-backreacted BTZ black hole from exponential electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a recently reported generalization of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole arising in New Massive Gravity sourced by the quantum fluctuations of scalar matter, now examined through the lens of a purely classical framework. We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer-Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Branch structure and nonextensive thermodynamics of Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black holes: observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $\zeta=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing is analyzed using the Ono-Ishihara-Asada extension of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which is required by the non-Euclidean asymptotic structure of the Kalb-Ramond optical geometry and yields a negative topological correction that reduces light bending relative to the Schwarzschild baseline. Photon propagation in plasma and tidal forces are also studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches.</description>
