      <title>Predicting Fine-grained Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia Based on Machine Learning and Smart Wearable Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) impact dementia care substantially, affecting both patients and caregivers. Effective management and early detection of BPSD are crucial to reduce the stress and burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. Despite the advancements in machine learning for dementia prediction, there is a considerable gap in utilizing these methods for BPSD prediction. This study aims to fill this gap by presenting a novel personalized framework for BPSD prediction, utilizing physiological signals from smart wearable devices. Our personalized fine-grained BPSD prediction method accurately predicts BPSD occurrences by extracting individual behavioral patterns, while the generalized models identify diverse patterns and differentiate between various BPSD symptoms. Detailed comparisons between the proposed personalized method and conventional generalized methods reveals substantial improvements across all performance metrics, including a 16.0% increase in AUC. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method in advancing dementia care by enabling proactive interventions and improving patient outcomes in real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that leverages physiological signals from smart wearable devices to predict BPSD, marking a significant stride in dementia care research.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Radio Map Construction with Real Environments and Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map construction based on extensive measurements is accurate but expensive and time-consuming, while environment-aware radio map estimation reduces the costs at the expense of low accuracy. Considering accuracy and costs, a first-predict-then-correct (FPTC) method is proposed by leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs). A primary radio map is first predicted by a radio map prediction GAN (RMP-GAN) taking environmental information as input. Then, the prediction result is corrected by a radio map correction GAN (RMC-GAN) with sparse measurements as guidelines. Specifically, the self-attention mechanism and residual-connection blocks are introduced to RMP-GAN and RMC-GAN to improve the accuracy, respectively. Experimental results validate that the proposed FPTC-GANs method achieves the best radio map construction performance, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Graph Neural Network for Enhanced EEG-Based Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are becoming increasingly popular for EEG-based depression detection. However, previous GNN-based methods fail to sufficiently consider the characteristics of depression, thus limiting their performance. Firstly, studies in neuroscience indicate that depression patients exhibit both common and individualized brain abnormal patterns. Previous GNN-based approaches typically focus either on fixed graph connections to capture common abnormal brain patterns or on adaptive connections to capture individualized patterns, which is inadequate for depression detection. Secondly, brain network exhibits a hierarchical structure, which includes the arrangement from channel-level graph to region-level graph. This hierarchical structure varies among individuals and contains significant information relevant to detecting depression. Nonetheless, previous GNN-based methods overlook these individualized hierarchical information. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid GNN (HGNN) that merges a Common Graph Neural Network (CGNN) branch utilizing fixed connection and an Individualized Graph Neural Network (IGNN) branch employing adaptive connections. The two branches capture common and individualized depression patterns respectively, complementing each other. Furthermore, we enhance the IGNN branch with a Graph Pooling and Unpooling Module (GPUM) to extract individualized hierarchical information. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction with prior support information and non-Gaussian constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the Weighted Basis Pursuit Dequantization ($\omega$-BPDQ$_p$), which incorporates prior support information by assigning weights on the $\ell_1$ norm in the $\ell_1$ minimization process and replaces the $\ell_2$ norm with the $\ell_p$ norm in the constraint. This adjustment addresses cases where noise deviates from a Gaussian distribution, such as quantized errors, which are common in practice. We demonstrate that Restricted Isometry Property (RIP$_{p,q}$) and Weighted Robust Null Space Property ($\omega$-RNSP$_{p,q}$) ensure stable and robust reconstruction within $\omega$-BPDQ$_p$, with the added observation that standard Gaussian random matrices satisfy these properties with high probability. Moreover, we establish a relationship between RIP$_{p,q}$ and $\omega$-RNSP$_{p,q}$ that RIP$_{p,q}$ implies $\omega$-RNSP$_{p,q}$. Additionally, numerical experiments confirm that the incorporation of weights and the non-Gaussian constraint results in improved reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Attention Neural Network Performance for Marijuana Consumption Classification through Large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) Analysis of Functional MR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</description>

      <title>Remote Detection of Applications for Improved Beam Tracking in mmWave/sub-THz 5G/6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam tracking is an essential functionality of millimeter wave (mmWave, 30-100 GHz) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100-300 GHz) 5G/6G systems. It operates by performing antenna sweeping at both base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) sides using the Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB). The optimal frequency of beam tracking events is not specified by 3GPP standards and heavily depends on the micromobility properties of the applications currently utilized by the user. In absence of explicit signalling for the type of application at the air interface, in this paper, we propose a way to remotely detect it at the BS side based on the received signal strength pattern. To this aim, we first perform a multi-stage measurement campaign at 156 GHz, belonging to the sub-THz band, to obtain the received signal strength traces of popular smartphone applications. Then, we proceed applying conventional statistical Mann-Whitney tests and various machine learning (ML) based classification techniques to discriminate applications remotely. Our results show that Mann-Whitney test can be used to differentiate between fast and slow application classes with a confidence of 0.95 inducing class detection delay on the order of 1 s after application initialization. With the same time budget, random forest classifiers can differentiate between applications with fast and slow micromobility with 80% accuracy using received signal strength metric only. The accuracy of detecting a specific application however is lower, reaching 60%. By utilizing the proposed technique one can estimate the optimal values of the beam tracking intervals without adding additional signalling to the air interface.</description>

      <title>Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO OFDM with Phase Noise-Aware Channel Estimation: Separate and Shared LOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) networks enhance coverage and spectral efficiency (SE) by distributing antennas across access points (APs) with phase coherence between APs. However, the use of cost-efficient local oscillators (LOs) introduces phase noise (PN) that compromises phase coherence, even with centralized processing. Sharing an LO across APs can reduce costs in specific configurations but cause correlated PN between APs, leading to correlated interference that affects centralized combining. This can be improved by exploiting the PN correlation in channel estimation. This paper presents an uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal model for PN-impaired cell-free mMIMO, addressing gaps in single-carrier signal models. We evaluate mismatches from applying single-carrier methods to OFDM systems, showing how they underestimate the impact of PN and produce over-optimistic achievable SE predictions. Based on our OFDM signal model, we propose two PN-aware channel and common phase error estimators: a distributed estimator for uncorrelated PN with separate LOs and a centralized estimator with shared LOs. We introduce a deep learning-based channel estimator to enhance the performance and reduce the number of iterations of the centralized estimator. The simulation results show that the distributed estimator outperforms mismatched estimators with separate LOs, whereas the centralized estimator enhances distributed estimators with shared LOs.</description>

      <title>Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional self-interference cancellation (SIC) methods are common in full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, exploring new SIC schemes is important due to the limitations of traditional approaches. With the challenging limitations of traditional SIC approaches, this paper proposes a novel simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-enabled FD ISAC system, where STAR-RIS enhances simultaneous communication and target sensing and reduces self-interference (SI) to a level comparable to traditional SIC approaches. The optimization of maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the communication sum rate, both crucial for improving sensing accuracy and overall communication performance, presents significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of these problems. Therefore, we develop alternating optimization algorithms to iteratively tackle these problems. Specifically, we devise the semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for transmit beamformer design. For the reflecting and refracting coefficients design, we adopt the successive convex approximation (SCA) method and implement the SDR-based algorithm to tackle the quartic and quadratic constraints. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed deployment can achieve better performance than that of the benchmark using the traditional SIC approach without STAR-RIS deployment.</description>

      <title>Sensing Accuracy Optimization for Communication-assisted Dual-baseline UAV-InSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimization of the sensing accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based dual-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) systems. A swarm of three UAV-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems is deployed to image an area of interest from different angles, enabling the creation of two independent digital elevation models (DEMs). To reduce the InSAR sensing error, i.e., the height estimation error, the two DEMs are fused based on weighted average techniques into one final DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the ground. To this end, the radar data is offloaded in real time via a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground backhaul link. In this work, we focus on improving the sensing accuracy by minimizing the worst-case height estimation error of the final DEM. To this end, the UAV formation and the power allocated for offloading are jointly optimized based on alternating optimization (AO), while meeting practical InSAR sensing and communication constraints. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can improve the sensing accuracy by over 39% compared to a classical single-baseline UAV-InSAR system and by more than 12% compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>POMDP-Driven Cognitive Massive MIMO Radar: Joint Target Detection-Tracking In Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint detection and tracking of a moving target embedded in an unknown disturbance represents a key feature that motivates the development of the cognitive radar paradigm. Building upon recent advancements in robust target detection with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, this work explores the application of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to enhance the tracking and detection tasks in a statistically unknown environment. In the POMDP setup, the radar system is considered as an intelligent agent that continuously senses the surrounding environment, optimizing its actions to maximize the probability of detection $(P_D)$ and improve the target position and velocity estimation, all this while keeping a constant probability of false alarm $(P_{FA})$. The proposed approach employs an online algorithm that does not require any apriori knowledge of the noise statistics, and it relies on a much more general observation model than the traditional range-azimuth-elevation model employed by conventional tracking algorithms. Simulation results clearly show substantial performance improvement of the POMDP-based algorithm compared to the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)-based one that has been recently investigated in the context of massive MIMO (MMIMO) radar systems.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning for detecting atrial fibrillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered clinical arrhythmia associated with stroke and increased mortality. Since professional medical knowledge is required for annotation, exploiting a large corpus of ECGs to develop accurate supervised learning-based atrial fibrillation algorithms remains challenging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising recipe for generalized ECG representation learning, eliminating the dependence on expensive labeling. However, without well-designed incorporations of knowledge related to atrial fibrillation, existing SSL approaches typically suffer from unsatisfactory capture of robust ECG representations. In this paper, we propose an inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning approach. Considering ECGs of atrial fibrillation patients exhibit the irregularity in RR intervals and the absence of P-waves, we develop specific pre-training tasks for interperiod and intraperiod representations, aiming to learn the single-period stable morphology representation while retaining crucial interperiod features. After further fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable AUC performances on the BTCH dataset, \textit{i.e.}, 0.953/0.996 for paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation detection. On commonly used benchmarks of CinC2017 and CPSC2021, the generalization capability and effectiveness of our methodology are substantiated with competitive results.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Training Data with Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Classifying RF Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) communication has been an important part of civil and military communication for decades. With the increasing complexity of wireless environments and the growing number of devices sharing the spectrum, it has become critical to efficiently manage and classify the signals that populate these frequencies. In such scenarios, the accurate classification of wireless signals is essential for effective spectrum management, signal interception, and interference mitigation. However, the classification of wireless RF signals often faces challenges due to the limited availability of labeled training data, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the use of a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to augment training data, thereby enhancing the performance of a baseline wireless classifier. The VQ-VAE model generates high-fidelity synthetic RF signals, increasing the diversity and fidelity of the training dataset by capturing the complex variations inherent in RF communication signals. Our experimental results show that incorporating VQ-VAE-generated data significantly improves the classification accuracy of the baseline model, particularly in low SNR conditions. This augmentation leads to better generalization and robustness of the classifier, overcoming the constraints imposed by limited real-world data. By improving RF signal classification, the proposed approach enhances the efficacy of wireless communication in both civil and tactical settings, ensuring reliable and secure operations. This advancement supports critical decision-making and operational readiness in environments where communication fidelity is essential.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Low-Thrust Maneuvering Spacecraft Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian estimation with an explicit transitional prior is required for a tracking algorithm to be embedded in most multi-target tracking frameworks. This paper describes a novel approach capable of tracking maneuvering spacecraft with an explicit transitional prior and in a Bayesian framework, with fewer than two observations passes per day. The algorithm samples thrust profiles according to a multivariate Laplace distribution. It is shown that multivariate Laplace distributions are particularly suited to track maneuvering spacecraft, leading to a log probability function that is almost linear with the thrust. Principles from rare event simulation theory are used to propagate the tails of the distribution. Fast propagation is enabled by multi-fidelity methods. Because of the diffuse transitional prior, a novel k-nearest neighbor-based ensemble Gaussian mixture filter is developed and used.The method allows Bayesian tracking of maneuvering spacecraft for several scenarios with fewer than two measurement passes per day, and with a mismatch between the true and expected thrust magnitude of up to a factor of 200. The validity domain and statistical significance of the method are shown by simulation through several Monte Carlo trials in different scenarios and with different filter settings.</description>

      <title>LEO-based Positioning: Foundations, Signal Design, and Receiver Enhancements for 6G NTN</title>

Abstract: The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into 5G new radio (NR) has opened up the possibility of developing a new positioning infrastructure using NR signals from Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. LEO-based cellular positioning offers several advantages, such as a superior link budget, higher operating bandwidth, and large forthcoming constellations. Due to these factors, LEO-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) is a potential enhancement for NTN in 6G cellular networks. However, extending the existing terrestrial cellular positioning methods to LEO-based NTN positioning requires considering key fundamental enhancements. These include creating broad positioning beams orthogonal to conventional communication beams, time-domain processing at the user equipment (UE) to resolve large delay and Doppler uncertainties, and efficiently accommodating positioning reference signals (PRS) from multiple satellites within the communication resource grid. In this paper, we present the first set of design insights by incorporating these enhancements and thoroughly evaluating LEO-based positioning, considering the constraints and capabilities of the NR-NTN physical layer. To evaluate the performance of LEO-based NTN positioning, we develop a comprehensive NR-compliant simulation framework, including LEO orbit simulation, transmission (Tx) and receiver (Rx) architectures, and a positioning engine incorporating the necessary enhancements. Our findings suggest that LEO-based NTN positioning could serve as a complementary infrastructure to existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and, with appropriate enhancements, may also offer a viable alternative.</description>

      <title>Position-Aided Semantic Communication for Efficient Image Transmission: Design, Implementation, and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication, augmented by knowledge bases (KBs), offers substantial reductions in transmission overhead and resilience to errors. However, existing methods predominantly rely on end-to-end training to construct KBs, often failing to fully capitalize on the rich information available at communication devices. Motivated by the growing convergence of sensing and communication, we introduce a novel Position-Aided Semantic Communication (PASC) framework, which integrates localization into semantic transmission. This framework is particularly designed for position-based image communication, such as real-time uploading of outdoor camera-view images. By utilizing the position, the framework retrieves corresponding maps, and then an advanced foundation model (FM)-driven view generator is employed to synthesize images closely resembling the target images. The PASC framework further leverages the FM to fuse the synthesized image with deviations from the real one, enhancing semantic reconstruction. Notably, the framework is highly flexible, capable of adapting to dynamic content and fluctuating channel conditions through a novel FM-based parameter optimization strategy. Additionally, the challenges of real-time deployment are addressed, with the development of a hardware testbed to validate the framework. Simulations and real-world tests demonstrate that the proposed PASC approach not only significantly boosts transmission efficiency, but also remains robust in diverse and evolving transmission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Communication-Computing-Control Closed-Loop Optimization for 6G Unmanned Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in field robots have brought a new kind of cyber physical system (CPS)--unmanned robotic system--under the spotlight. In the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) era, these systems hold great potential to replace humans in hazardous tasks. This paper investigates an unmanned robotic system comprising a multi-functional unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), sensors, and actuators. The UAV carries communication and computing modules, acting as an edge information hub (EIH) that transfers and processes information. During the task execution, the EIH gathers sensing data, calculates control commands, and transmits commands to actuators--leading to reflex-arc-like sensing-communication-computing-control ($\mathbf{SC}^3$) loops. Unlike existing studies that design $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loop components separately, we take each $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loop as an integrated structure and propose a goal-oriented closed-loop optimization scheme. This scheme jointly optimizes uplink and downlink (UL&amp;DL) communication and computing within and across the $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loops to minimize the total linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost. We derive optimal closed-form solutions for intra-loop allocation and propose an efficient iterative algorithm for inter-loop optimization. Under the condition of adequate CPU frequency availability, we derive an approximate closed-form solution for inter-loop bandwidth allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a two-tier task-level balance within and across $\mathbf{SC}^3$ loops.</description>

      <title>A framework for GNSS-based solutions performance analysis in an ERTMS context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context Progresses in GNSS-based solution introduction in rail applications GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is now used in most of our travels and each of our smartphone apps. Most of the usages are not safety-critical. But Europe identified GNSS for more applications and to be integrated in rail in general as part of the toolset to help railway to contribute to reduce transport carbon footprint. To increase the use of trains in European transports, railways must improve their attractiveness for passengers and freight, but also increase reliability, availability and efficiency by reducing capital expenditure and operational costs. GNSS is part of the global digitalization scheme of freight that aims to offer added value to the clients knowledge of accurate time of arrival, continuous monitoring of transport conditions (temperature, humidity...). But a major challenge will be to reach stringent applications and in particular, GNSS is today seen as a realistic and serious game changer for the future of the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System). The localisation function is today performed with both odometry and balises. Odometer provides a continuous train position in time from a reference point. But as the distance delivered by the odometer shows a growing bias with distance, due to wear and wheel sliding, the use of on-track balises allows to reduce this error. Future systems will be based on on-board localisation solutions with GNSS receivers. It will allow the development of new concepts for moving blocks, virtual coupling and automation. Its use for train integrity is also investigated. But the environmental conditions of track and surroundings configuration, i.e, tunnels, dense urban areas or vegetation often degrade positioning performance and thus its efficiency and safety. Indeed, GNSS satellites are moving and their visibility (availability and relative position from the receiver) vary with time. Moreover, for optimal performance, the system requires open sky environments, which are the cases of most of the aeronautical uses but not of train uses. Trains often circulate in areas where signal reception can be disturbed (multipath, intentional or unintentional interferences) and thus, performances degraded. If many progresses have been made in the past years to develop more robust receivers [Puccitelli, 2022], multi-sensor solutions [CLUG website] or missing tools such as Digital Maps [Crespillo, 2023], in projects such as the Shift2Rail Project X2Rail-5 or CLUG, some questions remain and in particular related to performance evaluation. How can we evaluate performances in a dynamic environment (train, satellite, obstacles)? How can we be sure that every configuration has been tested? What is the impact of a failure (inaccuracy, missed detection) on operation? Some of these issues are addressed in the on-going R2DATO project funded by Europe's rail.</description>

      <title>Wavetable Synthesis Using CVAE for Timbre Control Based on Semantic Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizers are essential in modern music production. However, their complex timbre parameters, often filled with technical terms, require expertise. This research introduces a method of timbre control in wavetable synthesis that is intuitive and sensible and utilizes semantic labels. Using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), users can select a wavetable and define the timbre with labels such as bright, warm, and rich. The CVAE model, featuring convolutional and upsampling layers, effectively captures the wavetable nuances, ensuring real-time performance owing to their processing in the time domain. Experiments demonstrate that this approach allows for real-time, effective control of the timbre of the wavetable using semantic inputs and aims for intuitive timbre control through data-based semantic control.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Image Resolution: Super-Resolution Algorithm for Enhanced EOS-06 OCM-3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ocean Color Monitor-3 (OCM-3) sensor is instrumental in Earth observation, achieving a critical balance between high-resolution imaging and broad coverage. This paper explores innovative imaging methods employed in OCM-3 and the transformative potential of super-resolution techniques to enhance image quality. The super-resolution model for OCM-3 (SOCM-3) addresses the challenges of contemporary satellite imaging by effectively navigating the trade-off between image clarity and swath width. With resolutions below 240 meters in Local Area Coverage (LAC) mode and below 750 meters in Global Area Coverage (GAC) mode, coupled with a wide 1550-kilometer swath and a 2-day revisit time, SOCM-3 emerges as a leading asset in remote sensing. The paper details the intricate interplay of atmospheric, motion, optical, and detector effects that impact image quality, emphasizing the necessity for advanced computational techniques and sophisticated algorithms for effective image reconstruction. Evaluation methods are thoroughly discussed, incorporating visual assessments using the Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) metric and computational metrics such as Line Spread Function (LSF), Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), and Super-Resolution (SR) ratio. Additionally, statistical analyses, including power spectrum evaluations and target-wise spectral signatures, are employed to gauge the efficacy of super-resolution techniques. By enhancing both spatial resolution and revisit frequency, this study highlights significant advancements in remote sensing capabilities, providing valuable insights for applications across cryospheric, vegetation, oceanic, coastal, and domains. Ultimately, the findings underscore the potential of SOCM-3 to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of finescale oceanic phenomena and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to unknown low dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this prior work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Our theory is established based on a key observation: the DDPM update rule is equivalent to running a suitably parameterized SDE upon discretization, where the nonlinear component of the drift term is intrinsically low-dimensional.</description>

      <title>On the Crucial Role of Initialization for Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization, which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks. Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known. Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>An Unobtrusive and Lightweight Ear-worn System for Continuous Epileptic Seizure Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases globally (around 50 million people worldwide). Fortunately, up to 70% of people with epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated, and a reliable technique to monitor the onset of seizures could improve the quality of life of patients who are constantly facing the fear of random seizure attacks. The scalp-based EEG test, despite being the gold standard for diagnosing epilepsy, is costly, necessitates hospitalization, demands skilled professionals for operation, and is discomforting for users. In this paper, we propose EarSD, a novel lightweight, unobtrusive, and socially acceptable ear-worn system to detect epileptic seizure onsets by measuring the physiological signals from behind the user's ears. EarSD includes an integrated custom-built sensing-computing-communication PCB to collect and amplify the signals of interest, remove the noises caused by motion artifacts and environmental impacts, and stream the data wirelessly to the computer/mobile phone nearby, where data are uploaded to the host computer for further processing. We conducted both in-lab and in-hospital experiments with epileptic seizure patients who were hospitalized for seizure studies.</description>

      <title>Time vs. Frequency Domain DPD for Massive MIMO: Methods and Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of up to hundreds of antennas in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) poses a complexity challenge for digital predistortion (DPD) aiming to linearize the nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs). While the complexity for conventional time domain (TD) DPD scales with the number of PAs, frequency domain (FD) DPD has a complexity scaling with the number of user equipments (UEs). In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of different state-of-the-art TD and FD-DPD schemes in terms of complexity and linearization performance in both rich scattering and line-of-sight (LOS) channels and with antenna crosstalk. We propose a novel low-complexity FD convolutional neural network (CNN) DPD. We also propose a learning algorithm for any FD-DPDs with differentiable structure. The analysis shows that FD-DPD, particularly the proposed FD CNN, is preferable in LOS scenarios with few users, due to the favorable trade-off between complexity and linearization performance. On the other hand, in scenarios with more users or isotropic scattering channels, significant intermodulation distortions among UEs degrade FD-DPD performance, making TD-DPD more suitable. The proposed learning algorithm allows FD-DPDs to outperform TD-DPD optimized by indirect learning architecture under antenna crosstalk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The utilization of deep learning on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has brought the advanced accuracy and efficiency of cardiac healthcare diagnostics. By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning in semantic understanding, especially in feature extraction and representation learning, this study introduces a new multimodal contrastive pretaining framework that aims to improve the quality and robustness of learned representations of 12-lead ECG signals. Our framework comprises two key components, including Cardio Query Assistant (CQA) and ECG Semantics Integrator(ESI). CQA integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to leverage large language models (LLMs) and external medical knowledge to generate detailed textual descriptions of ECGs. The generated text is enriched with information about demographics and waveform patterns. ESI integrates both contrastive and captioning loss to pretrain ECG encoders for enhanced representations. We validate our approach through various downstream tasks, including arrhythmia detection and ECG-based subject identification. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines in these tasks. These baselines encompass supervised and self-supervised learning methods, as well as prior multimodal pretraining approaches.</description>

      <title>Urban Outdoor Propagation Measurements and Channel Models at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4-24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40-880 m propagation distance, encompassing 6 Line of Sight (LOS) and 14 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in PL model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values are obtained consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point data for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to supplement the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics evaluated here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</description>

Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items of each category within the pool. We study an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating the categories and rigorously characterize its performance, in both the noiseless and noisy settings. For the noiseless setting, we show that the AMP algorithm is equivalent to one recently proposed by El Alaoui et al. Our results provide a rigorous version of their performance guarantees, previously obtained via non-rigorous techniques. For the case of pooled data with two categories, known as quantitative group testing (QGT), we use the AMP guarantees to compute precise limiting values of the false positive rate and the false negative rate. Though the pooled data problem and QGT are both instances of estimation in a linear model, existing AMP theory cannot be directly applied since the design matrices are binary valued. The key technical ingredient in our analysis is a rigorous asymptotic characterization of AMP for generalized linear models defined via generalized white noise design matrices. This result, established using a recent universality result of Wang et al., is of independent interest. Our theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. For comparison, we propose estimators based on convex relaxation and iterative thresholding, without providing theoretical guarantees. The simulations indicate that AMP consistently outperforms these estimators.</description>
