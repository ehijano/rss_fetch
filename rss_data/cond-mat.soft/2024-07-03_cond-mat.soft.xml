      <title>Scale-dependent sharpening of interfacial fluctuations in shape-based models of dense cellular sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of tissue interfaces -- between separate populations of cells, or between a group of cells and its environment -- has attracted intense theoretical, computational, and experimental study. Recent work on shape-based models inspired by dense epithelia have suggested a possible ``topological sharpening'' effect, by which four-fold vertices spatially coordinated along a cellular interface lead to a cusp-like restoring force acting on cells at the interface, which in turn greatly suppresses interfacial fluctuations. We revisit these interfacial fluctuations, focusing on the distinction between short length scale reduction of interfacial fluctuations and long length scale renormalized surface tension. To do this, we implement a spectrally resolved analysis of fluctuations over extremely long simulation times. This leads to more quantitative information on the topological sharpening effect, in which the degree of sharpening depends on the length scale over which it is measured. We compare our findings with a Brownian bridge model of the interface, and close by analyzing existing experimental data in support of the role of short-length-scale topological sharpening effects in real biological systems.</description>

      <title>Active Polar Ring Polymer in Shear Flow -- An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the conformational and dynamical properties of semiflexible active polar ring polymers under linear shear flow. A ring is described as a continuous Gaussian polymer with a tangential active force of a constant density along its contour. The linear but non-Hermitian equation of motion is solved using an eigenfunction expansion, which yields activity-independent, but shear-rate-dependent, relaxation times and activity-dependent frequencies. As a consequence, the ring's stationary-state properties are independent of activity, and its conformations as well as rheological properties are equal to those of a passive ring under shear. The presence of characteristic time scales by the relaxation and the frequency gives rise to a particular dynamical behavior. A tank-treading-like motion emerges for large relaxation times and high frequencies, specifically for stiffer rings, governed by the activity-dependent frequencies. In the case of very flexible polymers, the relaxation behavior dominates over tank-treading. Shear strongly affects the crossover from a tank-treading to a relaxation-time dominated dynamics and suppresses tank-treading. This is reflected in the tumbling frequency, which exhibits two shear-rate dependent regimes, with an activity-dependent plateau at low shear rates followed by a power-law regime with increasing tumbling frequency for large shear rates.</description>

      <title>Birth, Death, and Horizontal Flight: Malthusian flocks with an easy plane in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I formulate the theory of three dimensional "Malthusian flocks" -- i.e., coherently moving collections of self-propelled entities (such as living creatures) which are being "born" and "dying" during their motion -- whose constituents all have a preference for having their velocity vectors lie parallel to the same two-dimensional plane. I determine the universal scaling exponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$, the "anisotropy" exponent $\zeta=3/4$, and the "roughness" exponent $\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.</description>

      <title>Linking microscopic structure to optical properties in soft plasmonic complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications. Yet, a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art numerical simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels drives NP-NP interactions, inducing NP progressive rearrangement with temperature. These results are directly compared to the extinction spectra of microgel-NPs complexes, allowing us to establish for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure.</description>

      <title>Policy-guided Monte Carlo on general state spaces: Application to glass-forming mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-guided Monte Carlo is an adaptive method to simulate classical interacting systems. It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising for instance both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.</description>

      <title>Manipulating liquid-liquid phase separation using patterned flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise control of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is the key to developing cutting-edge technologies that benefit diverse disciplines. Fluid flow was found to be capable of controlling the structure and effective temperature of LLPS, but the extent and precision of control were less than optimal. In this article, we propose that patterned flow can be employed as a generic tool to manipulate LLPS effectively. By combining theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that flows with tailor-made structures can become functional, allowing us to control diverse aspects of LLPS. Typical examples include the capture and pinning of droplets, fine-tuning of droplet sizes, forced assembly of periodic droplet arrays, and the remodeling of the kinetics and structure of phase separation. These manipulations are grounded on the redistribution of chemical potential by the structured flow. Our results not only can lead to potential LLPS-based technologies, but also highlight the rich behavior of LLPS introduced by the patterned flow.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of individual nanoparticles in cylindrical diatom frustule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diatoms are characterised by silica cell walls (frustules), which have highly ordered micro-/nano-structures. As the synthesis of such structures remains challenging, diatom frustules offer a promissing alternative to conventional porous particles in micro-/nano-engineering. In particular, for applications in drag deliverly systems, biosensors, and filters, an understanding of particle motion inside diatoms is of great impotance. In this study, we investigated nanoparticle (NP) motions inside diatom frustules using the single particle tracking (SPT) method. For these measruements, the diameter of the NP was about one-tenth smaller than that of the frustule. Inside the frustule, the diffusion motions of the NPs were suppressed, but this suppression was weakened near the exit of the frustule. Moreover, diffusion anisotropy between the axial and radial directions of the frustule was observed. This anisotropy is difficult to detect with ensemble methods; thus, the SPT method is a powerful approach for investigating NP motions in frustules.</description>

      <title>Active Loop Extrusion guides DNA-Protein Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial organization of DNA involves DNA loop extrusion and the formation of protein-DNA condensates. While the significance of each process is increasingly recognized, their interplay remains unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulation and theory we investigate this interplay. Our findings reveal that loop extrusion can enhance the dynamics of condensation and promotes coalescence and ripening of condensates. Further, the DNA loop enables condensate formation under DNA tension and position condensates. The concurrent presence of loop extrusion and condensate formation results in the formation of distinct domains similar to TADs, an outcome not achieved by either process alone.</description>

      <title>Crystallization and topology-induced dynamical heterogeneities in soft granular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft-granular media, such as dense emulsions, foams or tissues, exhibit either fluid- or solid-like properties depending on the applied external stresses. Whereas bulk rheology of such materials has been thoroughly investigated, the internal structural mechanics of finite soft-granular structures with free interfaces is still poorly understood. Here, we report the spontaneous `crystallization' and `melting' inside a model soft granular cluster -- a densely packed aggregate of $N\sim 30-40$ droplets engulfed by a fluid film -- subject to a varying external flow. We develop new machine learning tools to track the internal rearrangements in the quasi-2D cluster as it transits a sequence of constrictions. As the cluster relaxes from a state of strong mechanical deformations, we find differences in the dynamics of the grains within the interior of the cluster and those at its rim, with the latter experiencing larger deformations and less frequent rearrangements, effectively acting as an elastic membrane around a fluid-like core. We conclude that the observed structural-dynamical heterogeneity results from an interplay of the topological constrains, due to the presence of a closed interface, and the internal solid-fluid transitions. We discuss universality of such behavior in various types of finite soft granular structures, including biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening of dense suspensions of millimeter-sized particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work we have studied collectives of active disks with an energy depot, moving in the two-dimensional plane and interacting via excluded volume. The energy depot accounts for the extraction of energy taking place at the level of each particle in order to perform self-propulsion, included in an underdampled Langevin dynamics. We show that this model undergoes a flocking transition, exhibiting some of the key features of the Vicsek model, namely, band formation and giant number fluctuations. Large density bands disappear as the activity is further increased, eventually reaching a homogeneous polar state. We unravel an effective alignment interaction at the level of two-particle collisions that can be controlled by activity and gives rise to flocking at large scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate thermodynamic and structural quantities of a fluid of hard spheres of diameter $\sigma$ in a quasi-one-dimensional pore with accessible pore width $W $ smaller than $\sigma$ by applying a perturbative method worked out earlier for a confined fluid in a slit pore [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{109}, 240601 (2012)]. In a first step, we prove that the thermodynamic and a certain class of structural quantities of the hard-sphere fluid in the pore can be obtained from a purely one-dimensional fluid of rods of length $ \sigma$ with a central hard core of size $\sigma_W =\sqrt{\sigma^2 - W^2}$ and a soft part at both ends of length $(\sigma-\sigma_W)/2$. These rods interact via effective $k$-body potentials $v^{(k)}_\text{eff}$ ($k \geq 2$) . The two- and the three-body potential will be calculated explicitly. In a second step, the free energy of this effective one-dimensional fluid is calculated up to leading order in $ (W/\sigma)^2$. Explicit results for, e.g. the perpendicular pressure, surface tension, and the density profile as a function of density, temperature, and pore width are presented presented and partly compared with results from Monte-Carlo simulations and standard virial expansions. Despite the perturbative character of our approach it encompasses the singularity of the thermodynamic quantities at the jamming transition point.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>
