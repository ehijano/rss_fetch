      <title>Electron Beam Profiling via Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparency in Rubidium Vapor with Crossed Laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-optical detection approach to determine the position and spatial profile of an electron beam based on quantum properties of alkali metal atoms. To measure the electric field, produced by an electron beam, we excite thermal rubidium atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state via a two-photon ladder transition and detect Stark shifts of Rydberg states by monitoring frequencies of the corresponding electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) transmission peaks. We addressed several technical challenges in this approach. First, we use crossed laser beams to obtain spatial information about the electron beam position and geometry. Second, by pulsing the electron beam and using phase-sensitive optical detection, we separate the true electron beam electric signature from the parasitic electric fields due to photoelectric charges on the windows. Finally, we use a principle component analysis to further improve signal quality. We test this method to detect the current and to reconstruct a 2D profile of a 20 keV electron beam with currents ranging from 25 - 100 uA. While this technique provides less spatial resolution than fluorescence-based measurements, thanks to their speed and limited optical access requirements it can be useful for real-time non-invasive diagnostics of charged particle beams at accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Optical excitation and stabilization of ultracold field-linked tetratomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coherent optical population transfer of weakly bound field-linked (FL) tetratomic molecules (tetramers) to deeper FL bound states using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$+$\textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and photoassociation using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Magic wavelength at 477 nm for the strontium clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental measurement of a magic wavelength at 476.82362(8) nm for the 88Sr clock transition. The magic wavelength is determined through AC-Stark shift spectroscopy of atoms in an optical dipole trap. The value slightly deviates from the theoretical prediction by 0.061(54) nm. This magic wavelength, being shorter than the common one at 813 nm, will be important for applications such as Bragg pulses for matter-wave interferometry involving both clock states. This work also paves the way for quantum simulation with a shorter lattice.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>A hitchhiker's guide to nuclear polarization in muonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I consider the so-called nuclear polarization correction to the 1S-levels in light to intermediate muonic atoms. An easy to use recipe to compute it is given. The calculation includes the effect of the nucleon polarization, i.e. the contribution from inelastic states in the hadronic range, and Coulomb corrections beyond the leading logarithm approximation to both nuclear and nucleon polarization. I provide numerical estimates for $4\leq Z\leq41$, compare to the estimates in the literature and discuss the need for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Robust Two-Qubit Geometric Phase Gates using Amplitude and Frequency Ramping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>
