      <title>Quantifying the Benefit of Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the potential to change almost every line of work. As AI capabilities continue to improve in accuracy, robustness, and reach, AI may outperform and even replace human experts across many valuable tasks. Despite enormous effort devoted to understanding the impact of AI on labor and the economy and AI's recent successes in accelerating scientific discovery and progress, we lack a systematic understanding of how AI advances may benefit scientific research across disciplines and fields. Here, drawing from the literature on the future of work and the science of science, we develop a measurement framework to estimate both the direct use of AI and the potential benefit of AI in scientific research, applying natural language processing techniques to 74.6 million publications and 7.1 million patents. We find that the use of AI in research is widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015, and papers that use AI exhibit a citation premium, more likely to be highly cited both within and outside their disciplines. Moreover, our analysis reveals considerable potential for AI to benefit numerous scientific fields, yet a notable disconnect exists between AI education and its research applications, highlighting a mismatch between the supply of AI expertise and its demand in research. Lastly, we examine demographic disparities in AI's benefits across scientific disciplines and find that disciplines with a higher proportion of women or Black scientists tend to be associated with less benefit, suggesting that AI's growing impact on research may further exacerbate existing inequalities in science. As the connection between AI and scientific research deepens, our findings may become increasingly important, with implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Tree-structured Knowledge Graph For Academic Insight Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research surveys have always posed a challenge for beginner researchers who lack of research training. These researchers struggle to understand the directions within their research topic, and the discovery of new research findings within a short time. One way to provide intuitive assistance to beginner researchers is by offering relevant knowledge graphs(KG) and recommending related academic papers. However, existing navigation knowledge graphs primarily rely on keywords in the research field and often fail to present the logical hierarchy among multiple related papers clearly. Moreover, most recommendation systems for academic papers simply rely on high text similarity, which can leave researchers confused as to why a particular article is being recommended. They may lack of grasp important information about the insight connection between "Issue resolved" and "Issue finding" that they hope to obtain. To address these issues, this study aims to support research insight surveys for beginner researchers by establishing a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects the inheritance insight of research topics and the relevance insight among the academic papers.</description>

      <title>Detection of the papermilling behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of the data obtainable from the Web of Science publication and citation database, typical signs of possible papermilling behavior are described, quantified, and illustrated by examples. A MATLAB function is provided for the analysis of the outputs from the Web of Science. A new quantitative indicator -- integrity index, or I-index -- is proposed for using it along with standard bibliographic and scientometric indicators.</description>
