      <title>The Origin of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics. So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication). In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our narrative starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our metaphor is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <title>When climate variables improve the dengue forecasting: a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue is a viral vector-borne infectious disease that affects many countries worldwide, infecting around 390 million people per year. The main outbreaks occur in subtropical and tropical countries. We study here the influence of climate on dengue in Natal (2016-2019), Brazil, Iquitos (2001-2012), Peru, and Barranquilla (2011-2016), Colombia. For the analysis and simulations, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques, especially the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. In addition, regarding a feature in the ML technique, we analyze three possibilities: only dengue cases (D); climate and dengue cases (CD); humidity and dengue cases (HD). Depending on the city, our results show that the climate data can improve or not the forecast. For instance, for Natal, D induces a better forecast. For Iquitos, it is better to use CD. Nonetheless, for Barranquilla, the forecast is better, when we include cases and humidity data. For Natal, when we use more than 64\% and less than 80\% of the time series for training, we obtain results with correlation coefficients ($r$) among 0.917 and 0.949 and mean absolute errors (MAE) among 57.783 and 71.768 for the D case in forecasting. The optimal range for Iquitos is obtained when 79\% up to 88\% of the time series is considered for training. For this case, the best case is CD, having a minimum $r$ equal to 0.850 and maximum 0.887, while values of MAE oscillate among 2.780 and 4.156. For Barranquilla, the optimal range occurs between 72\% until 82\% of length training. In this case, the better approach is HD, where the measures exhibit a minimum $r$ equal to 0.942 and a maximum 0.953, while the minimum and maximum MAE vary between 6.085 and 6.669. We show that the forecast of dengue cases is a challenging problem and climate variables do not always help. However, when we include the mentioned climate variables, the most important one is humidity.</description>

      <title>Phases, morphologies, and transitions in a membrane model for the endoplasmic reticulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel model, comprising self-avoiding surfaces and incorporating edges and tubules, that is designed to characterize the structural morphologies and transitions observed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). By employing discretized models, we model smooth membranes with triangulated surfaces, and we utilize numerical variational methods to minimize energies associated with periodic morphologies. Our study obtains phases, their morphologies, and their transitions and examines their dependence on the membrane chemical potential, the line tensions, and the positive Gaussian curvature stiffness. By starting with diverse topological structures, we explore shape variations by using Surface Evolver, while maintaining fixed topology. Notably, we identify the region of parameter space where the model displays lamellae, with a lattice of helical edges connecting the layers; this resembles structures that have been observed in the rough ER. Furthermore, our investigation reveals an intricate phase diagram with periodic structures, including flat lamellar sheets, sponge phases, and configurations comprising tubules with junctions, which are akin to the morphology of the smooth ER. An estimation of lattice parameters is achieved through fluctuation analysis. Significantly, our model predicts a transition between homotopically equivalent lamellae, with helical edges and configurations featuring tubules with junctions.</description>

      <title>Does nematic order allow groups of elongated cells to sense electric fields better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective response to external directional cues like electric fields plays a pivotal role in processes such as tissue development, regeneration, and wound healing. In this study we focus on the impact of anisotropy in cell shape and local cell alignment on the collective response to electric fields. We model elongated cells that have a different accuracy sensing the field depending on their orientation with respect to the field. Elongated cells often line up with their long axes in the same direction - "nematic order" - does this help the group of cells sense the field more accurately? We use simulations of a simple model to show that if cells orient themselves perpendicular to their average velocity, alignment of a cell's long axis to its nearest neighbors' orientation can enhance the directional response to electric fields. However, for cells to benefit from aligning, their accuracy of sensing must be strongly dependent on cell orientation. We also show that cell-cell adhesion modulates the accuracy of cells in the group.</description>

      <title>Effect of active loop extrusion on the two-contact correlations in the interphase chromosome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population-averaged contact maps generated by the chromosome conformation capture technique provide important information about the average frequency of contact between pairs of chromatin loci as a function of the genetic distance between them. However, these datasets do not tell us anything about the joint statistics of simultaneous contacts between genomic loci in individual cells. This kind of statistical information can be extracted using the single-cell Hi-C method, which is capable of detecting a large fraction of simultaneous contacts within a single cell, as well as through modern methods of fluorescent labeling and super-resolution imaging. Motivated by the prospect of the imminent availability of relevant experimental data, in this work we theoretically model the joint statistics of pairs of contacts located along a line perpendicular to the main diagonal of the single-cell contact map. The analysis is performed within the framework of an ideal polymer model with quenched disorder of random loops, which, as previous studies have shown, allows to take into account the influence of the loop extrusion process on the conformational properties of interphase chromatin.</description>

      <title>A Lip Vibration Model Using Mechanical Properties of Flesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of the human lip between relaxed and fully contracted are not enough to explain the full range of professional brass players. Brass players manipulate their mouth cavity and vocal tract which act as Helmholtz resonators driving the lips. Brass players increase their upper ranges by reducing the amount of lip mass that vibrates using upstream or downstream techniques. In addition, it was found that the cup of the mouthpiece is a separate resonating cavity: not just an extension of the instrument funneling air down the length of tube. For the lowest three octaves of the range, the trombone does not act as a tube with a standing wave resonance, but as a transmission line responding to a string of pulses produced by the lips.</description>

      <title>Selecting active matter according to motility in an acoustofluidic setup: Self-propelled particles and sperm cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria, fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' -- are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own ''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap. This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting highly motile species or removing immotile species.</description>

      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>
