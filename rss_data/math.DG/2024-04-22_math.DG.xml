      <title>A gerbe-like construction in gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022 Baraglia and Konno showed the following: for a smooth family of a homotopy $K3$ surface $X \to \mathbb{X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} B$, if the tangent bundle along the fibers $T_B \mathbb{X}$ admits a spin structure, then $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ also admits a spin structure, where $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ is the vector bundle consisting of self-dual harmonic 2-forms. In this paper, we show that $T_B \mathbb{X} \oplus \pi^\ast \mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ admits a canonical spin structure. The proof is carried out by canonically constructing a lifting $O(1)$-gerbe for the spin structure on $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ using the families Seiberg--Witten equations, starting from a lifting $O(1)$-gerbe for the spin structure on $T_B \mathbb{X}$.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ricci solitons coming out of weakly PIC1 metric cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Deruelle-Schulze-Simon, we study complete weakly PIC1 Ricci flows with Euclidean volume growth coming out of metric cones. We show that such a Ricci flow must be an expanding gradient Ricci soliton, and as a consequence, any metric cone at infinity of a complete weakly PIC1 K\"ahler manifold with Euclidean volume growth is biholomorphic to complex Euclidean space in a canonical way.</description>

Abstract: We define a flexible class of Riemmanian metrics on the three-torus. Then, using Stern's inequality relating scalar curvature to harmonic one-forms, we show that any sequence of metrics in this family has a subsequence which converges to some flat metric on the torus in the sense of Dong-Song.</description>

      <title>Coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the coupled instanton equations for a metric, a spinor, a three-form, and a connection on a bundle, over a spin manifold. Special solutions in dimensions $6$ and $7$ arise, respectively, from the Hull--Strominger and heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$ systems. The equations are motivated by recent developments in theoretical physics and can be recast using generalized geometry; we investigate how coupled instantons relate to generalized Ricci-flat metrics and also to Killing spinors on a Courant algebroid. In this respect, we present two open questions regarding how these different geometric conditions are intertwined. A positive answer is expected from recent developments in the physics literature in work by De la Ossa, Larfors and Svanes, and in the mathematics literature, for the case of Calabi--Yau manifolds, in recent work by the second author jointly with Gonzalez Molina. We give a complete solution to the first of these two problems, for $\operatorname{G}_2$-structures with torsion coupled to $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons, in the seven-dimensional case, and also establish some partial results for the second problem. The last part of the present work carefully studies the approximate solutions to the heterotic $\operatorname{G}_2$-system constructed by the third and fourth authors on contact Calabi--Yau $7$-manifolds, for which we prove the existence of approximate coupled $\operatorname{G}_2$-instantons and generalized Ricci-flat metrics.</description>

      <title>Homogenization on parallelizable Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the homogenization limit of oscillating linear elliptic equations on an arbitrary parallelizable manifold $(M,g,\Gamma)$. We replicate the concept of two-scale convergence by pulling back tensors $T$ defined on the torus bundle $\mathbb{T}M$ to $M$. The process consist of two steps: localization in the slow variable through Voronoi domains, and inducing local periodicity in the fast variable from the local exponential map in combination with the geometry of the torus bundle. The procedure yields explicit cell formulae for the homogenization limit and as a byproduct a theory of two-scale convergence of tensors of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>The free elastic flow for closed planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that the an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

      <title>Laplace--Beltrami Equations and Numerical Conformal Mappings on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains. In this paper, the conjugate function method is extended to cover conformal mappings between Riemannian surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the connection between Laplace--Beltrami equations on surfaces and the computation of the conformal modulus of a quadrilateral. We consider mappings of simply, doubly, and multiply connected domains. The numerical computation is based on an $hp$-adaptive finite element method. The key advantage of our approach is that it allows highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry involving strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments including error estimates.</description>

      <title>Introducing spontaneous curvature to the Helfrich flow: Singularities and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there are various results on the long-time behavior of the Willmore flow, the Helfrich flow with non-zero spontaneous curvature as its natural generalization is not yet well-understood. Past results for the gradient flow of a locally area- and volume-constrained Willmore flow indicate the existence of finite-time singularities which corresponds to the scaling-behavior of the underlying energy. However, for a non-vanishing spontaneous curvature, the scaling behavior is not quite as conclusive.
  Indeed, in this article, we find that a negative spontaneous curvature corresponds to finite-time singularities of the locally constrained Helfrich flow if the initial surface is energetically close to a round sphere. Conversely however, in the case of a positive spontaneous curvature, we find a positive result in terms of the convergence behavior: The locally area-constrained Helfrich flow starting in a spherical immersion with suitably small Helfrich energy exists globally and converges to a Helfrich immersion after reparametrization. Moreover, this energetic smallness assumption is given by an explicit energy threshold depending on the spontaneous curvature and the local area constraint of the energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study $p$-biharmonic curves as a natural generalization of biharmonic curves. In contrast to biharmonic curves $p$-biharmonic curves do not need to have constant geodesic curvature if $p=\frac{1}{2}$ in which case their equation reduces to the one of $\frac{1}{2}$-elastic curves. We will classify $\frac{1}{2}$-biharmonic curves on closed surfaces and three-dimensional space forms making use of the results obtained for $\frac{1}{2}$-elastic curves from the literature. By making a connection to magnetic geodesic we are able to prove the existence of $\frac{1}{2}$-biharmonic curves on closed surfaces. In addition, we will discuss the stability of $p$-biharmonic curves with respect to normal variations. Our analysis highlights some interesting relations between $p$-biharmonic and $p$-elastic curves.</description>

This result stems from a new proof of the fact that a closed real-hyperbolic 4-manifold cannot support a complex structure. Finally, we construct infinitely many extended graph 4-manifolds with positive Euler characteristic which support almost complex structures.</description>

      <title>Dimension two holomorphic distributions on four-dimensional projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08901v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional holomorphic distributions on $\mathbb{P}^4$. We classify dimension two distributions, of degree at most $2$, with either locally free tangent sheaf or locally free conormal sheaf and whose singular scheme has pure dimension one. We show that the corresponding sheaves are split. Next, we investigate the geometry of such distributions, studying from maximally non-integrable to integrable distributions. In the maximally non-integrable case, we show that the distribution is either of Lorentzian type or a push-forward by a rational map of the Cartan prolongation of a singular contact structure on a weighted projective 3-fold. We study distributions of dimension two in $\mathbb{P}^4$ whose the conormal sheaves are the Horrocks-Mumford sheaves, describing the numerical invariants of their singular schemes which are smooth and connected. Such distributions are maximally non-integrable, uniquely determined by their singular schemes and invariant by a group $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5) \subset Sp(4, \mathbb{Q})$, where $H_5$ is the Heisenberg group of level $5$. We prove that the moduli spaces of Horrocks-Mumford distributions are irreducible quasi-projective varieties and we determine their dimensions. Finally, we observe that the space of codimension one distributions, of degree $d\geq 6$, on $\mathbb{P}^4$ have a family of degenerated flat holomorphic Riemannian metrics. Moreover, the degeneracy divisors of such metrics consist of codimension one distributions invariant by $H_5 \rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_5)$ and singular along a degenerate abelian surface with $(1,5)$-polarization and level-$5$-structure.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of diffeomorphisms groups of simplest Morse-Bott foliations on lens spaces, 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a Morse-Bott foliation on the solid torus $T=S^1\times D^2$ into $2$-tori parallel to the boundary and one singular central circle. Gluing two copies of $T$ by some diffeomorphism between their boundaries, one gets a lens space $L_{p,q}$ with a Morse-Bott foliation $\mathcal{F}_{p,q}$ obtained from $\mathcal{F}$ on each copy of $T$ and thus consisting of two singluar circles and parallel $2$-tori. In the previous paper [O. Khokliuk, S. Maksymenko, Journ. Homot. Rel. Struct., 2024, 18, 313-356] there were computed weak homotopy types of the groups $\mathcal{D}^{lp}(\mathcal{F}_{p,q})$ of leaf preserving (i.e. leaving invariant each leaf) diffeomorphisms of such foliations. In the present paper it is shown that the inclusion of these groups into the corresponding group $\mathcal{D}_{+}^{fol}(\mathcal{F}_{p,q})$ of foliated (i.e. sending leaves to leaves) diffeomorphisms which do not interchange singular circles are homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>When Leibniz Bialgebras are Nijenhuis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leibniz algebras can be seen as a "non-commutative" analogue of Lie algebras. Nijenhuis operators on Leibniz algebras introduced by Cari\~{n}ena, Grabowski, and Marmo in [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37(2004)] are (1, 1)-tensors with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion. Recently triangular Leibniz bialgebras were introduced by Tang and Sheng in [J. Noncommut. Geom. 16(2022)] via the twisting theory of twilled Leibniz algebras. In this paper we find that Leibniz algebras are very closely related to Nijenhuis operators, and prove that a triangular symplectic Leibniz bialgebra together with a dual triangular structure must possess Nijenhuis operators, which makes it possible to study the applications of Nijehhuis operators from the perspective of Leibniz algebras. At the same time, we regain the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation by using the tensor form of classical $r$-matrics. At last we give the classification of triangular Leibniz bialgebras of low dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>
