      <title>Unidirectional zero-index and omnidirectional hybrid hydrodynamic cloaks constructed from isotropic media with anisotropic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic cloaking offers a promising approach for manipulating viscous flows by redirecting fluid around an obstacle without inducing external disturbances. By extending pseudo-conformal mappings into potential flow models, we introduce a new isobaric boundary condition that enables the construction of zero-index cloaks using isotropic and homogeneous media shaped into anisotropic geometries, such as elliptical shells. Compared to conventional cloaks, which suffer performance degradation under realistic viscous conditions, the zero-index design significantly reduces such losses by suppressing flow disturbances at the inner boundary. To overcome practical limitations in realizing ideal isobaric conditions, we further propose a hybrid cloak that integrates a raised fluid domain with an auxiliary flow channel above the obstacle. This architecture removes the need for viscosity tuning and, under anisotropic geometries, surpasses both conventional and zero-index cloaks in omnidirectional performance. The design is validated through simulations and experiments. Our findings offer a generalizable strategy for controlling viscous flows and open new directions for microfluidic applications including drug delivery, particle steering, and cell sorting.</description>

      <title>Influence of ambient temperature on cavitation bubble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of ambient temperature on the dynamics of spark-generated cavitation bubbles over a broad temperature range of 23 to 90$^\circ \text{C}$. Increasing temperature, the attenuation of collapse intensity of a bubble in a free field is quantitatively characterised through the Rayleigh factor, minimum bubble volume, and maximum collapse velocity. In scenarios where the bubble is initiated near a rigid boundary, this temperature-dependent weakening effect manifests further as a reduction in jet velocity and bubble migration. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that when ambient temperature exceeds 70$^\circ \text{C}$, secondary cavitation forms near the bubble surface around the moment of maximum bubble expansion, followed by coalescence-induced surface wrinkles. These perturbations trigger Rayleigh-Taylor instability and enhance bubble fission. We determine the internal gas pressure of the bubble at its maximum expansion via the Rayleigh-Plesset equation with the input of bubble radius from experimental measurements. It reveals that the secondary cavitation is derived from the gas pressure descending below the saturated vapor pressure, which provides nucleation-favorable conditions. This study sheds light on the physics behind erosion mitigation in high-temperature fluids from the perspective of cavitation bubble dynamics.</description>

      <title>A marching cubes based method for topology changes in three-dimensional two-phase flows with front tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The handling of topology changes in two-phase flows, such as breakup or coalescence of interfaces, with front tracking is a well-known problem that requires an additional effort to perform explicit manipulations of the Lagrangian front. In this work, we present an approach that allows to perform topology changes with interfaces made of connected triangular elements. The methodology consists of replacing the fluid entities that undergo breakup/coalescence with the iso-surface corresponding to the indicator function value I = 0.5, which automatically returns the shape of the bodies after topology changes. The generation and triangulation of such surface is obtained by exploiting the marching cubes algorithm. Since we perform the reconstruction of the interface only for the bodies that experience breakup/coalescence, the increase in computational cost with respect to a classic front tracking scheme without topology changes is small. Using validation cases, we show that the proposed reconstruction procedure is second-order accurate for volume conservation and able to capture the physics of several two-phase flow configurations undergoing topology changes. The validation cases include the breakup of a droplet in simple shear flow and two rising bubbles in different regimes (peripheral and central breakups). Coalescence is tested by modelling the binary collision between two droplets. For the selected validation cases, an excellent agreement between the numerical results and experiments is observed. The proposed methodology is able to capture the details of such interfacial flows, by predicting accurately the coalescence/breakup dynamics, as well as the number, size and shapes of satellite droplets/bubbles after topology changes.</description>

      <title>Geometric and kinematic indicators of breaking inception in surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of breaking in surface gravity waves can be characterized by two distinct stages. Breaking onset, defined as the first visible surface manifestation of breaking, is preceded by breaking inception, which is characterized by the initiation of an irreversible process within the crest that leads inevitably to breaking. Breaking inception diagnostics formulated using the local energetic, kinematic and geometric properties of the wave crest have recently been proposed that appear to provide generic parametric threshold estimates and may facilitate the effect of wave breaking on larger scale processes to be parameterized. In a recent numerical study [McAllister et al, J. Fluid Mech. 974, A14 (2023)], a breaking inception diagnostic was proposed based on a threshold value for the maximum local interface angle \thetamax{}. We extend these findings to include surface tension effects, which are an inescapable feature of ocean surface waves and are known to have a non-negligible effect on wave geometry. We conduct a suite of numerical breaking wave packet simulations, which incorporate surface tension, to show that $\Theta_\textrm{th}=60^{\circ}$ is a robust threshold value for gravity waves of varying packet size, water depth and wind speed forcing. This value is twice the magnitude of that for waves in the absence of surface tension. We explore this result in the context of the kinematic inception parameter $B$ [Barthelemy et al, J. Fluid Mech. 841, 463 (2018)] and show that the kinematic and geometric methods are in fact equivalent and incorporate the same aspects of the underlying physical processes leading to wave breaking.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of intracycle angular velocity control applied to cross-flow turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate dynamics of cross-flow turbines (CFT) is critical to the improvement of performance and optimal control strategies. The current study numerically investigates intracycle control by modulating the angular velocity as a function of blade position for a 2-bladed NACA0018 turbine at a lab-scale chord-based Reynolds number of 45,000. Previous work has implemented intracycle control in attempts to improve turbine efficiency at the best performing tip-speed ratio (TSR). However, intracycle modulation of angular velocity simultaneously changes the time-averaged TSR, making it difficult to understand if the effects on performance are due to changes in mean TSR or imposed by the intracycle dynamics. Thus, this work explores a wider region of TSR across which intracycle control is applied, and assesses turbine performance with respect to time-averaged TSR. The effect of intracycle amplitude and phase shift of the velocity modulation is reported in terms of power generation and blade-level forces, and time-resolved flow fields reveal mechanisms behind changes in efficiency. For the 2-bladed turbine explored, the peak performance at constant angular velocity occurs at approximately TSR = 2. Intracycle control is found to be most beneficial at TSR &lt; 2 where power is increased up to 71% over its constant speed baseline and 12% over the peak performance without control. This is accomplished through boundary layer reattachment through the acceleration portion of the stroke. In contrast, applying control when TSR $\ge 2$ is not beneficial due to degraded performance in the downstream portion of the stroke.</description>

      <title>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</description>

      <title>Predicting The Evolution of Interfaces with Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in AI has established neural operators as powerful tools that can predict the evolution of partial differential equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Some complex problems rely on sophisticated algorithms to deal with strong discontinuities in the computational domain. For example, liquid-vapour multiphase flows are a challenging problem in many configurations, particularly those involving large density gradients or phase change. The complexity mentioned above has not allowed for fine control of fast industrial processes or applications because computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models do not have a quick enough forecasting ability. This work demonstrates that the time scale of neural operators-based predictions is comparable to the time scale of multi-phase applications, thus proving they can be used to control processes that require fast response. Neural Operators can be trained using experimental data, simulations or a combination. In the following, neural operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, and the resulting predictions showed very high accuracy, particularly in predicting the evolution of the liquid-vapour interface, one of the most critical tasks in a multi-phase process controller.</description>

      <title>Simulating non-Brownian suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interactions are commonly modeled using no-slip boundary conditions. However, small deviations from these conditions can significantly alter the dynamics of suspensions and particles, especially at the micro and nano scales. This work presents a robust implicit numerical method for simulating non-colloidal suspensions with non-homogeneous Navier slip boundary conditions. Our approach is based on a regularized boundary integral formulation, enabling accurate and efficient computation of hydrodynamic interactions. This makes the method well-suited for large-scale simulations. We validate the method by comparing computed drag forces on homogeneous and Janus particles with analytical results. Additionally, we consider the effective viscosity of suspensions with varying slip lengths, benchmarking against available analytical no-slip and partial-slip theories.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of 3D Rayleigh-Benard Convection with Equivariant Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems -- governed by partial differential equations -- present unique challenges regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels. As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. Our results demonstrate significant gains both in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better scaling to more complex dynamics, that is, larger Rayleigh numbers. The accompanying code is available under https://github.com/FynnFromme/equivariant-rb-forecasting.</description>

      <title>Role of Friction on the Formation of Confined Granular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable systems of fluidized grains can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material. A diagram was obtained for the settled particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. For the lower friction values, we find that the number of defects is smaller, the contact chains being longer and aligned. Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.</description>

      <title>Oil slicks dynamics in semi-confined geometries in the presence of water waves: analytical and numerical insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have shown previously that the dynamics of isolated oil slicks on the water's surface after spills is significantly influenced by surface-wave motion practically at the onset of the spreading process. In this work, we draw our attention to another practical scenario of the oil slick's behaviour in semi-confined geometries under the action of surface waves and in the presence of oil leakage source. We hypothesize that the geometric constraints should qualitatively change the oil layer response to the wave motion leading to localization of oil spill domains even at modest levels of the surface-wave perturbations. Several realistic cases were rigorously explored, with special attention paid to the interplay, the combined effect of the two factors, oil influx and wave motion. It was demonstrated quantitatively how the spreading process can be either facilitated or suppressed leading to potential confinement.</description>

      <title>The role of interior dynamics and differentiation on the surface and atmosphere of lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics.
  Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean.
  In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.</description>
