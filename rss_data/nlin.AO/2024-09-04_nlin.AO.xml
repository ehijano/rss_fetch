      <title>Swarm Systems as a Platform for Open-Ended Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial swarm systems have been extensively studied and used in computer science, robotics, engineering and other technological fields, primarily as a platform for implementing robust distributed systems to achieve pre-defined objectives. However, such swarm systems, especially heterogeneous ones, can also be utilized as an ideal platform for creating *open-ended evolutionary dynamics* that do not converge toward pre-defined goals but keep exploring diverse possibilities and generating novel outputs indefinitely. In this article, we review Swarm Chemistry and its variants as concrete sample cases to illustrate beneficial characteristics of heterogeneous swarm systems, including the cardinality leap of design spaces, multiscale structures/behaviors and their diversity, and robust self-organization, self-repair and ecological interactions of emergent patterns, all of which serve as the driving forces for open-ended evolutionary processes. Applications to science, engineering, and art/entertainment as well as the directions of further research are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherence resonance in influencer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex networks are abundant in nature and many share an important structural property: they contain a few nodes that are abnormally highly connected (hubs). Some of these hubs are called influencers because they couple strongly to the network and play fundamental dynamical and structural roles. Strikingly, despite the abundance of networks with influencers, little is known about their response to stochastic forcing. Here, for oscillatory dynamics on influencer networks, we show that subjecting influencers to an optimal intensity of noise can result in enhanced network synchronization. This new network dynamical effect, which we call coherence resonance in influencer networks, emerges from a synergy between network structure and stochasticity and is highly nonlinear, vanishing when the noise is too weak or too strong. Our results reveal that the influencer backbone can sharply increase the dynamical response in complex systems of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Complete Synchronization of Coupled Oscillators Based on the Contraction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies contraction theory with the aim of exploring complete synchronization phenomenon in complex networks of coupled oscillators. We examine the conditions for complete synchronization in three network topologies: all-to-all, star, and ring. Specifically, we derive the conditions under which networks of linearly coupled (Duffing) van der Pol oscillators achieve complete synchronization. Additionally, by combining contraction theory with the trapping region method, we identify the conditions for complete synchronization of networks of linearly coupled Rayleigh van der Pol oscillators under specific initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Network inference from oscillatory signals based on circle map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous in nature, which is mathematically described by coupled oscillators. Synchronization strongly depends on the interaction network, and the network plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics. To understand and control synchronization dynamics in the real world, it is essential to identify the network from the observed data. While previous studies have developed the methods for inferring the network of asynchronous systems, it remains challenging to infer the network of well-synchronized oscillators. In this study, we develop a method for non-invasively inferring the network of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators. This method is based on the circle map, which describes the phase change in an oscillatory cycle. Our method discards a large part of data used for inference, which may seem counterintuitive. However, the effectiveness of the method is supported by the phase reduction theory, a well-established theory for analyzing weakly coupled oscillators. We verify the proposed method by applying it to simulated data of the limit-cycle oscillators. This study provides an important step towards understanding synchronization in real-world systems from a network perspective.</description>

      <title>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity --the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.</description>

      <title>Controlling noise with self-organized resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological systems often consist of a small number of constituents and are therefore inherently noisy. To function effectively, these systems must employ mechanisms to constrain the accumulation of noise. Such mechanisms have been extensively studied and comprise the constraint by external forces, nonlinear interactions, or the resetting of the system to a predefined state. Here, we propose a fourth paradigm for noise constraint: self-organized resetting, where the resetting rate and position emerge from self-organization through time-discrete interactions. We study general properties of self-organized resetting systems using the paradigmatic example of cooperative resetting, where random pairs of Brownian particles are reset to their respective average. We demonstrate that such systems undergo a delocalization phase transition, separating regimes of constrained and unconstrained noise accumulation. Additionally, we show that systems with self-organized resetting can adapt to external forces and optimize search behavior for reaching target values. Self-organized resetting has various applications in nature and technology, which we demonstrate in the context of sexual interactions in fungi and spatial dispersion in shared mobility services. This work opens routes into the application of self-organized resetting across various systems in biology and technology.</description>

      <title>Networks with many structural scales: a Renormalization Group perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance profoundly influences the dynamics and structure of complex systems, spanning from critical phenomena to network architecture. Here, we propose a precise definition of scale-invariant networks by leveraging the concept of a constant entropy loss rate across scales in a renormalization-group coarse-graining setting. This framework enables us to differentiate between scale-free and scale-invariant networks, revealing distinct characteristics within each class. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive inventory of genuinely scale-invariant networks, both natural and artificially constructed, demonstrating, e.g., that the human connectome exhibits notable features of scale invariance. Our findings open new avenues for exploring the scale-invariant structural properties crucial in biological and socio-technological systems.</description>

      <title>Solving the prisoner's dilemma trap in Hamilton's model of temporarily formed random groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining the evolution of cooperation in the strong altruism scenario, where a cooperator does not benefit from her contribution to the public goods, is a challenging problem that requires positive assortment among cooperators (i.e., cooperators must tend to associate with other cooperators) or punishment of defectors. The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a group selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by Hamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in a population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that strong altruism evolves in Hamilton's original model in the case of biparental sexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the amplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the only stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to the `problem of origination' of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take off from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible reassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may even be favored in situations where the prisoner's dilemma applies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of An Information Theoretic Analog of Two Masses on a Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short communication we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston's free energy principle in the theory of learning in a system of agents. Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization "out of the box". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.</description>
