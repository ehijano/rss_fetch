      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following problem: maximize the amplitude $|x_t|$ at time $t$, over all complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of arbitrary homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the characteristic roots in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any triple $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained with coinciding roots on the boundary circle; in particular, this implies that the peak amplitude $\sup_{t \ge n} |x_t|$ can be maximized explicitly, by studying a unique equation with the characteristic polynomial $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the cophase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. We propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>The nonhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation on families of open Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the nonhomogeneous Beltrami equation to give an optimal solution to the nonhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation for continuous or smooth families of complex structures and $(0,1)$-forms of a H\"older class on a smooth open orientable surface. As an application, we obtain the Oka-Grauert principle for complex line bundles on families of open Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Boundary behavior of functions in the Schur-Agler class of the polydisc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a generalization of the notion of a Hilbert space model of a function $\varphi$ in the Schur-Agler class of the polydisc. This generalization is well adapted to the investigation of boundary behavior of $\varphi$ at a mild singularity $\tau$ on the $d$-torus. We prove the existence of a generalized model with an enhanced continuity property at such a singularity $\tau$. We use this result to prove the directional differentiability of a function $\varphi$ in the Schur-Agler class at a singular point on the $d$-torus for which the Carath\'eodory condition holds and to calculate the corresponding directional derivative. The results of this paper extend to the polydisc $\mathbb{D}^d$ results of Agler, McCarthy, Tully-Doyle and Young which generalized to the bidisc the classical Julia-Wolff-Carath\'{e}odory theorem about analytic self-maps of $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>Weighted Kernel Functions on Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the variation of weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernels on planar domains as a function of the weight. A Ramadanov type theorem is shown to hold as the weights vary. As a consequence, we derive properties of the zeros of the weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernel for weights close to the constant function $1$ on the boundary. We further study the weighted Ahlfors map and strengthen results concerning its boundary behaviour. Explicit examples of the weighted kernels are presented for certain classes of weights. We highlight an interesting property of the weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernels, implicit in Nehari's work, and explore several of its consequences. Finally, we discuss the weighted Carath\'eodory metric, and describe relations of the weighted Szeg\H{o} and Garabedian kernel with certain classical kernel functions.</description>

      <title>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems.
  In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions.
  The circular Dyson Brownian motions is a typical example of stochastic log-gas. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>K-differentials with prescribed singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local invariants that a meromorphic $k$-differential on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 0$ can have for $k \geq 3$. These local invariants include the orders of zeros and poles, as well as the $k$-residues at the poles. We show that for a given pattern of orders of zeros, there exists, with a few exceptions, a primitive holomorphic $k$-differential having zeros of these orders. In the meromorphic case, for genus $g \geq 1$, every expected tuple appears as a configuration of $k$-residues. On the other hand, for certain strata in genus zero, finitely many tuples (up to simultaneous scaling) do not occur as configurations of $k$-residues for a $k$-differential.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"{a}hler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study MRC fibrations of compact K\"ahler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature. We first prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold is rationally connected if its tangent bundle is BC-$p$ positive for all $1\leq p\leq \dim X$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature must be rationally connected, and generalize a result of Heier-Wong and Yang to the conformally K\"ahler case. The second result concern structure theorems for two immediate curvature conditions. We prove that, a compact K\"ahler manifold with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature or semi-positive $k$-scalar curvature, either the rational dimension $\geq n-k+1$ or the universal cover is biholomorphic and isometric to the product of $\mathbb{C}^m\times F$ for some rationally connected manifold $F$.</description>

      <title>The Rhaly Operators on K\"othe Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Rhaly operator on K\"othe spaces, with a primary focus on understanding its well-definedness, continuity, and compactness. We especially examine operators acting on power series spaces of both infinite and finite type. In the sequel, we provide integral representations for the Rhaly operator on the space of entire functions $H(\mathbb{C})$ and the space of holomorphic functions on the unit disc $H(\mathbb{D})$. We also investigate the topologizability and power boundedness of the Rhaly operators, which leads to findings about their mean ergodicity, uniform mean ergodicity, and Ces\`aro boundedness.</description>
