      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>XtalOpt Version 13: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Search for Novel Functional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Version 13 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XtalOpt website, https://xtalopt.github.io. In the new version of the XtalOpt code, a general platform for multi-objective global optimization is implemented. This functionality is designed to facilitate the search for (meta)stable phases of functional materials through minimization of the enthalpy of a crystalline system coupled with the simultaneous optimization of any desired properties that are specified by the user. The code is also able to perform a constrained search by filtering the parent pool of structures based on a user-specified feature, while optimizing multiple objectives. Here, we present the implementation and various technical details, and we provide a brief overview of additional improvements that have been introduced in the new version of XtalOpt.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising quantum information platforms but are susceptible to magnetic noise. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near nanostructured lossy material components essential in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum sensing and computing, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise for enhancing spin qubit quantum sensing and computing performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. We further apply our theoretical framework to control noise effects in realistic quantum computing devices and quantum sensing applications. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Features of the Fourth Order Irreducible Correlations in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding high-order correlations or multi-particle entities in a many-body system is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics, but also critical for many technological applications. So far, higher-order multi-particle irreducible correlations in semiconductors have not been studied beyond the second-order or two-particle case. In this paper, we study the correlation of two electrons and two holes (2e2h) using the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation (4B-BSE) and applied to the calculation of the helicity-resolved absorption between the two-body and four-body states for a monolayer MoTe2. Surprisingly, we found a rich series of spectral peaks within an energy span of ~40 meV below the exciton that has not been seen before. To understand the origin of the new spectral peaks, the Feynman diagrams of the 4B BSE are recast into the cluster expansion formalism, allowing us to study the individual effects of selected clusters or correlations of various orders. We found that the irreducible clusters of orders up to the 3rd and their factorized combinations cannot explain the spectral features. Importantly, we found that the 4th order irreducible correlation is necessary and sufficient to explain the new features. The 4th order irreducible correlation corresponds to a four-particle irreducible cluster involving two electrons and two holes, alternatively called quadron or quadruplon. The new 4th order correlation or four-particle entity not only enriches our understanding of many-body correlations but also could provide new mechanism for light emission or absorption for possible new optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the {\em numerical sheet breakup} effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Entanglement through the Lens of Quantum Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum information analysis of vibrational wave functions to understand complex vibrational spectra of molecules with strong anharmonic couplings and vibrational resonances. For this purpose, we define one- and two-modal entropies to guide the identification of strongly coupled vibrational modes and to characterize correlations within modal basis sets. We evaluate these descriptors for multi-configurational vibrational wave functions which we calculate with the n-mode vibrational density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Based on the quantum information measures, we present a vibrational entanglement analysis of the vibrational ground and excited states of CO2, which display strong anharmonic effects due to the symmetry-induced and accidental (near-) degeneracies. We investigate the entanglement signature of the Fermi resonance and discuss the maximally entangled state arising from the two degenerate bending modes.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Backpropagation Through Time to Learn Complex Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Of all the vector fields surrounding the minima of recurrent learning setups, the gradient field with its exploding and vanishing updates appears a poor choice for optimization, offering little beyond efficient computability. We seek to improve this suboptimal practice in the context of physics simulations, where backpropagating feedback through many unrolled time steps is considered crucial to acquiring temporally coherent behavior. The alternative vector field we propose follows from two principles: physics simulators, unlike neural networks, have a balanced gradient flow, and certain modifications to the backpropagation pass leave the positions of the original minima unchanged. As any modification of backpropagation decouples forward and backward pass, the rotation-free character of the gradient field is lost. Therefore, we discuss the negative implications of using such a rotational vector field for optimization and how to counteract them. Our final procedure is easily implementable via a sequence of gradient stopping and component-wise comparison operations, which do not negatively affect scalability. Our experiments on three control problems show that especially as we increase the complexity of each task, the unbalanced updates from the gradient can no longer provide the precise control signals necessary while our method still solves the tasks.

      <title>Performance Analysis of an Optimization Algorithm for Metamaterial Design on the Integrated High-Performance Computing and Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing metamaterials with complex geometries is a big challenge. Although an active learning algorithm, combining machine learning (ML), quantum computing, and optical simulation, has emerged as an efficient optimization tool, it still faces difficulties in optimizing complex structures that have potentially high performance. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the performance of an optimization algorithm for metamaterial design on the integrated HPC and quantum systems. We demonstrate significant time advantages through message-passing interface (MPI) parallelization on the high-performance computing (HPC) system showing approximately 54% faster ML tasks and 67 times faster optical simulation against serial workloads. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of a quantum algorithm designed for optimization, which runs with various quantum simulators on a local computer or HPC-quantum system. Results showcase ~24 times speedup when executing the optimization algorithm on the HPC-quantum hybrid system. This study paves a way to optimize complex metamaterials using the integrated HPC-quantum system.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Rubidium-Assisted Electron Capture by Barium (II) Cation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-local energy transfer between bound electronic states close to the ionisation threshold is employed for efficient state preparation in dilute atom systems from technological foundations to quantum computing. The generalisation to electronic transitions into and out of the continuum is lacking quantum simulations necessary to motivate such potential experiments. Here, we present the first development of a electron-dynamical model simulating fully three-dimensional atomic systems for this purpose. We investigate the viability of this model for the prototypical case of recombination of ultracold barium(II) by environment-assisted electron capture thanks to a rubidium atom in its vicinity. Both atomic sites are modelled as effective one-electron systems using the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm and can transfer energy by dipole-dipole interaction. We find that the simulations are robust enough to realise assisted capture over a dilute interatomic distance which we are able to quantify by comparing to simulations without interatomic energy exchange. For our current parameters not yet optimised for reaction likelihood, an environment-ionising assisted capture has a probability of $1.9\times10^{-5}~\%$ over the first $15~\mathrm{fs}$ of the simulation. The environment-exciting assisted-capture path to $[\text{Ba}^{+*}\text{Rb}^{*}]$ appears as a stable long-lived intermediate state with a probability of $8.2\times10^{-4}~\%$ for at least $20~\mathrm{fs}$ after the capture has been completed. This model shows potential to predict optimised parameters as well as to accommodate the conditions present in experimental systems as closely as possible. We put the presented setup forward as a suitable first step to experimentally realise environment-assisted electron capture with current existing technologies.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of intrinsic geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>

      <title>Go Green: Selected Configuration Interaction as a More Sustainable Alternative for High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new distributed implementation of the full configuration interaction (FCI) method has been reported [Gao et al. J. Chem Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 1185]. Thanks to a hybrid parallelization scheme, the authors were able to compute the exact energy of propane (\ce{C3H8}) in the minimal basis STO-3G. This formidable task involves handling an active space of 26 electrons in 23 orbitals or a Hilbert space of \SI{1.3d12} determinants. This is, by far, the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Here, we illustrate how, from a general point of view, selected configuration interaction (SCI) can achieve microhartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational and memory cost, via a sparse exploration of the FCI space. The present SCI calculations are performed with the \textit{Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively} (CIPSI) algorithm, as implemented in a determinant-driven way in the \textsc{quantum package} software. The present study reinforces the common wisdom that among the exponentially large number of determinants in the FCI space, only a tiny fraction of them significantly contribute to the energy. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of achieving comparable accuracy using more reasonable and sustainable computational resources, hence reducing the ever-growing carbon footprint of computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them e.g., as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>
