      <title>Discontinuity-preserving Normal Integration with Auxiliary Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many surface reconstruction methods incorporate normal integration, which is a process to obtain a depth map from surface gradients. In this process, the input may represent a surface with discontinuities, e.g., due to self-occlusion. To reconstruct an accurate depth map from the input normal map, hidden surface gradients occurring from the jumps must be handled. To model these jumps correctly, we design a novel discretization scheme for the domain of normal integration. Our key idea is to introduce auxiliary edges, which bridge between piecewise-smooth patches in the domain so that the magnitude of hidden jumps can be explicitly expressed. Using the auxiliary edges, we design a novel algorithm to optimize the discontinuity and the depth map from the input normal map. Our method optimizes discontinuities by using a combination of iterative re-weighted least squares and iterative filtering of the jump magnitudes on auxiliary edges to provide strong sparsity regularization. Compared to previous discontinuity-preserving normal integration methods, which model the magnitudes of jumps only implicitly, our method reconstructs subtle discontinuities accurately thanks to our explicit representation of jumps allowing for strong sparsity regularization.</description>

      <title>iSeg: Interactive 3D Segmentation via Interactive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present iSeg, a new interactive technique for segmenting 3D shapes. Previous works have focused mainly on leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models for 3D segmentation based on text. However, text may be insufficient for accurately describing fine-grained spatial segmentations. Moreover, achieving a consistent 3D segmentation using a 2D model is challenging since occluded areas of the same semantic region may not be visible together from any 2D view. Thus, we design a segmentation method conditioned on fine user clicks, which operates entirely in 3D. Our system accepts user clicks directly on the shape's surface, indicating the inclusion or exclusion of regions from the desired shape partition. To accommodate various click settings, we propose a novel interactive attention module capable of processing different numbers and types of clicks, enabling the training of a single unified interactive segmentation model. We apply iSeg to a myriad of shapes from different domains, demonstrating its versatility and faithfulness to the user's specifications.

      <title>LCM-Lookahead for Encoder-based Text-to-Image Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have introduced fast sampling methods that can effectively produce high-quality images in just one or a few denoising steps. Interestingly, when these are distilled from existing diffusion models, they often maintain alignment with the original model, retaining similar outputs for similar prompts and seeds. These properties present opportunities to leverage fast sampling methods as a shortcut-mechanism, using them to create a preview of denoised outputs through which we can backpropagate image-space losses. In this work, we explore the potential of using such shortcut-mechanisms to guide the personalization of text-to-image models to specific facial identities. We focus on encoder-based personalization approaches, and demonstrate that by tuning them with a lookahead identity loss, we can achieve higher identity fidelity, without sacrificing layout diversity or prompt alignment. We further explore the use of attention sharing mechanisms and consistent data generation for the task of personalization, and find that encoder training can benefit from both.</description>

      <title>NEMTO: Neural Environment Matting for Novel View and Relighting Synthesis of Transparent Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose NEMTO, the first end-to-end neural rendering pipeline to model 3D transparent objects with complex geometry and unknown indices of refraction. Commonly used appearance modeling such as the Disney BSDF model cannot accurately address this challenging problem due to the complex light paths bending through refractions and the strong dependency of surface appearance on illumination. With 2D images of the transparent object as input, our method is capable of high-quality novel view and relighting synthesis. We leverage implicit Signed Distance Functions (SDF) to model the object geometry and propose a refraction-aware ray bending network to model the effects of light refraction within the object. Our ray bending network is more tolerant to geometric inaccuracies than traditional physically-based methods for rendering transparent objects. We provide extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate our high-quality synthesis and the applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Learning Subject-Aware Cropping by Outpainting Professional Photos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to frame (or crop) a photo often depends on the image subject and its context; e.g., a human portrait. Recent works have defined the subject-aware image cropping task as a nuanced and practical version of image cropping. We propose a weakly-supervised approach (GenCrop) to learn what makes a high-quality, subject-aware crop from professional stock images. Unlike supervised prior work, GenCrop requires no new manual annotations beyond the existing stock image collection. The key challenge in learning from this data, however, is that the images are already cropped and we do not know what regions were removed. Our insight is to combine a library of stock images with a modern, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The stock image collection provides diversity and its images serve as pseudo-labels for a good crop, while the text-image diffusion model is used to out-paint (i.e., outward inpainting) realistic uncropped images. Using this procedure, we are able to automatically generate a large dataset of cropped-uncropped training pairs to train a cropping model. Despite being weakly-supervised, GenCrop is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods and significantly better than comparable weakly-supervised baselines on quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>An Error-Bounded Lossy Compression Method with Bit-Adaptive Quantization for Particle Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents error-bounded lossy compression tailored for particle datasets from diverse scientific applications in cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion energy sciences. As today's high-performance computing capabilities advance, these datasets often reach trillions of points, posing significant visualization, analysis, and storage challenges. While error-bounded lossy compression makes it possible to represent floating-point values with strict pointwise accuracy guarantees, the lack of correlations in particle data's storage ordering often limits the compression ratio. Inspired by quantization-encoding schemes in SZ lossy compressors, we dynamically determine the number of bits to encode particles of the dataset to increase the compression ratio. Specifically, we utilize a k-d tree to partition particles into subregions and generate ``bit boxes'' centered at particles for each subregion to encode their positions. These bit boxes ensure error control while reducing the bit count used for compression. We comprehensively evaluate our method against state-of-the-art compressors on cosmology, fluid dynamics, and fusion plasma datasets.</description>
