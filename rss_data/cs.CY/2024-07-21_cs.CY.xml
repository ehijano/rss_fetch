      <title>Social Capital and Persistence in Computer Science of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a lucrative and growing field, low levels of gender and racial diversity in CS remain prevalent. Education and workforce support programs with the intention to promote underrepresented students' persistence in CS exist, which teach skills, inform of career options, and grow students' network in CS. Studies demonstrate these programs' effectiveness as it relates to changes in affective outcomes, such as participants' confidence in CS skills and attitudes towards CS jobs. However, programs' longitudinal impact on participants' build-up of social capital in CS, and the resulting social capital's influence on their persistence in CS, remain unexplored. Motivated by the literature that associates demographic identifiers with access to social capital, and students' access to developmental relationships and career resources (social capital) in CS with their persistence, this study explores a CS support program's impact on persistence through capital building. We focus on Google's CSSI, which provided graduating high school students with a 3-week-long introduction to CS. We use interviews with participants who are now 2-5 years out of the program to study CSSI's impact on their social capital and long-term CS persistence. Thematic analysis reveals three program elements that influenced students' build-up of social capital, and that the resulting persistence was realized through students' progress towards internships and goals for paying-it-forward in CS. These findings inform our recommendations that future support programs and educational settings consider mentorship centered on socioemotional support, opportunities for collaboration, and time for fun social activities. Additional suggestions center on engaging socially-oriented individuals with CS support programs. These insights inform CS educators on design choices that can encourage the persistence of underrepresented students in CS.</description>

      <title>Report on the Conference on Ethical and Responsible Design in the National AI Institutes: A Summary of Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2023, the Georgia Tech Ethics, Technology, and Human Interaction Center organized the Conference on Ethical and Responsible Design in the National AI Institutes. Representatives from the National AI Research Institutes that had been established as of January 2023 were invited to attend; researchers representing 14 Institutes attended and participated. The conference focused on three questions: What are the main challenges that the National AI Institutes are facing with regard to the responsible design of AI systems? What are promising lines of inquiry to address these challenges? What are possible points of collaboration? Over the course of the conference, a revised version of the first question became a focal point: What are the challenges that the Institutes face in identifying ethical and responsible design practices and in implementing them in the AI development process? This document summarizes the challenges that representatives from the Institutes in attendance highlighted.</description>

      <title>"We're not all construction workers": Algorithmic Compression of Latinidad on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latinx diaspora in the United States is a rapidly growing and complex demographic who face intersectional harms and marginalizations in sociotechnical systems and are currently underserved in CSCW research. While the field understands that algorithms and digital content are experienced differently by marginalized populations, more investigation is needed about how Latinx people experience social media and, in particular, visual media. In this paper, we focus on how Latinx people experience the algorithmic system of the video-sharing platform TikTok. Through a bilingual interview and visual elicitation study of 19 Latinx TikTok users and 59 survey participants, we explore how Latinx individuals experience TikTok and its Latinx content. We find Latinx TikTok users actively use platform affordances to create positive and affirming identity content feeds, but these feeds are interrupted by negative content (i.e. violence, stereotypes, linguistic assumptions) due to platform affordances that have unique consequences for Latinx diaspora users. We discuss these implications on Latinx identity and representation, introduce the concept of \textit{algorithmic identity compression}, where sociotechncial systems simplify, flatten, and conflate intersection identities, resulting in compression via the loss of critical cultural data deemed unnecessary by these systems and designers of them. This study explores how Latinx individuals are particularly vulnerable to this in sociotechnical systems, such as, but not limited to, TikTok.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy AI: A Review of Ethical and Robust Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) could transform many fields, but their fast development creates significant challenges for oversight, ethical creation, and building user trust. This comprehensive review looks at key trust issues in LLMs, such as unintended harms, lack of transparency, vulnerability to attacks, alignment with human values, and environmental impact. Many obstacles can undermine user trust, including societal biases, opaque decision-making, potential for misuse, and the challenges of rapidly evolving technology. Addressing these trust gaps is critical as LLMs become more common in sensitive areas like finance, healthcare, education, and policy. To tackle these issues, we suggest combining ethical oversight, industry accountability, regulation, and public involvement. AI development norms should be reshaped, incentives aligned, and ethics integrated throughout the machine learning process, which requires close collaboration across technology, ethics, law, policy, and other fields. Our review contributes a robust framework to assess trust in LLMs and analyzes the complex trust dynamics in depth. We provide contextualized guidelines and standards for responsibly developing and deploying these powerful AI systems. This review identifies key limitations and challenges in creating trustworthy AI. By addressing these issues, we aim to build a transparent, accountable AI ecosystem that benefits society while minimizing risks. Our findings provide valuable guidance for researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders striving to establish trust in LLMs and ensure they are used responsibly across various applications for the good of society.</description>

      <title>Harmful Suicide Content Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmful suicide content on the Internet is a significant risk factor inducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors among vulnerable populations. Despite global efforts, existing resources are insufficient, specifically in high-risk regions like the Republic of Korea. Current research mainly focuses on understanding negative effects of such content or suicide risk in individuals, rather than on automatically detecting the harmfulness of content. To fill this gap, we introduce a harmful suicide content detection task for classifying online suicide content into five harmfulness levels. We develop a multi-modal benchmark and a task description document in collaboration with medical professionals, and leverage large language models (LLMs) to explore efficient methods for moderating such content. Our contributions include proposing a novel detection task, a multi-modal Korean benchmark with expert annotations, and suggesting strategies using LLMs to detect illegal and harmful content. Owing to the potential harm involved, we publicize our implementations and benchmark, incorporating an ethical verification process.</description>

      <title>Using Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Collective Intelligence: Policy Synth and Smarter Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era characterized by rapid societal changes and complex challenges, institutions' traditional methods of problem-solving in the public sector are increasingly proving inadequate. In this study, we present an innovative and effective model for how institutions can use artificial intelligence to enable groups of people to generate effective solutions to urgent problems more efficiently. We describe a proven collective intelligence method, called Smarter Crowdsourcing, which is designed to channel the collective intelligence of those with expertise about a problem into actionable solutions through crowdsourcing. Then we introduce Policy Synth, an innovative toolkit which leverages AI to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing problem-solving approach both more scalable, more effective and more efficient. Policy Synth is crafted using a human-centric approach, recognizing that AI is a tool to enhance human intelligence and creativity, not replace it. Based on a real-world case study comparing the results of expert crowdsourcing alone with expert sourcing supported by Policy Synth AI agents, we conclude that Smarter Crowdsourcing with Policy Synth presents an effective model for integrating the collective wisdom of human experts and the computational power of AI to enhance and scale up public problem-solving processes. While many existing approaches view AI as a tool to make crowdsourcing and deliberative processes better and more efficient, Policy Synth goes a step further, recognizing that AI can also be used to synthesize the findings from engagements together with research to develop evidence-based solutions and policies. The study offers practical tools and insights for institutions looking to engage communities effectively in addressing urgent societal challenges.</description>

      <title>Honest Computing: Achieving demonstrable data lineage and provenance for driving data and process-sensitive policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data is the foundation of any scientific, industrial or commercial process. Its journey typically flows from collection to transport, storage, management and processing. While best practices and regulations guide data management and protection, recent events have underscored its vulnerability. Academic research and commercial data handling have been marred by scandals, revealing the brittleness of data management. Data, despite its importance, is susceptible to undue disclosures, leaks, losses, manipulation, or fabrication. These incidents often occur without visibility or accountability, necessitating a systematic structure for safe, honest, and auditable data management. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Honest Computing as the practice and approach that emphasizes transparency, integrity, and ethical behaviour within the realm of computing and technology. It ensures that computer systems and software operate honestly and reliably without hidden agendas, biases, or unethical practices. It enables privacy and confidentiality of data and code by design and by default. We also introduce a reference framework to achieve demonstrable data lineage and provenance, contrasting it with Secure Computing, a related but differently-orientated form of computing. At its core, Honest Computing leverages Trustless Computing, Confidential Computing, Distributed Computing, Cryptography and AAA security concepts. Honest Computing opens new ways of creating technology-based processes and workflows which permit the migration of regulatory frameworks for data protection from principle-based approaches to rule-based ones. Addressing use cases in many fields, from AI model protection and ethical layering to digital currency formation for finance and banking, trading, and healthcare, this foundational layer approach can help define new standards for appropriate data custody and processing.</description>

      <title>Undermining Mental Proof: How AI Can Make Cooperation Harder by Making Thinking Easier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models and other highly capable AI systems ease the burdens of deciding what to say or do, but this very ease can undermine the effectiveness of our actions in social contexts. We explain this apparent tension by introducing the integrative theoretical concept of "mental proof," which occurs when observable actions are used to certify unobservable mental facts. From hiring to dating, mental proofs enable people to credibly communicate values, intentions, states of knowledge, and other private features of their minds to one another in low-trust environments where honesty cannot be easily enforced. Drawing on results from economics, theoretical biology, and computer science, we describe the core theoretical mechanisms that enable people to effect mental proofs. An analysis of these mechanisms clarifies when and how artificial intelligence can make low-trust cooperation harder despite making thinking easier.</description>

      <title>RDBE: Reasoning Distillation-Based Evaluation Enhances Automatic Essay Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, various encoder-only and encoder-decoder pre-trained models like BERT and T5 have been applied to automatic essay scoring (AES) as small language models. However, existing studies have primarily treated this task akin to a classification problem, focusing solely on outputting scores in the target text without offering interpretations for the generated scores. Departing from the approaches, we introduce Reasoning Distillation-Based Evaluation (RDBE), which integrates interpretability to elucidate the rationale behind model scores while enhancing performance through initial reasoning. This interpretive capability is acquired during training by leveraging generated reasoning from a large language model (LLM) to distill a small language model (SLM). Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RDBE across all scoring rubrics considered in the dataset. RDBE outperforms both zero-shot LLM generation and generation from a baseline fine-tuned model, establishing itself as state-of-the-art in the corresponding dataset. This highlights its practical interpretative output and enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>User-Creator Feature Dynamics in Recommender Systems with Dual Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems present relevant contents to users and help content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems influences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the items they are recommended, while creators are incentivized to alter their contents such that it is recommended more frequently. We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influences of recommender systems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both theoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and promoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ recommendation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system.</description>

      <title>Urban Visual Appeal According to ChatGPT: Contrasting AI and Human Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visual appeal of urban environments significantly impacts residents' satisfaction with their living spaces and their overall mood, which in turn, affects their health and well-being. Given the resource-intensive nature of gathering evaluations on urban visual appeal through surveys or inquiries from residents, there is a constant quest for automated solutions to streamline this process and support spatial planning. In this study, we applied an off-the-shelf AI model to automate the analysis of urban visual appeal, using over 1,800 Google Street View images of Helsinki, Finland. By incorporating the GPT-4 model with specified criteria, we assessed these images. Simultaneously, 24 participants were asked to rate the images. Our results demonstrated a strong alignment between GPT-4 and participant ratings, although geographic disparities were noted. Specifically, GPT-4 showed a preference for suburban areas with significant greenery, contrasting with participants who found these areas less appealing. Conversely, in the city centre and densely populated urban regions of Helsinki, GPT-4 assigned lower visual appeal scores than participant ratings. While there was general agreement between AI and human assessments across various locations, GPT-4 struggled to incorporate contextual nuances into its ratings, unlike participants, who considered both context and features of the urban environment. The study suggests that leveraging AI models like GPT-4 allows spatial planners to gather insights into the visual appeal of different areas efficiently, aiding decisions that enhance residents' and travellers' satisfaction and mental health. Although AI models provide valuable insights, human perspectives are essential for a comprehensive understanding of urban visual appeal. This will ensure that planning and design decisions promote healthy living environments effectively.</description>

      <title>LLMs left, right, and center: Assessing GPT's capabilities to label political bias from web domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates whether OpenAI's GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model, can accurately classify the political bias of news sources based solely on their URLs. Given the subjective nature of political labels, third-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news source diversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these human ratings on a seven-degree scale ("far-left" to "far-right"). The analysis compares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for website popularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation ($\text{Spearman's } \rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p &lt; 0.001$) between GPT-4's and MBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4 abstained from classifying approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset, particularly less popular and less biased sources. The study also identifies a slight leftward skew in GPT-4's classifications compared to MBFC's. The analysis suggests that while GPT-4 can be a scalable, cost-effective tool for political bias classification of news websites, but its use should complement human judgment to mitigate biases. Further research is recommended to explore the model's performance across different settings, languages, and additional datasets.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Empirical Evidence of the GDPR (In-)Effectiveness: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of data protection, a striking disconnect prevails between traditional domains of doctrinal, legal, theoretical, and policy-based inquiries and a burgeoning body of empirical evidence. Much of the scholarly and regulatory discourse remains entrenched in abstract legal principles or normative frameworks, leaving the empirical landscape uncharted or minimally engaged. Since the birth of EU data protection law, a modest body of empirical evidence has been generated but remains widely scattered and unexamined. Such evidence offers vital insights into the perception, impact, clarity, and effects of data protection measures but languishes on the periphery, inadequately integrated into the broader conversation. To make a meaningful connection, we conduct a comprehensive review and synthesis of empirical research spanning nearly three decades (1995- March 2022), advocating for a more robust integration of empirical evidence into the evaluation and review of the GDPR, while laying a methodological foundation for future empirical research.</description>

      <title>The Files are in the Computer: On Copyright, Memorization, and Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The New York Times's copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft alleges OpenAI's GPT models have "memorized" NYT articles. Other lawsuits make similar claims. But parties, courts, and scholars disagree on what memorization is, whether it is taking place, and what its copyright implications are. These debates are clouded by ambiguities over the nature of "memorization." We attempt to bring clarity to the conversation. We draw on the technical literature to provide a firm foundation for legal discussions, providing a precise definition of memorization: a model has "memorized" a piece of training data when (1) it is possible to reconstruct from the model (2) a near-exact copy of (3) a substantial portion of (4) that piece of training data. We distinguish memorization from "extraction" (user intentionally causes a model to generate a near-exact copy), from "regurgitation" (model generates a near-exact copy, regardless of user intentions), and from "reconstruction" (the near-exact copy can be obtained from the model by any means). Several consequences follow. (1) Not all learning is memorization. (2) Memorization occurs when a model is trained; regurgitation is a symptom not its cause. (3) A model that has memorized training data is a "copy" of that training data in the sense used by copyright. (4) A model is not like a VCR or other general-purpose copying technology; it is better at generating some types of outputs (possibly regurgitated ones) than others. (5) Memorization is not a phenomenon caused by "adversarial" users bent on extraction; it is latent in the model itself. (6) The amount of training data that a model memorizes is a consequence of choices made in training. (7) Whether or not a model that has memorized actually regurgitates depends on overall system design. In a very real sense, memorized training data is in the model--to quote Zoolander, the files are in the computer.</description>

      <title>Auditing for Racial Discrimination in the Delivery of Education Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00591</link>

Abstract: Digital ads on social-media platforms play an important role in shaping access to economic opportunities. Our work proposes and implements a new third-party auditing method that can evaluate racial bias in the delivery of ads for education opportunities. Third-party auditing is important because it allows external parties to demonstrate presence or absence of bias in social-media algorithms. Education is a domain with legal protections against discrimination and concerns of racial-targeting, but bias induced by ad delivery algorithms has not been previously explored in this domain. Prior audits demonstrated discrimination in platforms' delivery of ads to users for housing and employment ads. These audit findings supported legal action that prompted Meta to change their ad-delivery algorithms to reduce bias, but only in the domains of housing, employment, and credit. In this work, we propose a new methodology that allows us to measure racial discrimination in a platform's ad delivery algorithms for education ads. We apply our method to Meta using ads for real schools and observe the results of delivery. We find evidence of racial discrimination in Meta's algorithmic delivery of ads for education opportunities, posing legal and ethical concerns. Our results extend evidence of algorithmic discrimination to the education domain, showing that current bias mitigation mechanisms are narrow in scope, and suggesting a broader role for third-party auditing of social media in areas where ensuring non-discrimination is important.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of European Data and AI Regulations for Automotive Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11271</link>

Abstract: This report summarizes the European Union's series of data and AI regulations and analyzes them for managers in automotive vehicle manufacturing organizations. In particular, we highlight the relevant ideas of the regulations, including how they find their roots in earlier legislation, how they contradict and complement each other, as well as the business opportunities that these regulations offer. The structure of the report is as follows. First, we address the GDPR as the cornerstone against which the requirements of other regulations are weighed and legislated. Second, we explain the EU Data Act since it directly addresses Internet of Things (IoT) for businesses in the private sector and imposes strict requirements on large data generators such as vehicle manufacturers. For manufacturers, compliance with the EU Data Act is a prerequisite for the subsequent legislation, in particular the EU AI Act. Third, we explain the Data Governance Act, Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and EU AI Act in chronological order. Overall, we characterize European Union data regulations as a wave set, rooted in historical precedent, with important implications for the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Towards Responsible Development of Generative AI for Education: An Evaluation-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.</description>

      <title>From Principles to Practices: Lessons Learned from Applying Partnership on AI's (PAI) Synthetic Media Framework to 11 Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13025</link>

Abstract: 2023 was the year the world woke up to generative AI, and 2024 is the year policymakers are responding more firmly. Importantly, this policy momentum is taking place alongside real world creation and distribution of synthetic media. Social media platforms, news organizations, dating apps, image generation companies, and more are already navigating a world of AI-generated visuals and sounds, already changing hearts and minds, as policymakers try to catch up. How, then, can AI governance capture the complexity of the synthetic media landscape? How can it attend to synthetic media's myriad uses, ranging from storytelling to privacy preservation, to deception, fraud, and defamation, taking into account the many stakeholders involved in its development, creation, and distribution? And what might it mean to govern synthetic media in a manner that upholds the truth while bolstering freedom of expression? What follows is the first known collection of diverse examples of the implementation of synthetic media governance that responds to these questions, specifically through Partnership on AI's (PAI) Responsible Practices for Synthetic Media - a voluntary, normative Framework for creating, distributing, and building technology for synthetic media responsibly, launched in February 2023. In this paper, we present a case bank of real world examples that help operationalize the Framework - highlighting areas synthetic media governance can be applied, augmented, expanded, and refined for use, in practice. Read together, the cases emphasize distinct elements of AI policymaking and seven emergent best practices supporting transparency, safety, expression, and digital dignity online: consent, disclosure, and differentiation between harmful and creative use cases.</description>

      <title>MoralBERT: A Fine-Tuned Language Model for Capturing Moral Values in Social Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moral values play a fundamental role in how we evaluate information, make decisions, and form judgements around important social issues. Controversial topics, including vaccination, abortion, racism, and sexual orientation, often elicit opinions and attitudes that are not solely based on evidence but rather reflect moral worldviews. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) show that moral values can be gauged in human-generated textual content. Building on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), this paper introduces MoralBERT, a range of language representation models fine-tuned to capture moral sentiment in social discourse. We describe a framework for both aggregated and domain-adversarial training on multiple heterogeneous MFT human-annotated datasets sourced from Twitter (now X), Reddit, and Facebook that broaden textual content diversity in terms of social media audience interests, content presentation and style, and spreading patterns. We show that the proposed framework achieves an average F1 score that is between 11% and 32% higher than lexicon-based approaches, Word2Vec embeddings, and zero-shot classification with large language models such as GPT-4 for in-domain inference. Domain-adversarial training yields better out-of domain predictions than aggregate training while achieving comparable performance to zero-shot learning. Our approach contributes to annotation-free and effective morality learning, and provides useful insights towards a more comprehensive understanding of moral narratives in controversial social debates using NLP.</description>

      <title>Debiasing surgeon: fantastic weights and how to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays an ever-growing concerning phenomenon, the emergence of algorithmic biases that can lead to unfair models, emerges. Several debiasing approaches have been proposed in the realm of deep learning, employing more or less sophisticated approaches to discourage these models from massively employing these biases. However, a question emerges: is this extra complexity really necessary? Is a vanilla-trained model already embodying some ``unbiased sub-networks'' that can be used in isolation and propose a solution without relying on the algorithmic biases? In this work, we show that such a sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model without requiring additional training. We further validate that such specific architecture is incapable of learning a specific bias, suggesting that there are possible architectural countermeasures to the problem of biases in deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>FairEM360: A Suite for Responsible Entity Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity matching is one the earliest tasks that occur in the big data pipeline and is alarmingly exposed to unintentional biases that affect the quality of data. Identifying and mitigating the biases that exist in the data or are introduced by the matcher at this stage can contribute to promoting fairness in downstream tasks. This demonstration showcases FairEM360, a framework for 1) auditing the output of entity matchers across a wide range of fairness measures and paradigms, 2) providing potential explanations for the underlying reasons for unfairness, and 3) providing resolutions for the unfairness issues through an exploratory process with human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing an ensemble of matchers. We aspire for FairEM360 to contribute to the prioritization of fairness as a key consideration in the evaluation of EM pipelines.</description>

      <title>The Impact of School and Family Networks on COVID-19 Infections Among Dutch Students: A Study Using Population-Level Registry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of different social interactions is key to improving epidemic models. Here, we use extensive registry data -- including PCR test results and population-level networks -- to investigate the impact of school, family, and other social contacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the Netherlands (June 2020--October 2021). We isolate and compare different contexts of potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission by matching pairs of students based on their attendance at the same or different primary school (in 2020) and secondary school (in 2021) and their geographic proximity. We then calculated the probability of temporally associated infections -- i.e. the probability of both students testing positive within a 14-day period.
  Our results highlight the relative importance of household and family transmission in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to school settings. The probability of temporally associated infections for siblings and parent-child pairs living in the same household was 22.6--23.2\%, and 4.7--7.9\% for family members living in different household. In contrast, the probability of temporally associated infections was 0.52\% for pairs of students living nearby but not attending the same primary or secondary school, 0.66\% for pairs attending different secondary schools but having attended the same primary school, and 1.65\% for pairs attending the same secondary school. Finally, we used multilevel regression analyses to examine how individual, school, and geographic factors contribute to transmission risk. We found that the largest differences in transmission probabilities were due to unobserved individual (60\%) and school-level (34\%) factors. Only a small proportion (3\%) could be attributed to geographic proximity of students or to school size, denomination, or the median income of the school area.</description>

      <title>Are you still on track!? Catching LLM Task Drift with Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00799v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely used in retrieval-augmented applications to orchestrate tasks and process inputs from users and other sources. These inputs, even in a single LLM interaction, can come from a variety of sources, of varying trustworthiness and provenance. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM receives and acts upon instructions from supposedly data-only sources, thus deviating from the user's original instructions. We define this as task drift, and we propose to catch it by scanning and analyzing the LLM's activations. We compare the LLM's activations before and after processing the external input in order to detect whether this input caused instruction drift. We develop two probing methods and find that simply using a linear classifier can detect drift with near perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We show that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Our setup does not require any modification of the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning) or any text generation, thus maximizing deployability and cost efficiency and avoiding reliance on unreliable model output. To foster future research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we will release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, comprising a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from 5 SoTA language models, and inspection tools.</description>
