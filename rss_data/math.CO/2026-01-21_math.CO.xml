      <title>Greedily Constructing Small Quasi-Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a digraph $D$,a quasi-kernel is an independent set $Q$ such that for every vertex $u$, there is a vertex $v \in Q$ satisfying $\text{dist}(v,u)\leq 2$. In 1974 Chv\'atal and Lov\'asz showed every digraph contains a quasi-kernel. In 1976, P. L. Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely conjectured that every sourceless digraph has a quasi-kernel of order at most $\frac{n}{2}$. Despite significant recent attention by the community the problem remains far from solved, with no bound of the form $(1-\epsilon)n$ known. We introduce a polynomial time algorithm which greedily constructs a small quasi-kernel. Using this algorithm we show that if $D$ is a $\vec{K}_{1,d}$-free digraph, then $D$ has a quasi-kernel of order at most $\frac{(d^2 - 2d + 2)n}{d^2-d+1}$. By refining this argument we prove that for any $D$ with maximum out-degree $3$ this algorithm constructs a quasi-kernel of order at most ${4n}/{7}$. Finally, we consider the problem in digraphs forbidding certain orientation of short cycles as subgraphs, concluding that all orientations $D$ of a graph $G$ with girth at least $7$ have a quasi-kernel of order at most $\frac{(d^2+4)n}{(d+2)^2}$, where $d$ is the maximum out-degree of $D$.</description>

      <title>On the eigenvalues of cyclic covers of Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covering graphs of the Paley graph associated to a finite field of characteristic p in the case where the covering transformation group is cyclic of prime order distinct from p. When the field has q = p elements, we show that the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix determine the graph isomorphism class among translation invariant covers. When q = p^r &gt; p, we construct examples of cospectral covering graphs that are not isomorphic as graphs.</description>

      <title>The Inverse Symplectic Eigenvalue Problem of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic geometry plays an increasingly important role in mathematics, physics and applications, and naturally gives rise to interesting matrix families and properties. One of these is the notion of symplectic eigenvalues, whose existence for positive definite matrices is known as Williamson's theorem or decomposition. This notion of symplectic eigenvalues gives rise to inverse problems. We introduce the inverse symplectic eigenvalue problem for positive definite matrices described by a labeled graph and solve it for several families of labeled graphs and all labeled graphs of order four. To solve these problems we develop various tools such as the Strong Symplectic Spectral Property (SSSP) and its consequences such as the Supergraph Theorem, the Bifurcation Theorem, and the Matrix Liberation Lemma for symplectic eigenvalues, graph couplings to describe collections of labelings of a graph that produce the same symplectic eigenvalues, and coupled graph zero forcing. We establish numerous results for symplectic positive definite matrices, including a sharp lower bound on the number of nonzero entries of such a matrix (or equivalently, the number of edges in its graph). This lower bound is a consequence of a lower bound on the sum of number of nonzero entries in an irreducible positive definite matrix and its inverse.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional $p$-Normed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Tutte's integer flows and the $d$-dimensional Euclidean flows of Mattiolo, Mazzuoccolo, Rajn\'{i}k, and Tabarelli to \emph{$d$-dimensional $p$-normed nowhere-zero flows} and define the corresponding flow index $\phi_{d,p}(G)$ to be the infimum over all real numbers $r$ for which $G$ admits a $d$-dimensional $p$-normed nowhere-zero $r$-flow. For any bridgeless graph $G$ and any $p\ge 1$, we establish general upper bounds, including $\phi_{2,p}(G) \le 3$, $\phi_{3,p}(G) \le 1+\sqrt{2}$, and tight bounds for graphs admitting a $4$-NZF. For graphs with oriented $(k+1)$-cycle $2l$-covers, we show that $\phi_{k,p}(G) = 2$, which implies $\phi_{2,p}(G) = 2$ for graphs admitting a nowhere-zero $3$-flow and $\phi_{3,p}(G) = 2$ for those admitting a nowhere-zero $4$-flow. These results extend classical flow theory to arbitrary norms, provide supporting evidences for Tutte's $5$-flow Conjecture and Jain's $S^2$-Flow Conjecture, and connect combinatorial flows with geometric and topological perspectives.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan polar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a construction of minimal codes arising from a family of almost Ramanujan graphs was shown. Ramanujan graphs are examples of expander graphs that minimize the second-largest eigenvalue of their adjacency matrix. We call such graphs Ramanujan, since all known non-trivial constructions imply the Ramanujan conjecture on arithmetical functions. In this paper, we prove that some families of tangent graphs of finite classical polar spaces satisfy Ramanujan's condition. If the polarity is unitary, or it is orthogonal and the quadric is over the binary field, the tangent graphs are strongly regular, and we know their spectrum. By direct computation, it is possible to show which families of tangent graphs are Ramanujan.</description>

      <title>Bruhat Intervals in the Infinite Symmetric Group are Cohen-Macaulay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the (non-Noetherian) Stanley-Reisner ring of the order complex of certain intervals in the Bruhat order on the infinite symmetric group $S_\infty$ of all auto-bijections of $\mathbb{N}$ is Cohen-Macaulay in the sense of ideals and weak Bourbaki unmixed. This gives an infinite-dimensional version of results due to Edelman, Bj\"{o}rner, and Kind and Kleinschmidt for finite symmetric groups $S_n$.</description>

      <title>Paley-type matrices and $1$-factorizations of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ball, Ortega--Moreno, and Prodromou asked whether, for every odd prime $p$, one can find a $1$-factor of the complete graph $K_{p+1}$ with some arithmetic restrictions related to quadratic residues. This problem is motivated by $1$-factorizations that are compatible with the sign pattern of certain Paley-type matrices. Recently, Afifurrahman et al. made some partial progress. In this paper, we completely resolve the problem.</description>

      <title>Level of Faces for Exponential Sequence of Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the bivariate exponential generating function $F_l(x,y)$ for the number of level-$l$ faces of an exponential sequence of arrangements (ESA), and establish the formula $F_l(x,y)=\big(F_1(x,y)\big)^l$ with a combinatorial interpretation. Its specialization at $x=0$ recovers a result first obtained by Chen et al. [3,4] for certain classic ESAs and later generalized to all ESAs by Southerland et al. [8]. As a byproduct, we obtain that an alternating sum of the number of level-$l$ faces is invariant with respect to the choice of ESA, and is exactly the Stirling number of the second kind. We also extend the binomial-basis expansion theorem [3,4,14] and Stanley's formula on ESAs [9] from characteristic polynomials to Whitney polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any two sets of reals numbers $A=\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$ and $B=\{b_1,\dots,b_n\}$, the sums of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,b_{\pi(i)}$ always take on $\Omega(n^{3})$ distinct values, as we range over all permutations $\pi \in S_n$.
  An important ingredient is a ``supportive'' version of Hal\'asz's anticoncentration theorem from Littlewood-Offord theory, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Even Sets and Dual Projective Geometric Codes: A Tale of Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the smallest even sets in ${\rm PG}(n,q)$, i.e. sets that intersect every line in an even number of points, are cylinders with a hyperoval as base. This fits into a more general study of dual projective geometric codes. Let $q$ be a prime power, and define $\mathcal C_k(n,q)^\perp$ as the kernel of the $k$-space vs. point incidence matrix of ${\rm PG}(n,q)$, seen as a matrix over the prime order subfield of $\mathbb F_q$. Determining the minimum weight of this linear code is still an open problem in general, but has been reduced to the case $k=1$. There is a known construction that constructs small weight codewords of $\mathcal C_1(n,q)^\perp$ from minimum weight codewords of $\mathcal C_1(2,q)^\perp$. We call such codewords cylinder codewords. We pose the conjecture that all minimum weight codewords of $\mathcal C_1(n,q)^\perp$ are cylinder codewords. This conjecture is known to be true if $q$ is prime. We take three steps towards proving that the conjecture is true in general:
  (1) We prove that the conjecture is true if $q$ is even. This is equivalent to our classification of the smallest even sets.
  (2) We prove that the minimum weight of $\mathcal C_1(n,q)^\perp$ is $q^{n-2}$ times the minimum weight of $\mathcal C_1(2,q)^\perp$, which matches the weight of cylinder codewords. Thus, we completely reduce the problem of determining the minimum weight of $\mathcal C_1(n,q)^\perp$ to the case $n=2$.
  (3) We prove that if the conjecture is true for $n=3$, it is true in general.</description>

      <title>Extending graph total colorings to cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $2\le k\in\mathbb{Z}$. A total coloring of a simple connected regular graph via color set $ \{0,1,\ldots, k\}$ is said to be {\it efficient} if each color yields an efficient dominating set, where the efficient domination condition applies to the restriction of each color class to the vertex set. In this work, focus is set upon 2-cell complexes whose 1-skeletons, namely their induced 1-cell complexes, are toroidal graphs. Each such 2-cell complex is said to cover its induced 1-skeleton. An efficient total coloring of one such skeleton induces an efficient total cell coloring of its covering 2-cell complex if it assigns a vertex-and-edge $k$-color set to the border skeleton of each of its 2-cells, with the consequently missing color in $\{0,1,\ldots,k\}$ assigned to the 2-cell itself, so that the two adjacent 2-cells along any 1-cell are assigned different colors. Applications are given for plane tilings, cycle products, toroidal triangulations, honeycombs and star-of-David tilings.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding walk, connective constant, cubic graph, Fisher transformation, quasi-transitive graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on infinite quasi-transitive cubic graphs under \emph{local transformations} that replace each degree-$3$ vertex by a finite, symmetric three-port gadget. To each gadget we associate a two-port SAW generating function $g(x)$, defined by counting SAWs that enter and exit the gadget through prescribed ports. Our first main result shows that, if $G$ is cubic and $G_1=\phi(G)$ is obtained by applying the local transformation at every vertex, then the connective constants $\mu(G)$ and $\mu(G_1)$ satisfy the functional relation \[ \mu(G)^{-1}=g\bigl(\mu(G_1)^{-1}\bigr). \] We next consider critical exponents defined via susceptibility-type series that do not rely on an ambient Euclidean dimension, and prove that the exponents $\gamma$ and $\eta$ are invariant under local transformations; moreover $\nu$ is invariant under a standard regularity hypothesis on SAW counts (a common slowly varying function).
  Our second set of results concerns bipartite graphs, where the local transformation is applied to one colour class (or to both classes, possibly with different gadgets). In this setting we obtain an analogous relation \[ \mu(G)^{-2}=h\bigl(\mu(G_{\mathrm e})^{-1}\bigr), \] with $h(x)=xg(x)$ when only one class is transformed and $h(x)=g_{\phi_1}(x)\,g_{\phi_2}(x)$ when both are transformed. We further present explicit families of examples, including replacing each degree-3 vertex by a complete-graph gadget $K_N$.</description>

      <title>L(3,2,1)-labelings of three classes of 4-valent circulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $L(3,2,1)$-labeling of a graph $G$ is an assignment $f$ of nonnegative integers to vertices such that $\vert f(x)-f(y)\vert &gt; 3-\mbox{dist}_G(x,y)$ for every pair $x,y$ of vertices of $G$, where $\mbox{dist}_G(x,y)$ denotes the distance between $x$ and $y$ in $G$. The minimum span (i.e., the difference between the largest and the smallest value) among all $L(3,2,1)$-labelings of $G$ is denoted by $\lambda_{(3,2,1)}(G)$. In this paper, we study $L(3,2,1)$-labelings of three classes of circulant graphs. Namely, we investigate $\lambda_{(3,2,1)}$ of $C_n(\{1,s_2,n-s_2,n-1\})$, where $s_2\in\{3,4,5\}$. This paper is a continuation of a recent publication of T. Calamoneri who studied the square of cycles, i.e., circulants $C_n(\{1,2,n-2,n-1\})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-parameter family of binomial-convolution operators acting on sequences. These operators form an additive semigroup with an explicit inverse, and they subsume iterated classical binomial transforms as a special case. We describe the action in terms of ordinary and exponential generating functions, interpret the transform in the Riordan-array framework, and prove a general root-shift principle for constant-coefficient linear recurrences: applying the transform shifts the characteristic roots by a fixed amount. Several classical families (Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, Jacobsthal, Mersenne) are treated uniformly as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart quasi-polynomials via Barnes polynomials and discrete moments of parallelepipeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give novel and explicit formulas for the Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of rational simple polytopes, in terms of Barnes polynomials and discrete moments of half-open parallelepipeds. These formulas also hold for all positive dilations of a rational polytope. There is an interesting appearance of an extra complex z-parameter, which seems to allow for more compact formulations. We also give similar formulas for discrete moments of rational polytopes, and their positive dilates, objects known in the literature as sums of polynomials over a polytope. The appearance of the Barnes polynomials and the Barnes numbers allow for explicit computations. From this work, it is clear that the complexity of computing Ehrhart quasi-polynomials lies mainly in the computation of various discrete moments of parallelepipeds. These discrete moments are in general summed over a particular lattice flow on a closed torus, defined in this paper. Some of the consequences involve novel vanishing identities for rational polytopes, novel formulations of Ehrhart polynomials of unimodular polytopes, and a differential equation that extends the work of Eva Linke.</description>

      <title>An Eventown Result for Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of permutations $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is even-cycle-intersecting if $\sigma \pi^{-1}$ has an even cycle for all $\sigma,\pi \in \mathcal{F}$. We show that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq S_n$ is an even-cycle-intersecting family of permutations, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq 2^{n-1}$, and that equality holds when $n$ is a power of 2 and $\mathcal{F}$ is a double-translate of a Sylow 2-subgroup of $S_n$. This result can be seen as an analogue of the classical eventown problem for subsets and it confirms a conjecture of J\'anos K\"orner on maximum reversing families of the symmetric group. Along the way, we show that the canonically intersecting families of $S_n$ are also the extremal odd-cycle-intersecting families of $S_n$ for all even $n$. While the latter result has less combinatorial significance, its proof uses an interesting new character-theoretic identity that might be of independent interest in algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>On Some Properties of Matrices with Entries Defined by Products of $k$-Fibonacci and $k$-Lucas Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ combinatorial and algebraic tools to derive closed-form expressions for several classical matrix invariants, including the determinant, inverse, trace, and powers, for a family of matrices whose entries are given by products of $k$-Fibonacci and $k$-Lucas numbers. Moreover, we compute the spectral radius and the energy of the graphs associated with this family of matrices. Finally, we investigate connections between the obtained formulas and certain integer sequences listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).</description>

      <title>When all directed cycles have the same weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A digraph $G$ is weightable if its edges can be weighted with real numbers such that the total weight in each directed cycle equals 1. There are several equivalent conditions: that $G$ admits a 0/1-weighting with the same property, or that $G$ contains no subdivided "double-cycle" as a subdigraph, or that for every triple of vertices, all directed cycles containing all three pass through them in the same cyclic order. And there is quite a rich supply of such digraphs: for instance, any digraph drawn in the plane such that each of its directed cycles rotates clockwise around the origin is weightable (let us call such digraphs "circular"), and there are weightable planar digraphs with much more complicated structure than this.
  Until now the general structure of weightable digraphs was not known, and that is our objective in this paper. We will show that:
  - there is a construction that builds every planar weightable digraph from circular digraphs; and
  - there is a (different) construction that builds every weightable digraph from planar ones.
  We derive a poly-time algorithm to test if a digraph is weightable.</description>

      <title>Perfect codes in weakly metric association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lloyd Theorem of (Sol\'e, 1989) is combined with the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma of theoretical computer science to derive non-existence results for perfect codes in the Lee metric, NRT metric, mixed Hamming metric, and for the sum-rank distance. The proofs are based on asymptotic enumeration of integer partitions. The framework is the new concept of {\em polynomial} weakly metric association schemes.
  A connection between this notion and the recent theory of multivariate P-polynomial schemes of ( Bannai et al. 2025) and of $m$-distance regular graphs ( Bernard et al 2025) is pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to the fractional quantum Hall effect and, in particular, to the Bernevig-Haldane conjectures, we investigates the behavior of Macdonald polynomials under specializations of the form q a t b = 1. Our main focus is to explain, in a simple and purely combinatorial way, why certain nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials indexed by staircase vectors with steps of height a and width b remain regular at the specialization q a t b+1 = 1, despite the presence of potential poles in their rational coefficients. To this end, we introduce a set of combinatorial tools that track how poles are created or cancelled along paths in the Yang-Baxter graph. By carefully constructing paths from the zero vector to the staircase and analyzing the resulting denominators, we show that the absence of certain poles follows from intrinsic symmetries and cancellations encoded in the Yang-Baxter graph.</description>

      <title>On the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let
  $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=R^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T=T^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula
  for the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graph $\Gamma$, investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of spanning trees of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity. In addition,
  we show that $F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau(\Gamma)x^n$ is a rational function with integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Further progress on Wojda's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two digraphs of order $n$ are said to pack if they can be found as edge-disjoint subgraphs of the complete digraph of order $n$. It is well established that if the sum of the sizes of the two digraphs is at most $2n-2$, then they pack, with this bound being sharp. However, it is sufficient for the size of the smaller digraph to be only slightly below $n$ for the sum of their sizes to significantly exceed this threshold while still guaranteeing the existence of a packing.
  In 1985, Wojda conjectured that for any $2 \leq m \leq n/2$, if one digraph has size at most $n - m$ and the other has size less than $2n - \lfloor n/m \rfloor$, then the two digraphs pack. It was previously known that this conjecture holds for $m = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. In this paper, we confirm it for $m \geq 93$ and $n \geq 31m$.</description>

      <title>Equiprojective polytopes in higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional polytope is called k-equiprojective if every planar projection along a direction non-parallel to any facet is a k-gon. In this article, we generalise equiprojectivity to higher dimensions and give a lower bound on the number of combinatorial types of equiprojective polytopes. We also establish the pathwise connectedness of a subset of the Grassmannian in the case of (d-2)-dimensional spaces with conditions on the explicit path. This makes it possible to extend the Hasan--Lubiw characterisation of equiprojectivity to higher dimensions. Equiprojectivity provides cases relevant to the study of the Shadow Vertex algorithm, showing there is no hope minimising the complexity of the projection. It also offers a reverse point of view on the usual study of planar projections of polytopes as the projections have a fixed size.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on the Expected Number of Distinct Patterns in a Random Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi_n$ be a uniformly chosen random permutation on $[n]$. The authors of [2] showed that the expected number of distinct consecutive patterns of all lengths $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in $\pi_n$ was $\frac{n^2}{2}(1-o(1))$ as $n\to\infty$, exhibiting the fact that random permutations pack consecutive patterns near-perfectly. A conjecture was made in [11] that the same is true for non-consecutive patterns, i.e., that there are $2^n(1-o(1))$ distinct non-consecutive patterns expected in a random permutation. This conjecture is false, but, in this paper, we prove that a random permutation contains an expected number of at least $2^{n-1}(1+o(1))$ distinct permutations; this number is half of the range of the number of distinct permutations.</description>

      <title>Structured eigenbases and pair state transfer on threshold graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Macharete, Del-Vecchio, Teixeira and de Lima showed that a star and any threshold graph on the same number of vertices share the same eigenbasis relative to the Laplacian matrix. We use this fact to establish two main results in this paper. The first one is a characterization of threshold graphs that are \textit{simply structured}, i.e., their associated Laplacian matrices have eigenbases consisting of vectors with entries from the set $\{-1,0,1\}$. Then, we provide sufficient conditions such that a simply structured threshold graph is weakly Hadamard diagonalizable (WHD). This allows us to list all connected simply structured threshold graphs on at most 20 vertices, and identify those that are WHD. Second, we characterize Laplacian pair state transfer on threshold graphs. In particular, we show that the existence of Laplacian vertex state transfer and Laplacian pair state transfer on a threshold graph are equivalent if and only if it is not a join of a complete graph and an empty graph of certain sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit tableau-level maps between indecomposable projective modules for the type A 0-Hecke algebra that assemble into canonical split short exact sequences lifting the basic ribbon product rule in NSym via concatenation and near-concatenation. Iterating these maps yields cochain complexes indexed by generalized ribbons; we prove these complexes are acyclic in positive degrees and that their zeroth cohomology is the projective module indexed by full concatenation. We apply these complexes, together with VandeBogert's ribbon Schur module criterion, to prove Koszulness for a naturally defined internally graded algebra object built from the 0-Hecke tower. Finally, we define skew projective modules whose noncommutative Frobenius characteristics realize skewing by fundamental quasisymmetric functions on NSym.</description>

      <title>Dean's conjecture and cycles modulo k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dean conjectured three decades ago that every graph with minimum degree at least $k\ge 3$ contains a cycle whose length is divisible by $k$. While the conjecture has been verified for $k\in \{3,4\}$, it remains open for $k\ge 5$. A weaker version, also proposed by Dean, asserting that every $k$-connected graph contains a cycle of length divisible by $k$, was resolved by Gao, Huo, Liu, and Ma using the notion of admissible cycles.
  In this paper, we resolve Dean's conjecture for all $k\ge 6$. In fact, we prove a stronger result by showing that every graph with minimum degree at least $k$ contains cycles of length $r \pmod k$ for every even integer $r$, unless every end-block belongs to a specific family of exceptional graphs, which fail only to contain cycles of length $2 \pmod k$. We also establish a strengthened result on the existence of admissible cycles. Our proof introduces two sparse graph families, called trigonal graphs and tetragonal graphs, which provide a flexible framework for studying path and cycle lengths and may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study several bialgebraic structures on boolean functions, that is to say maps defined on the set of subsets of a finite set $X$, taking the value $0$ on $\emptyset$. Examples of boolean functions are given by the indicator function of the hyperedges of a given hypergraph, or the rank function of a matroid. We give the species of boolean functions a two-parameters family of products and a coproduct, and this defines a two-parameters family of twisted bialgebras. We then try to define a second coproduct on boolean functions, based on contractions, in order to obtain a double bialgebra. We show that this is not possible on the whole species of boolean functions, but that there exists a maximal subspecies where this is possible. This subspecies being rather mysterious, we introduce rigid boolean functions and show that this subspecies has indeed a second coproduct, as wished, and that it contains rank functions of matroids and indicator functions associated to hypergraphs. As a consequence, we obtain a unique polynomial invariant on rigid boolean functions, which is a generalization of the chromatic polynomial of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending some properties from the Euclidean plane to any normed plane, we show the validity of the Monma-Paterson-Suri-Yao algorithm for finding the maximum-weighted spanning tree of a set of $n$ points, where the weight of an edge is the distance between the end points measured by the norm and there are not repeated distances. For strictly convex normed planes, we expose an strategy for moving slightly the points of the set in order to obtain distinct distances.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous substructures in random ordered uniform matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ordered $r$-uniform matching of size $n$ is a collection of $n$ pairwise disjoint $r$-subsets of a linearly ordered set of $rn$ vertices. For $n=2$, such a matching is called an $r$-pattern, as it represents one of $\tfrac12\binom{2r}r$ ways two disjoint edges may intertwine. Given a set $\mathcal{P}$ of $r$-patterns, a $\mathcal{P}$-clique is a matching with all pairs of edges belonging to $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper we determine the order of magnitude of the size of a largest $\mathcal{P}$-clique in a random ordered $r$-uniform matching for several sets $\mathcal{P}$, including all sets of size $|\mathcal{P}|\le2$ and the set $\mathcal{R}^{(r)}$ of all $2^{r-1}$ $r$-partite $r$-patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nonempty graph $G$, a collection of nonempty graphs $\cal{H}$, and a positive integer $k$, the Gallai-Ramsey number $\mathrm{gr}_k(G:\mathcal{H})$ is defined to be the minimum positive integer $n$ such that every exact $k$-edge-coloring of a complete graph $K_n$ contains either a rainbow copy of $G$ or a monochromatic copy of some element in $\mathcal{H}$. In this paper, we obtain some exact values and general lower and upper bounds for $\mathrm{gr}_k(G:\mathcal{F}^\ell)$, where $\mathcal{F}^\ell$ is the set of $\ell$-connected graphs and $G\in\{P_5, K_{1,3}\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cristofaro-Gardiner and Kleinman showed the complete period collapse of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial of Fibonacci triangles and their irrational limits, by studying the Fourier-Dedekind sums involved in the Ehrhart function of right-angled rational triangles. We generalize this result using integral affine geometrical methods to all Markov triangles, as defined by Vianna. In particular, we show new occurrences of strong period collapse, namely by constructing for each Markov number $p$ a two-sided sequence of rational triangles and two irrational limits with quasipolynomial Ehrhart function of period $p$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results relating the basis number of a graph $G$ to path decompositions of $G$. Our first result shows that the basis number of a graph is at most four times its pathwidth. Our second result shows that, if a graph $G$ has a path decomposition with adhesions of size at most $k$ in which the graph induced by each bag has basis number at most $b$, then $G$ has basis number at most $b+O(k\log^2 k)$. The first result, combined with recent work of Geniet and Giocanti shows that the basis number of a graph is bounded by a polynomial function of its treewidth. The second result (also combined with the work of Geniet and Giocanti) shows that every $K_t$-minor-free graph has a basis number bounded by a polynomial function of $t$.</description>

Abstract: We study the Universal Difference Property (UDP) introduced by Alt{\i}nok, Anders, Arreola, Asencio, Ireland, Sar{\i}o\u{g}lan, and Smith, focusing on the relationship between the structural properties of a graph and UDP. We present condtions for when UDP must hold on unicyclic graphs. We then prove that if UDP does not hold on an edge-labeled graph, then it cannot hold on any subdivision of that graph. Additionally, we show that if an edge-labeled graph satisfies the pairwise edge-disjoint path property, then the graph satisfies UDP. Lastly, we explore the relationship between UDP and subgraphs and prove that trees and cycles are the only two families of connected graphs for which UDP must hold for any edge-labeling over any ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph burning is a discrete-time process on graphs where vertices are sequentially activated and burning vertices cause their neighbours to burn over time. In this work, we focus on a dynamic setting in which the graph grows over time, and at each step we burn vertices in the growing grid $G_n = [-f(n),f(n)]^2$. We investigate the set of achievable burning densities for functions of the form $f(n)=\lceil cn^\alpha\rceil$, where $\alpha \ge 1$ and $c&gt;0$. We show that for $\alpha=1$, the set of achievable densities is $[1/(2c^2),1]$, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, every density in $[0,1]$ is achievable, and for $\alpha=3/2$, the set of achievable densities is $[0,(1+\sqrt{6}c)^{-2}]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an exact relation between the S-symplectomorphism and the S-matrix by means of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The adjoint action of the S-matrix defines a fuzzy diffeomorphism on phase space whose classical limit is the S-symplectomorphism. The relation between classical and quantum eikonals is immediate via $\hbar$-deformation of each Poisson bracket in the Magnus formula. Diagrammatic computation of quantum eikonal is illustrated for quantizations in both symmetric and normal orderings.</description>

      <title>Exact Computation of the Catalan Number $C(2,050,572,903)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-phase algorithm for computing exact Catalan numbers at an unprecedented scale. The method is demonstrated by computing $C(n)$ for $n = 2,050,572,903$ yielding a result with a targeted $1,234,567,890$ decimal digits. To circumvent the memory limitations associated with evaluating large factorials, the algorithm operates exclusively in the prime-exponent domain. Phase 1 employs a parallel segmented sieve to enumerate primes up to $2n$ and applies Legendre's formula to determine the precise prime factorization of $C(n)$. The primes are grouped by exponent and serialized to disk. Phase 2 reconstructs the final integer using a memory-efficient balanced product tree with chunking. The algorithm runs on a time complexity of $\Theta(n(\log n)^2)$ bit-operations and a space complexity of $\Theta(n \log n)$ bits. This result represents the largest exact Catalan number computed to date. Performance statistics for a single-machine execution are reported, and verification strategies -- including modular checks and SHA-256 hash validation -- are discussed. The source code and factorization data are provided to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Random Local Search Algorithm for Dominating Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominating Set is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem which finds application in computational biology or mobile communication. Because of its $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness, one often turns to heuristics for good solutions. Many such heuristics have been empirically tested and perform rather well. However, it is not well understood why their results are so good or even what guarantees they can offer regarding their runtime or the quality of their results. For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\mathcal{O}\left(n^4\log^2(n)\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum. For our proof we use techniques which are already quite popular for the analysis of randomized algorithms. We further apply a special method to analyze a reversible Markov Chain, which arises as a result of our modeling. This method has not yet found wide application in this kind of runtime analysis.</description>

Abstract: We prove a family of partition identities involving integer partitions in three colors. The conditions imposed on the types of partitions appearing in these identities involve constraints that arise in the Rogers-Ramanujan and Andrews-Gordon identities, as well as in their recent extensions. The identities established in this paper are associated with the $A_r$ surface singularities via the arc HP-series, which provides a measure of singularities of algebraic varieties defined using arc spaces.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples, Constructions, and Nonexistence Results for Optimal Ternary Cyclic Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic codes are an important subclass of linear codes with wide applications in communication systems and data storage systems. In 2013, Ding and Helleseth presented nine open problems on optimal ternary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$. While the first two and the sixth problems have been fully solved, others remain open. In this paper, we advance the study of the third and fourth open problems by providing the first counterexamples to both and constructing two families of optimal codes under certain conditions, thereby partially solving the third problem. Furthermore, we investigate the cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ where $e(3^h\pm 1)\equiv\frac{3^m-a}{2}\pmod{3^m-1}$ and $a$ is odd. For $a\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, we present two new families of optimal codes with parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-1-2m,4]$, generalizing known constructions. For $a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, we obtain several nonexistence results on optimal codes $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ with the aforementioned parameters revealing the constraints of such codes.</description>

      <title>Explicit Almost-Optimal $\varepsilon$-Balanced Codes via Free Expander Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of constructing explicit codes whose rate and distance match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the low-rate, high-distance regime. In 2017, Ta-Shma gave an explicit family of codes where every pair of codewords has relative distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$, with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)})$, matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound up to a factor of $\varepsilon^{o(1)}$. Ta-Shma's construction was based on starting with a good code and amplifying its bias with walks arising from the $s$-wide-replacement product.
  In this work, we give an arguably simpler almost-optimal construction, based on what we call free expander walks: ordinary expander walks where each step is taken on a distinct expander from a carefully chosen sequence. This sequence of expanders is derived from the construction of near-$X$-Ramanujan graphs due to O'Donnell and Wu.</description>

      <title>Explicit Entropic Constructions for Coverage, Facility Location, and Graph Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shannon entropy is a polymatroidal set function and lies at the foundation of information theory, yet the class of entropic polymatroids is strictly smaller than the class of all submodular functions. In parallel, submodular and combinatorial information measures (SIMs) have recently been proposed as a principled framework for extending entropy, mutual information, and conditional mutual information to general submodular functions, and have been used extensively in data subset selection, active learning, domain adaptation, and representation learning. This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense. These results establish a direct bridge between combinatorial information measures and classical information theory for many of the most common submodular objectives used in applications.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Razborov's Flag Algebra as a Proof System for Extremal Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Razborov's flag algebra forms a powerful framework for deriving asymptotic inequalities between induced subgraph densities, underpinning many advances in extremal graph theory. This survey introduces flag algebra to computer scientists working in logic, programming languages, automated verification, and formal methods. We take a logical perspective on flag algebra and present it in terms of syntax, semantics, and proof strategies, in a style closer to formal logic. One popular proof strategy derives valid inequalities by first proving inequalities in a labelled variant of flag algebra and then transferring them to the original unlabelled setting using the so-called downward operator. We explain this strategy in detail and highlight that its transfer mechanism relies on the notion of what we call an adjoint pair, reminiscent of Galois connections and categorical adjunctions, which appear frequently in work on automated verification and programming languages. Along the way, we work through representative examples, including Mantel's theorem and Goodman's bound on Ramsey multiplicity, to illustrate how mathematical arguments can be carried out symbolically in the flag algebra framework.</description>

Abstract: Volume polynomials form a distinguished class of log-concave polynomials with remarkable analytic and combinatorial properties. I will survey realization problems related to them, review fundamental inequalities they satisfy, and discuss applications to the combinatorics of algebraic matroids. These notes are based on lectures given at the 2025 Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry at Colorado State University.</description>

      <title>Double Hall-Littlewood symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a ring isomorphism between the derived Hall algebra of the Jordan quiver and the ring of double symmetric functions (i.e., the ring of symmetric polynomials in two sets of countably many variables, invariant under the respective actions of their symmetric groups) with a parameter $t$. This isomorphism maps the derived Hall basis (the natural basis of the derived Hall algebra) to a class of double Hall-Littlewood (HL) symmetric functions, which are formulated via raising and lowering operators. These double HL functions are parameterized by bipartitions; they reduce to the classical HL functions when one of the partitions is empty, and specialize to Schur Laurent symmetric functions at $t = 0$. We also derive the Pieri rules for these double HL functions. Additionally, we obtain several natural generating functions for the derived Hall algebra as well as their transition relations, which can be transferred to the ring of double symmetric functions via the established ring isomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the stability, complexity, and distribution of similarity classes of the longest edge bisection process for triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Longest Edge Bisection (LEB) of a triangle is performed by joining the midpoint of its longest edge to the opposite vertex. Applying this procedure iteratively produces an infinite family of triangles. Surprisingly, a classical result of Adler (1983) shows that for any initial triangle, this infinite family falls into finitely many similarity classes.
  While the set of classes is finite, we show that a far smaller, stable subset of ``fat'' triangles, called {\bf terminal quadruples}, effectively dominates the final mesh structure. We prove the following asymptotic area distribution result: for every initial triangle, the portion of area occupied by terminal quadruples tends to one, with the convergence occurring at an exponential rate. In fact, we provide the precise distribution of triangles in every step. We introduce the {\bf bisection graph} and use spectral methods to establish this result.
  Given this dominance, we provide a complete characterization of triangles possessing a single terminal quadruple, while conversely exhibiting a sequence of triangles with an unbounded number of terminal quadruples. Furthermore, we reveal several fundamental geometric properties of the points of a terminal quadruple, laying the groundwork for studying the geometric distribution of the entire orbit. Our analysis leverages the hyperbolic geometry framework of Perdomo and Plaza (2014) and refines their techniques.</description>

      <title>Area-universality in Outerplanar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rectangular floorplan is a partition of a rectangle into smaller rectangles such that no four rectangles meet at a single point. Rectangular floorplans arise naturally in a variety of applications, including VLSI design, architectural layout, and cartography, where efficient and flexible spatial subdivisions are required. A central concept in this domain is that of area-universality: a floorplan (or more generally, a rectangular layout) is area-universal if, for any assignment of target areas to its constituent rectangles, there exists a combinatorially equivalent layout that realizes these areas.
  In this paper, we investigate the structural conditions under which an outerplanar graph admits an area-universal rectangular layout. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for area-universality in this setting, thereby providing a complete characterization of admissible outerplanar graphs. Furthermore, we present an algorithmic construction that guarantees that the resulting layout is always area-universal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop some tools, of an algebraic and combinatorial nature, which enable us to obtain a detailed description of certain quadratic subgroups of the (outer) reduced Weyl group of the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal O}_n$. In particular, for $n=4$ our findings give a self-contained theoretical interpretation of the groups tabulated in [AJS18], which were obtained with the help of a computer. For each of these groups we provide a set of generators. A prominent role in our analysis is played by a certain family of subgroups of the symmetric group of a discrete square which we call bicompatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence $S=(x_1,\ldots, x_k)$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ is called a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum sequence if there exist $a_1,\ldots,a_k\in Q_p$ such that $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k=0$ and $a_1+\cdots+a_k=0$. The constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every sequence of length $k$ in $\mathbb Z_p$ has a $(Q_p,\mathbf 1)$-weighted zero-sum subsequence of length $p$. We determine the constant $E_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and the related constants $C_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$ and $D_{Q_p,\mathbf 1}$. We also study some $(Q_p,B)$-weighted zero-sum constants where $B$ is a subset of $Q_p$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce classes of supergraphs and superpermutations with novel universal graphon and permuton limiting objects whose construction involves the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process introduced by Pitman and Yor (1997). We demonstrate the universality of these limiting objects through general invariance principles in a heavy-tailed regime and establish a comprehensive phase diagram for the asymptotic shape of superstructures.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances between ERGMs and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are random graph models under which the presence of certain small structures (such as triangles) is encouraged; they can be constructed by tilting an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model by the exponential of a particular nonlinear Hamiltonian. These models are mixtures of metastable wells which each behave macroscopically like an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model, exhibiting the same laws of large numbers for subgraph counts [CD13]. However, on the microscopic scale these metastable wells are very different from Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi models, with the total variation distance between the two measures tending to 1 [MX23]. In this article we clarify this situation by providing a sharp (up to constants) bound on the Hamming-Wasserstein distance between the two models, which is the average number of edges at which they differ, under the coupling which minimizes this average. In particular, we show that this distance is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$, quantifying exactly how these models differ. 
  An upper bound of this form has appeared in the past [RR19], but this was restricted to the subcritical (high-temperature) regime of parameters. We extend this bound, using a new proof technique, to the supercritical (low-temperature) regime, and prove a matching lower bound which has only previously appeared in the subcritical regime of special cases of ERGMs satisfying a "triangle-free" condition [DF25]. To prove the lower bound in the presence of triangles, we introduce an approximation of the discrete derivative of the Hamiltonian, which controls the dynamical properties of the ERGM, in terms of local counts of triangles and wedges (two-stars) near an edge. This approximation is the main technical and conceptual contribution of the article, and we expect it will be useful in a variety of other contexts as well. Along the way, we also prove a bound on the marginal edge probability under the ERGM via a new bootstrapping argument. Such a bound has already appeared [FLSW25], but again only in the subcritical regime and using a different proof strategy.</description>

      <title>Tropical Methods for Counting Plane Curves -- Complex, Real and Quadratically Enriched</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first famous correspondence theorem by Mikhalkin appeared in 2005, tropical geometry has allowed a parallel treatment of real and complex counting problems. A prime example are the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of the plane which count rational plane curves of degree d satisfying point conditions and their real counterpart, the Welschinger invariants, which both can be determined using tropical methods. Remarkably, the tropical computation of the two types of invariants works entirely in parallel. Recently, quadratically enriched enumerative geometry enables us to combine such real and complex counts under one roof, providing a simultaneous approach which can also be used for counts over other fields. Tropical geometry is a successful tool for the study and computation of such quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, too. In this survey, we provide an overview of tropical methods for plane curve counting problems over the real and complex numbers, and the new quadratically enriched counts.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any planar convex body C there is a positive integer m with the property that any finite point set P in the plane can be three-colored such that there is no translate of C containing at least m points of P, all of the same color. As a part of the proof, we show a strengthening of the Erd\H{o}s-Sands-Sauer-Woodrow conjecture. Surprisingly, the proof also relies on the two dimensional case of the Illumination conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factorization structures occur in toric differential and discrete geometry, and can be viewed in multiple ways, e.g., as objects determining substantial classes of explicit toric Sasaki and K\"ahler geometries, as special coordinates on such, or as an apex generalisation of cyclic polytopes featuring a generalised Gale's evenness condition. This article presents a comprehensive study of factorization structures. It establishes their structure theory and introduces their use in the geometry of cones and polytopes. The article explains the construction of polytopes and cones compatible with a given factorization structure, and exemplifies it for product Segre-Veronese and Veronese factorization structures, where the latter case includes cyclic polytopes. Further, it derives the generalised Gale's evenness condition for compatible cones, polytopes and their duals, and explicitly describes faces of these. Factorization structures naturally provide generalised Vandermonde identities, which relate normals of any compatible polytope, and which are used for Veronese factorization structure to find examples of Delzant and rational Delzant compatible polytopes. The article offers a myriad of factorization structure examples, which are later characterised to be precisely factorization structures with decomposable curves, and raises the question if these encompass all factorization structures, i.e., the existence of an indecomposable factorization curve.</description>

Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic structure whose binary operation is idempotent, right-invertible and right self-distributive. Right-invertibility ensures right translations are permutations and right self-distributivity ensures further they are automorphisms. For finite connected quandles, all right translations have the same cycle structure, called the profile of the connected quandle. Hayashi conjectured that the longest length in the profile of a finite connected quandle is a multiple of the remaining lengths. We prove that this conjecture is true for profiles with at most five lengths.</description>

Moreover, we give a characterization of such $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda\subseteq\Gamma$ for which the same family of $A$-paths satisfies the full Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop equivalent spectral graph theory for several fundamental graph cut problems including maxcut, mincut, Cheeger cut, anti-Cheeger cut, dual Cheeger problem and their useful variants. A specified strategy for achieving an equivalent eigenproblem is proposed for a general graph cut problem via the set-pair Lov\'asz extension and the Dinkelbach scheme. For a class of 2-cut and 3-cut problems, we reveal the intrinsic difference-of-submodularity for the fractional formulations and show that their set-pair Lov\'asz extensions yield equivalent difference-of-convex structures. Building on the Dinkelbach scheme, we finally establish a unified research roadmap for nonlinear spectral theory that provides a one-to-one correspondence between certain eigenpairs and the optimal graph cut problems. The finer structure of the eigenvectors, the Courant nodal domain theorem and the graphic feature of eigenvalues are studied systematically in the setting of these new nonlinear eigenproblems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rank (also known as protection number or leaf-height) of a vertex in a rooted tree is the minimum distance between the vertex and any of its leaf descendants. We consider the sum of ranks over all vertices (known as the security) in binary trees, and produce a classification of families of binary trees for which the security is maximized. In addition, extremal results relating to maximum rank among all vertices in families of trees is discussed.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees in directed square cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify weakly connected spanning closed (WCSC) subgraphs of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$, the square of a directed $n$-vertex cycle. Then we show that every spanning tree of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$ is contained in a unique nontrivial WCSC subgraph of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$. As a result, we obtain a purely combinatorial derivation of the formula for the number of directed spanning trees of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$. Moreover, we obtain the formula for the number of directed spanning trees of $\overrightarrow{C_n^2}$, which is a Jacobsthal number.</description>

      <title>On the Relation Between Treewidth, Tree-Independence Number, and Tree-Chromatic Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two recently introduced graph parameters, both of which measure the complexity of the tree decompositions of a given graph. Recall that the treewidth ${\rm tw}(G)$ of a graph $G$ measures the largest number of vertices required in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$. Similarly, the tree-independence number ${\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\alpha(G)$ and the tree-chromatic number ${\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\chi(G)$ measure the largest independence number, respectively the largest chromatic number, required in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$.
  Recently, Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel asked (JCTB, 2024) whether for all graphs $G$ it holds that ${\rm tw}(G)+1 \leq {\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\alpha(G) \cdot {\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\chi(G)$. We provide a negative answer for this question in a strong form: for every function $f\colon {\mathbb N} \rightarrow {\mathbb N}$, there exists a graph $G$ such that ${\rm tw}(G) &gt; {\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\alpha(G) \cdot f({\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\chi(G))$. On the other hand, we complement this result with an upper bound, by showing that ${\rm tw}(G)+1 \leq {\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\alpha(G)^2 \cdot {\rm tree\textnormal{-}}\chi(G)$ for every graph $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between densities of cycles and the spectrum of a graphon, which implies that the spectra of convergent graphons converge, fundamentally relies on the self-adjointness of the linear operator associated with a graphon. In this short paper, we consider the setting of digraphons, which are limits of directed graphs, and prove that the spectra of convergent digraphons converge. Using this result, we establish the relation between densities of directed cycles and the spectrum of a digraphon.</description>

Abstract: A k-distance r-coloring of a graph is a coloring of the vertices of the graph such that if the distance between 2 vertices x and y is less or equal to k, then x and y must have distinct colors. A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn with no edge crossing. We will study the 2-distance coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree at least 6.</description>

      <title>Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of Some Bull-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges, a {\em fork } is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and an {\em odd torch} is a graph obtained from an odd hole by adding an edge $xy$ such that $x$ is non-adjacent to any vertex on the odd hole and the set of neighbors of $y$ on the odd hole is a stable set.
  Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019) 54-60] proved that every (odd hole, bull)-free graph and every ($P_5$, bull)-free graph are perfectly divisible. Karthick {\em et al.} [The Electron. J. of Combin. 29 (2022) P3.19.] proved that every (fork, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Chen and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 372 (2025) 298-307.] proved that every ($P_7,C_5$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Let $H\in$\{\{odd~torch\}, $\{P_8,C_5\}\}$. In this paper, we prove that every ($H$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. We also prove that a ($P_6$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Mycielski-Gr\"{o}tzsch graph as an induced subgraph. As corollaries, these graphs are $\binom{\omega+1}{2}$-colorable. Notice that every odd torch contains an odd hole, an induced $P_5$, and an induced fork. Therefore, our results generalize their findings. Moreover, we prove that every ($P_6$, bull)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\omega(G)^7$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the propagation radius in power domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $S \subseteq V(G)$. It is said that $S$ \textit{dominates} $N[S]$. We say that $S$ \textit{monitors} vertices of $G$ as follows. Initially, all dominated vertices are monitored. This step is called the \textit{domination} step. Thereafter, the set of unmonitored vertices of which each is the only unmonitored neighbour of a monitored vertex, is monitored. This step is called a \textit{propagation} step and is repeated until the process terminates. The process terminates when the there are no monitored vertices which have exactly one unmonitored neighbour. This combined process of initial domination and subsequent propagation is called \textit{power domination}. If all vertices of $G$ are monitored at termination, then $S$ is said to be a \textit{power dominating set (PDS) of $G$}. The \textit{power domination number of $G$}, denoted as $\gamma_p(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a PDS of $G$. The \textit{propagation radius of $G$} is the minimum number of steps it takes a minimum PDS to monitor $V(G)$. In this paper we determine an upper bound on the propagation radius of $G$ with regards to power domination, in terms of $\delta$ and $n$. We show that this bound is only attained when $\gamma_p(G)=1$ and then improve this bound for $\gamma_p(G)\geq 2$. Sharpness examples for these bounds are provided. We also present sharp upper bounds on the propagation radius of split graphs. We present sharpness results for a known lower bound of the propagation radius for all $\Delta\geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: Which permutations of a probability distribution on integers minimize variance?
  Let $X$ be a random variable on a set of integers $\{x_1, \dots, x_N\}$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_i = x_i) = p_i$, $i \in \{1,\dots,N\}$. Let $(p^{(1)}, \dots, p^{(N)})$ be the sequence $(p_1, \dots, p_N)$ ordered non-increasingly. Let $X^+$ be the random variable defined by $\mathbb{P}(X^+=0)=p^{(1)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X^+=1) = p^{(2)}$, $\mathbb{P}(X^+=-1)=p^{(3)}, \dots, \mathbb{P}(X^+=(-1)^N \lfloor \frac {N} 2 \rfloor)=p^{(N)}$. In this short note we generalize and prove the inequality $\mathrm{Var}\, X^+ \le \mathrm{Var}\, X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new results on combinatorial characterizations of covering properties in end spaces and ray spaces. In particular, we characterize the Lindel\"of degree, the extent, the Rothberger property, $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property for ray, end and edge-end spaces. We show that $\sigma$-compactness and the Menger property are equivalent for these spaces, and that they are all $D$-spaces. As an application of some of these characterizations, we are able to provide combinatorial characterizations of graphs with countably many ends and edge-ends.</description>

      <title>Existence of 3 anti-cocircular truncated M\"obius planes and constructions of strength-4 covering arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two projective (affine) planes with the same point sets are orthogoval if the common intersection of any two lines, one from each, has size at most two. The existence of a pair of orthogoval projective planes has been proven and published independently many times. A strength-$t$ covering array, denoted by CA$(N; t, k, v)$, is an $N \times k$ array over a $v$-set such that in any $t$-set of columns, each $t$-tuple occurs at least once in a row. A pair of orthogoval projective planes can be used to construct a strength-$3$ covering array CA$(2q^3-1; 3, q^2 + q + 1, q)$. Our work extends this result to construct arrays of strength $4$. A $k$-cap in a projective geometry is a set of $k$ points no three of which are collinear. In $PG(3,q)$, an ovoid is a maximum-sized $k$-cap with $k =q^2+1$. Its plane sections (circles) are the blocks of a $3-(q^2 + 1, q + 1, 1)$ design, called a M\"obius plane of order $q$. For $q$ an odd prime power, we prove the existence of three truncated M\"obius planes, such that for any choice of these circles, one from each plane, their intersection size is at most three. From this, we construct a strength-$4$ covering array CA$(3q^4-2; 4, \frac{q^2+1}{2}, q)$. For $q \geq 11$, these covering arrays improve the size of the best-known covering arrays with the same parameters by almost 25 percent. The CA$(3q^4 -3; 4, \frac{q^2 +1}{2}, q)$ is used as the main ingredient in a recursive construction to obtain a CA$(5q^4 - 4q^3 - q^2 + 2q; 4, q^2 +1, q)$. Some improvements are obtained in the size of the best-known arrays using these covering arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial and density properties of infinite words generated by Fibonacci-type morphisms, focusing on their subword structure, palindrome density, and extremal statistical behaviors. Using the morphism $0 \to 01$, $1 \to 0$, we define a derived ternary word $\mathbb{Y}$ and establish new results relating its density components $\mathrm{dens}(\lambda,n)$, $\mathrm{dens}(\alpha,n)$, and $\mathrm{dens}(\beta,n)$, deriving explicit formulae and bounds on their behavior. We further prove a general density theorem for infinite words with paired subwords, showing that the associated palindromic prefix density is bounded above by $\frac{1}{\varphi_1}$, where $\varphi_1 = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio. Our approach connects the structure of Fibonacci and Thue--Morse sequences with precise asymptotic and combinatorial interpretations for the observed densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the minimal number of vertices $\lambda(n,d)$ required in a triangulation of the $n$-sphere to admit a simplicial map to the boundary of a $(n+1)$-simplex with a given degree $d$. We establish upper bounds for $\lambda(n,d)$ in dimensions $n \geq 3$. Furthermore, we provide exact formulas for small values of $d$, showing that $\lambda(n,d)=n+d+3$ for $n \geq 3$ and $d=2,3,4$. A key technical result is the identity $\lambda(n,d) = \lambda(d-1,d) + n - d + 1$ for $n \geq d$, which allows us to reduce higher-dimensional cases to lower-dimensional ones. The proofs involve constructive methods based on local modifications of triangulations and combinatorial arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the famous Erd\H{o}s--S\'os forbidden intersection problem for words over an alphabet of size $m$: what is the maximal size of a subfamily $\mathcal{F}$ of $[m]^n$ that does not contain two vectors $x, y$ coinciding on exactly $t - 1$ coordinates? We answer this question provided $m \ge \operatorname{poly}(t)$ and $n \ge \operatorname{poly}(t)$ for some polynomial function $\operatorname{poly}(\cdot)$ of $t$, greatly extending the recent result of Keevash, Lifshitz, Long and Minzer. Our proof combines some of the recently developed methods in extremal combinatorics, including the spread approximation technique of Kupavskii and Zakharov and the hypercontractivity approach developed in a series of works by Keevash, Keller, Lifshitz, Long, Marcus and Minzer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-induced-minor-free if no induced minor of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$, We denote by $W_{t\times t}$ the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid, and by $K_{t,t}$ the complete bipartite graph with both sides of the bipartition of size $t$. We show that the class of $\{K_{t,t},W_{t\times t}\}$-induced minor-free graphs with bounded clique number has subpolynomial treewidth. Specifically, we prove that for every integer $t$ there exist $\epsilon \in (0,1]$ and $c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every $n$-vertex $\{K_{t,t},W_{t\times t}\}$-induced minor-free graph with no clique of size $t$ has treewidth at most $2^{c\log^{1-\epsilon}n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a vector space of rectangular $n\times k$ matrices annihilating the Cullis' determinant. We show that $\dim(V) \le (n-1)k$, extending Dieudonn{\'{e}}'s result on the dimension of vector spaces of square matrices annihilating the ordinary determinant.
  Furthermore, for certain values of $n$ and $k$, we explicitly describe such vector spaces of maximal dimension. Namely, we establish that if $k$ is odd, $n \ge k + 2$ and $\dim(V) = (n-1)k$, then $V$ is equal to the space of all $n\times k$ matrices $X$ such that alternating row sum of $X$ is equal to zero.
  Our proofs rely on the following observations from the matroid theory that have an independent interest. First, we provide a notion of matroid corresponding to a given linear variety. Second, we prove that if the linear variety is transformed by projections and restrictions, then the behaviour of the corresponding matroid is expressed in the terms of matroid contraction and restriction. Third, we establish that if $M$ is a matroid, $I^*$ its coindependent set $M|S$ and its restriction on a set $S$, then the union of $I^*\setminus S$ with every cobase of $M|S$ is coindependent set of $M$.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of these notes is to introduce some of the problems the enumeration of lattice walks is dedicated to and familiarize with some of the arguments they can be addressed with. We discuss the enumeration of lattice walks, their generating functions, and the functional equations they satisfy. We focus on algebraic methods for manipulating and solving these equations. Elementary power series algebra plays a prominent role, computer algebra too, but we repeatedly digress and present ideas and methods of different kind whenever it is appropriate. The exposition is organized around the most simple yet non-trivial problem: the enumeration of simple walks on the half-line. The intention is to illustrate different techniques without getting technical.</description>

Abstract: We present two applications of recent developments in incidence geometry. One is a $\delta$-discretised version of a particular `Elekes--R\'onyai' expander problem. The second application is an incidence estimate addressing the scenario when both tubes, squares and their shadings satisfy non-concentration assumptions.</description>

      <title>A modern perspective on Tutte's homotopy theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin with a review of Tutte's homotopy theory, which concerns the structure of certain graph associated to a matroid (together with some extra data). Concretely, Tutte's path theorem asserts that this graph is connected, and his homotopy theorem asserts that every cycle in the graph is a composition of ''elementary cycles'', which come in four different flavors. We present an extended version of the homotopy theorem, in which we give a more refined classification of the different types of elementary cycles. We explain in detail how the path theorem allows one to prove that the foundation of a matroid (in the sense of Baker--Lorscheid) is generated by universal cross-ratios, and how the extended homotopy theorem allows one to classify all algebraic relations between universal cross-ratios. The resulting ''fundamental presentation'' of the foundation was previously established in [Baker--Lorscheid], but the argument here is more self-contained. We then recall a few applications of the fundamental presentation to the representation theory of matroids. Finally, in the most novel but also the most speculative part of the paper, we discuss what a ''higher Tutte homotopy theorem'' might look like, and we present some preliminary computations along these lines.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between spread and width for tree decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between (average) spread and width in tree decompositions, answering several questions from Wood [arXiv:2509.01140]. The spread of a vertex $v$ in a tree decomposition is the number of bags that contain $v$. Wood asked for which $c&gt;0$, there exists $c'$ such that each graph $G$ has a tree decomposition of width $c\cdot tw(G)$ in which each vertex $v$ has spread at most $c'(d(v)+1)$. We show that $c\geq 2$ is necessary and that $c&gt;3$ is sufficient. Moreover, we answer a second question fully by showing that near-optimal average spread can be achieved simultaneously with width $O(tw(G))$.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the Ising free energy on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,m)$ with bounded average degree $d=2m/n$. Specifically, we determine the limiting distribution of $\log Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$, where $Z_{\mathbb{G}(n,m)}(\beta,B)$ is the partition function at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and external field $B\geq0$.
  If either $B&gt;0$, or $B=0$, $d&gt;1$ and $\beta&gt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is a Gaussian whose variance is of order $\Theta(n)$ and is described by a family of stochastic fixed point problems that encode the root magnetisation of two correlated Galton-Watson trees. By contrast, if $B=0$ and either $d\leq1$ or $\beta&lt;\operatorname{ath}(1/d)$ the limiting distribution is an infinite sum of independent random variables and has bounded variance.</description>

      <title>Solution to a Problem of Erd\H{o}s Concerning Distances and Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1997, Erd\H{o}s asked whether for arbitrarily large $n$ there exists a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that determines $O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}})$ distinct distances while satisfying the local constraint that every 4-point subset determines at least 3 distinct pairwise distances. We construct $n$-point sets from an $m\times m$ box of the lattice $L = \{(x,\sqrt{2}y):x,y \in \mathbb{Z}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2.$ The distinct distance bound follows from applying Bernays' theorem to the number of integers represented by the binary quadratic form $u^2 + 2v^2$. The local 4-point constraint is verified through Perucca's similarity classification of the six similarity types determining exactly two distances.</description>

      <title>On generalized Tur\'{a}n problems for expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, the $r$-expansion $F^r$ of $F$ is the $r$-uniform hypergraph obtained from $F$ by inserting $r-2$ new distinct vertices in each edge of $F$. Given $r$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{F}$, the generalized Tur\'{a}n number, denoted by $\textrm{ex}_r(n,\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$, is the maximum number of copies of $\mathcal{H}$ in an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph that does not contain $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. In the case where $r=2$ (i.e., the graph case), the study of generalized Tur\'{a}n problems was initiated by Alon and Shikhelman [\textit{J. Combin. Theory Series B.} 121 (2016) 146--172]. Motivated by their work, we systematically study generalized Tur\'{a}n problems for expansions and obtain several general and exact results. In particular, for the non-degenerate case, we determine the exact generalized Tur\'{a}n number for expansions of complete graphs, and establish the asymptotics of the generalized Tur\'{a}n number for expansions of the vertex-disjoint union of complete graphs. For the degenerate case, we establish the asymptotics of generalized Tur\'{a}n numbers for expansions of several classes of forests, including star forests, linear forests and star-path forests.</description>

      <title>AlphaMapleSAT: An MCTS-based Cube-and-Conquer SAT Solver for Hard Combinatorial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AlphaMapleSAT, a Cube-and-Conquer (CnC) parallel SAT solver that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with deductive feedback to efficiently solve challenging combinatorial SAT problems. Traditional lookahead cubing methods, used by solvers such as March, limit their search depth to reduce overhead often resulting in suboptimal partitions. By contrast, AlphaMapleSAT performs a deeper MCTS search guided by deductive rewards from SAT solvers. This approach enables informed exploration of the cubing space while keeping cubing costs low. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique via extensive evaluations against the widely used and established March cubing solver on three well-known challenging combinatorial benchmarks, including the minimum Kochen-Specker (KS) problem from quantum mechanics, the Murty-Simon Conjecture, and the Ramsey problems from extremal graph theory. We compare AlphaMapleSAT against March using different types of conquering solvers such as SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS) and SAT+CAS, both built on top of the CaDiCaL SAT solver. We show that in all cases, there is a speedup in elapsed real time (wall clock time) ranging from 1.61x to 7.57x on a 128 core machine for the above-mentioned problems. We also perform cube-level and parallel scaling analysis over 32, 64, and 128 cores, which shows that AlphaMapleSAT outperforms March on all these settings. Our results show that deductively-guided MCTS search technique for cubing in CnC solvers can significantly outperform March on hard combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for $t$-Core Partitions and Stanton's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A partition is a $t$-core partition if $t$ is not one of its hook lengths. Let $c_t(N)$ be the number of $t$-core partitions of $N$. In 1999, Stanton conjectured $c_t(N) \le c_{t+1}(N)$ if $4 \le t \ne N-1$. This was proved for $t$ fixed and $N$ sufficiently large by Anderson, and for small values of $t$ by Kim and Rouse. In this paper, we prove Stanton's conjecture in general. Our approach is to find a saddle point asymptotic formula for $c_t(N)$, valid in all ranges of $t$ and $N$. This includes the known asymptotic formulas for $c_t(N)$ as special cases, and shows that the behavior of $c_t(N)$ depends on how $t^2$ compares in size to $N$. For example, our formula implies that if $t^2 = \kappa N + o(t)$, then $c_t(N) = \frac{\exp\left(2\pi\sqrt{A N}\right)}{B N} (1 + o(1))$ for suitable constants $A$ and $B$ defined in terms of $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>The{N/D}-Conjecture for Nonresonant Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f,0}$ for homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $-{n\over d}$ is a root of $b_{f,0}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong topological monodromy conjecture for arrangements. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition.</description>

      <title>Hankel continued fractions and Hankel determinants for $q$-deformed metallic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix $n$ a positive integer. Take the $n$-th metallic number $\phi_n=\frac{n+\sqrt{n^2+4}}{2}$ (e.g. $\phi_1$ is the golden number) and let $\Phi_n(q)$ be its $q$-deformation in the sense of S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko. This is an algebraic continued fraction which admits an expansion into a Taylor series around $q=0$, with integral coefficients. By using the notion of Hankel continued fraction introduced by the first author in 2016 we determine explicitly the first $n+2$ sequences of shifted Hankel determinants of $\Phi_n$ and show that they satisfy the following properties:
  1) They are periodic and consist of $-1,0,1$ only.
  2) They satisfy a three-term Gale-Robinson recurrence, i.e. they form discrete integrable dynamical systems.
  3) They are all completely determined by the first sequence.
  This article thus validates a conjecture formulated by V. Ovsienko and the second author in a recent paper and establishes new connections between $q$-deformations of real numbers and sequences of Catalan or Motzkin numbers.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetric traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to illustrate the structure properties of the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with the set of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex paths) in one corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has certain frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $2(n-3)$. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the average case. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths increases according to $i\in [4, n]$ or keeps stable if it decreases from $i$ to $i+1\leq n$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge reaches its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For each ordinary edge out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in the optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$, respectively, in the average case. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq 2i_d$ where $i_d$ is the smallest number meeting the condition $\frac{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-2)(i_d-3)}{(n-2)(n-3) - (i_d-1)(i_d-2)} \geq \sqrt{1 + \frac{2}{i_d(i_d+1)}}$ and $i_d = O(n^{\frac{4}{7}})$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^2i_d^42^{2i_d})$ time using dynamic programming. The experiments are executed to verify these findings with the benchmark $TSP$ instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a gentle algebra. For every collection of string and band diagrammes, we consider the constructible subset of the variety of representations containing all modules with this underlying diagramme. We study degenerations of such sets. We show that these sets are defined by vectors of integers which we call $h$-vectors and which are related to a restricted version of the hom-order. We provide combinatorial criteria for the existence of a degeneration, involving the removal of an arrow or the resolving of a type of configuration called "reaching".</description>

      <title>Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first 1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and the maximum one-step error correction capability.</description>

      <title>Motivic Classes of Isotropic Degeneracy Loci and Symmetric Orbit Closures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for computing the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of degeneracy loci, especially those coming from the symplectic and odd orthogonal Grassmannians. The Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson classes, K-theory classes, and Cappell--Shaneson L-classes arise as specializations of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes. Our result is the analogue of the result of Anderson--Chen--Tarasca for the degeneracy loci from the ordinary Grassmannians. As applications, we obtain the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of orthogonal and symplectic orbit closures in flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Threshold graphs are globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization typically require every node to connect to sufficiently many neighbors, which in turn enforces rather homogeneous degree sequences and highly dense graphs. In this work, we identify threshold graphs as a class of graphs that lie outside this regime yet nevertheless exhibit global synchronization. More precisely, connected threshold graphs realize all admissible edge densities ranging from \(2/n\) to \(1\), and their degree sequences are maximally left-skewed among all graphs with the same edge density, when ordered in nonincreasing order. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Polynomials of Calabi Yau Hypersurfaces in Toric Varieties and Lattice Points in Polytope Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

      <title>On difference sets of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. Fish asked in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453] whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that $k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}.$ Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that if $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ is any finite sequence in $\mathbb{N},$ then there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $k \cdot MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\},$ where $MT\left(\langle a_j \rangle_{j=1}^m, \langle x_n\rangle_{n}\right)$ denotes the milliken-Taylor configuration generated by the sequences $\langle a_j\rangle_{j=1}^m$ and $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.</description>

      <title>Frame eversion and contextual geometric rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rigidity results describing contextually-constrained maps defined on Grassmannians and manifolds of ordered independent line tuples in finite-dimensional vector or Hilbert spaces. One statement in the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry classifies maps between full Grassmannians of two $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, $n\ge 3$, preserving dimension and lattice operations for pairs with commuting orthogonal projections, as precisely those induced by semilinear injections unique up to scaling.
  In a different but related direction, denote the manifolds of ordered orthogonal (linearly-independent) $n$-tuples of lines in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $V$ by $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(V)$ (respectively $\mathbb{F}(V)$) and, for partitions $\pi$ of the set $\{1..n\}$, call two tuples $\pi$-linked if the spans along $\pi$-blocks agree. A Wigner-style rigidity theorem proves that the symmetric maps $\mathbb{F}^{\perp}(\mathbb{C}^n)\to \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, $n\ge 3$ respecting $\pi$-linkage are precisely those induced by semilinear injections, hence by linear or conjugate-linear maps if also assumed measurable. On the other hand, in the $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{C}^n)$-defined analogue the only other possibility is a qualitatively new type of purely-contextual-global symmetry transforming a tuple $(\ell_i)_i$ of lines into $\left(\left(\bigoplus_{j\ne i}\ell_j\right)^{\perp}\right)_i$.</description>
