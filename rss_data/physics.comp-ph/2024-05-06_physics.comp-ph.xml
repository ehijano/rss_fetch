      <title>cuPSS: a package for pseudo-spectral integration of stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large part of modern research, especially in the broad field of complex systems, relies on the numerical integration of PDEs, with and without stochastic noise. This is usually done with eiher in- house made codes or external packages like MATLAB, Mathematica, Fenicsx, OpenFOAM, Dedalus, and others. These packages rarely offer a good combination of speed, generality, and the option to easily add stochasticity to the system, while in-house codes depend on certain expertise to obtain good performance, and are usually written for each specific use case, sacrificing modularity and reusability. This paper introduces a package written in CUDA C++, thus enabling by default gpu acceleration, that performs pseudo-spectral integration of generic stochastic PDEs in flat lattices in one, two and three dimensions. This manuscript describes how the basic functionality of cuPSS, with an example and benchmarking, showing that cuPSS offers a considerable improvement in speed over other popular finite-difference and spectral solvers.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for multiple scattering in one-dimensional waveguides with small inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new model to approximate the wave response of waveguides containing an arbitrary number of small inclusions. The theory is developed to consider any one-dimensional waveguide (longitudinal, flexural, shear, torsional waves or a combination of them by mechanical coupling), containing small inclusions with different material and/or sectional properties. The exact problem is modelled through the formalism of generalised functions, with the Heaviside function accounting for the discontinuous jump in different sectional properties of the inclusions. For asymptotically small inclusions, the exact solution is shown to be equivalent to the Green's function. We hypothesize that these expressions are also valid when the size of the inclusions are small in comparison to the wavelength, allowing us to approximate small inhomogeneities as regular perturbations to the empty-waveguide (the homogeneous waveguide in the absence of scatterers) as point source terms. By approximating solutions through the Green's function, the multiple scattering problem is considerably simplified, allowing us to develop a general methodology in which the solution is expressed for any model for any elastic waveguide. The advantage of our approach is that, by expressing the constitutive equations in first order form as a matrix, the solutions can be expressed in matrix form; therefore, it is trivial to consider models with more degrees of freedom and to arrive at solutions to multiple scattering problems independent of the elastic model used. The theory is validated with two numerical examples, where we perform an error analysis to demonstrate the validity of the approximate solutions, and we propose a parameter quantifying the expected errors in the approximation dependent upon the parameters of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>A Massively Parallel Performance Portable Free-space Spectral Poisson Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vico et al. (2016) suggest a fast algorithm for computing volume potentials, beneficial to fields with problems requiring the solution of Poisson's equation with free-space boundary conditions, such as the beam and plasma physics communities. Currently, the standard method for solving the free-space Poisson equation is the algorithm of Hockney and Eastwood (1988), which is second order in convergence at best. The algorithm proposed by Vico et al. converges spectrally for sufficiently smooth functions i.e. faster than any fixed order in the number of grid points. In this paper, we implement a performance portable version of the traditional Hockney-Eastwood and the novel Vico-Greengard Poisson solver as part of the IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) library. For sufficiently smooth source functions, the Vico-Greengard algorithm achieves higher accuracy than the Hockney-Eastwood method with the same grid size, reducing the computational demands of high resolution simulations since one could use coarser grids to achieve them. More concretely, to get a relative error of $10^{-4}$ between the numerical and analytical solution, one requires only $16^3$ grid points in the former, but $128^3$ in the latter, more than a 99% memory footprint reduction. Additionally, we propose an algorithmic improvement to the Vico-Greengard method which further reduces its memory footprint. This is particularly important for GPUs which have limited memory resources, and should be taken into account when selecting numerical algorithms for performance portable codes. Finally, we showcase performance through GPU and CPU scaling studies on the Perlmutter (NERSC) supercomputer, with efficiencies staying above 50% in the strong scaling case.</description>

      <title>Projected gradient descent algorithm for $\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with $\textit{ab initio}$ crystal structure relaxation under a fixed unit cell volume, which is a step in calculating the static equations of state and forms the basis of thermodynamic property calculations for materials. The task can be formulated as an energy minimization with a determinant constraint. Widely used line minimization-based methods (e.g., conjugate gradient method) lack both efficiency and convergence guarantees due to the nonconvex nature of the feasible region as well as the significant differences in the curvatures of the potential energy surface with respect to atomic and lattice components. To this end, we propose a projected gradient descent algorithm named PANBB. It is equipped with (i) search direction projections onto the tangent spaces of the nonconvex feasible region for lattice vectors, (ii) distinct curvature-aware initial trial step sizes for atomic and lattice updates, and (iii) a nonrestrictive line minimization criterion as the stopping rule for the inner loop. It can be proved that PANBB favors theoretical convergence to equilibrium states. Across a benchmark set containing 223 structures from various categories, PANBB achieves average speedup factors of approximately 1.41 and 1.45 over the conjugate gradient method and direct inversion in the iterative subspace implemented in off-the-shelf simulation software, respectively. Moreover, it normally converges on all the systems, manifesting its unparalleled robustness. As an application, we calculate the static equations of state for the high-entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi, which remains elusive owing to 160 atoms representing both chemical and magnetic disorder and the strong local lattice distortion. The results are consistent with the previous calculations and are further validated by experimental thermodynamic data.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the prediction performance of a Convolutional Neural Network evaluating the surface elastic energy of a strained film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Deep Learning approach is devised to estimate the elastic energy density $\rho$ at the free surface of an undulated stressed film. About 190000 arbitrary surface profiles h(x) are randomly generated by Perlin noise and paired with the corresponding elastic energy density profiles $\rho(x)$, computed by a semi-analytical Green's function approximation, suitable for small-slope morphologies. The resulting dataset and smaller subsets of it are used for the training of a Fully Convolutional Neural Network. The trained models are shown to return quantitative predictions of $\rho$, not only in terms of convergence of the loss function during training, but also in validation and testing, with better results in the case of the larger dataset. Extensive tests are performed to assess the generalization capability of the Neural Network model when applied to profiles with localized features or assigned geometries not included in the original dataset. Moreover, its possible exploitation on domain sizes beyond the one used in the training is also analyzed in-depth. The conditions providing a one-to-one reproduction of the ground-truth $\rho(x)$ profiles computed by the Green's approximation are highlighted along with critical cases. The accuracy and robustness of the deep-learned $\rho(x)$ are further demonstrated in the time-integration of surface evolution problems described by simple partial differential equations of evaporation/condensation and surface diffusion.</description>

      <title>MACE: A Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for a even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping cascaded random matrix models: correlations in permutations of matrix products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory is a useful tool in the study of the physics of multiple scattering systems, often striking a balance between computation speed and physical rigour. Propagation of waves through thick disordered media, as arises in for example optical scattering or electron transport, typically necessitates cascading of multiple random matrices drawn from an underlying ensemble for thin media, greatly increasing computational burden. Here we propose a dual pool based bootstrapping approach to speed up statistical studies of scattering in thick random media. We examine how potential matrix reuse in a pool based approach can impact statistical estimates of population averages. Specifically, we discuss how both bias and additional variance in the sample mean estimator are introduced through bootstrapping. In the diffusive scattering regime, the extra estimator variance is shown to originate from samples in which cascaded transfer matrices are permuted matrix products. Through analysis of the combinatorics and cycle structure of permutations we quantify the resulting correlations. Proofs of several analytic formulae enumerating the frequency with which correlations of different strengths occur are derived. Extension to the ballistic regime is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a compact but general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the bases of adiabatic electronic states and position states of nuclei, we make careful consideration of nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) terms between adiabatic states. It is clarified that the conventional use of NDC terms evaluated for an adiabatic electronic state in the textbook expression for the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate implicitly invokes an additional approximation that ignores non-orthogonality of adiabatic states at different geometries. Thus, we derive a well-defined FGR rate expression based on a quasi-adiabatic approximation that explicitly uses the adiabatic states and NDC terms evaluated at the minimum potential energy state of the initial adiabatic states. We then clarify conditions and approximations leading to the modeling of all the nuclear degrees of freedom as a set of harmonic oscillators, and then derive a closed form FGR rate expression while accounting for the non-Condon effects due to momenta in NDC terms explicitly. The resulting rate expression includes terms due to quadratic contribution of NDC terms and also their couplings to Franck-Condon modes. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and a broad Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression.</description>

      <title>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Optical spectra of silver clusters and nanoparticles of all sizes from the TDDFT+U method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localized surface-plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of coinage-metal clusters and nanoparticles provide the basis for a great number of applications, the conception and necessary optimization of which require precise theoretical description and understanding. However, for the size range from clusters of a few atoms through nanoparticles of a few nanometers, where quantum effects and atomistic structure play a significant role, none of the methods employed to date has been able to provide high-quality spectra for all sizes. The main problem is the description of the filled shells of d electrons which influence the optical response decisively. In the present work we show that the DFT+U method, employed with real-time time-dependent density-functional theory calculations (RT-TDDFT), provides spectra in good agreement with experiment for silver clusters ranging from 4 to 923 atoms, the latter representing a nanoparticle with a diameter of 3 nm. Both the electron-hole-type discrete spectra of the smallest clusters and the broad plasmon resonances of the larger sizes are obtained. All calculations have been carried out using the same value of the effective U parameter that has been found to provide good results in bulk silver. The agreement with experiment for all sizes shows that the U parameter is surprisingly transferable. Our results open the pathway for TDDFT calculations of many practically relevant systems including clusters coupled to bio-molecules or to other nano-objects.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of vortex memory system driven by edge-current and boundary magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a magnetohydrodynamic model is developed to study the dynamics of vortices driven by edge-current. Two modeled equations for fluid and magnetic field variables are each transformed into diffusion equation for vorticity and poisson equation for stream function. A numerical solution method is designed using a simplified Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM-D2Q5 scheme is utilized to obtain the numerical solutions for the fluid and magnetic field variables. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of systems employed in vortex-based memory systems is crucial for reliability and performance optimization. Based on this motivation, the effect of applied edge-current on the hydrodynamic and magnetic vortex configurations are analyzed through numerical simulations. The impact of the boundary magnetization is also conducted, by varying the strength of the magnetic field at the bottom boundary. The obtained graphical results provide some insights into the design and operation of vortex-based memory systems for next-generation data storage applications.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of the phase-space structures of KCN molecular system as a function of the vibrational energy using Lagrangian descriptors. For low energies, the motion is mostly regular around the absolute minimum of the potential energy surface. As the energy increases, the phase space combines regions with regular and chaotic motion, a difference that is well captured by the Lagrangian descriptors. We show that the dynamics is mostly governed by the invariant manifolds of the stretch periodic orbits located at the top of one of the energetic barriers of the system. Furthermore, we show a perfect agreement between the bifurcation theory and the differences observed in the phase-space structures as the vibrational energy is modified. The accuracy of our calculations is also assessed by explicit comparison with the invariant manifolds computed using linear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can process large sets of data generated from complex systems, which is ideal for classification tasks as often appeared in critical phenomena. Meanwhile ML techniques have been found effective in detecting critical points, or in a broader sense phase separation, and extracting critical exponents. But there are still many unsolved issues with the ML, one of which is the meaning of hidden variables of unsupervised learning. Some say that the hidden variables and the principal component may contain basic information regarding the order parameter of the system of interest, which sounds plausible but lacks evidence. This study aims at searching for evidence supporting the conjecture that the autoencoder's (AE) single latent variable and PCA's first principal component can only serve as signals related to particle density, which happens to be the order parameter of the non-equilibrium DP model. Indeed, in some phase transition (PT) models the order parameter is the particle density, whereas in some PT models it is not. Having conducted a certain degree of random shuffling on the DP configurations, which are then fed to the neural networks as input, we find that AE's single latent variable and PCA's first principal component can indeed represent particle density. It is found that shuffling does affect the size of maximum cluster in the system, which suggests that the second principal component of the PCA is related to the maximal cluster. This has been supported by changes in the correlation length of the transition system with variations in the shuffle ratio.</description>

      <title>QuACK: Accelerating Gradient-Based Quantum Optimization with Koopman Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimization, a key application of quantum computing, has traditionally been stymied by the linearly increasing complexity of gradient calculations with an increasing number of parameters. This work bridges the gap between Koopman operator theory, which has found utility in applications because it allows for a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, and natural gradient methods in quantum optimization, leading to a significant acceleration of gradient-based quantum optimization. We present Quantum-circuit Alternating Controlled Koopman learning (QuACK), a novel framework that leverages an alternating algorithm for efficient prediction of gradient dynamics on quantum computers. We demonstrate QuACK's remarkable ability to accelerate gradient-based optimization across a range of applications in quantum optimization and machine learning. In fact, our empirical studies, spanning quantum chemistry, quantum condensed matter, quantum machine learning, and noisy environments, have shown accelerations of more than 200x speedup in the overparameterized regime, 10x speedup in the smooth regime, and 3x speedup in the non-smooth regime. With QuACK, we offer a robust advancement that harnesses the advantage of gradient-based quantum optimization for practical benefits.</description>

      <title>Principal deuterium Hugoniot via Quantum Monte Carlo and $\Delta$-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the principal deuterium Hugoniot for pressures up to $150$ GPa, using Machine Learning potentials (MLPs) trained with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) energies, forces and pressures. In particular, we adopted a recently proposed workflow based on the combination of Gaussian kernel regression and $\Delta$-learning. By fully taking advantage of this method, we explicitly considered finite-temperature electrons in the dynamics, whose effects are highly relevant for temperatures above $10$ kK. The Hugoniot curve obtained by our MLPs shows a good agreement with the most recent experiments, particularly in the region below 60 GPa. At larger pressures, our Hugoniot curve is slightly more compressible than the one yielded by experiments, whose uncertainties generally increase, however, with pressure. Our work demonstrates that QMC can be successfully combined with $\Delta$-learning to deploy reliable MLPs for complex extended systems across different thermodynamic conditions, by keeping the QMC precision at the computational cost of a mean-field calculation.</description>

      <title>Koopman neural operator as a mesh-free solver of non-linear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lacking of analytic solutions of diverse partial differential equations (PDEs) gives birth to a series of computational techniques for numerical solutions. Although numerous latest advances are accomplished in developing neural operators, a kind of neural-network-based PDE solver, these solvers become less accurate and explainable while learning long-term behaviors of non-linear PDE families. In this paper, we propose the Koopman neural operator (KNO), a new neural operator, to overcome these challenges. With the same objective of learning an infinite-dimensional mapping between Banach spaces that serves as the solution operator of the target PDE family, our approach differs from existing models by formulating a non-linear dynamic system of equation solution. By approximating the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional operator governing all possible observations of the dynamic system, to act on the flow mapping of the dynamic system, we can equivalently learn the solution of a non-linear PDE family by solving simple linear prediction problems. We validate the KNO in mesh-independent, long-term, and5zero-shot predictions on five representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equation and the Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection) and three real dynamic systems (e.g., global water vapor patterns and western boundary currents). In these experiments, the KNO exhibits notable advantages compared with previous state-of-the-art models, suggesting the potential of the KNO in supporting diverse science and engineering applications (e.g., PDE solving, turbulence modelling, and precipitation forecasting).</description>

      <title>Space-dependent Aggregation of Stochastic Data-driven Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic Machine-Learning approach is developed for data-driven Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions of turbulent flows, with quantified model uncertainty. This is done by combining a Bayesian symbolic identification methodology for learning stochastic RANS model corrections for selected classes of flows (expert models), and a Mixture-of-Experts methodology that aggregates their predictions. The expert models are learned using the recently proposed SBL-SpaRTA algorithm, which generates sparse analytical expressions of the corrective terms with model parameters described by probability distributions. They outperform the baseline RANS model for flows similar to those used for training, but their generalization to different flows is not warranted. With the aim of quantifying the predictive uncertainty associated with the data-driven models while improving predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities, a space-dependent model aggregation technique (XMA) is then adopted. A gating function, which assigns each model a performance score (weight) based on a vector of local flow features, is trained alongside the expert models. The weights can be interpreted as the probability that a candidate model will outperform its competitors given the flow behavior at a given location. Predictions of unseen flows are formulated as a locally weighted average of the stochastic solutions of the expert models. A prediction uncertainty estimate is obtained by propagating the models' posterior parameter distributions and by evaluating the inter-model prediction variance. The expectancy of the XMA prediction is significantly more accurate than the baseline deterministic solution and the individual solutions of the experts for well-documented benchmark flows not included in the training set, while providing consistent estimates of the predictive variance.</description>

      <title>Laser-Plasma Ion Beam Booster Based on Hollow-Channel Magnetic Vortex Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven ion acceleration provides ultra-short, high-charge, low-emittance beams, which are desirable for a wide range of high-impact applications. Yet after decades of research, a significant increase in maximum ion energy is still needed. This work introduces a quality-preserving staging concept for ultra-intense ion bunches that is seamlessly applicable from the non-relativistic plasma source to the relativistic regime. Full 3D particle-in-cell simulations prove robustness and capture of a high-charge proton bunch, suitable for readily available and near-term laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Weak effects of electron-phonon interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of wurtzite GaN with high electron concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has great potential for high-frequency and high-power applications due to its excellent electrical and thermal transport properties. However, enhancing the performance of GaN-based power electronics relies on heavy doping. Previous studies showed that electron-phonon interactions have strong effects on the lattice thermal conductivity of GaN due to the Fr\"ohlich interaction. Surprisingly, our investigation reveals weak effects of electron-phonon interactions on the lattice thermal conductivity of n-type GaN at ultra-high electron concentrations and the impact of the Fr\"ohlich interaction can be ignored. The small phonon-electron scattering rate is attributed to the limited scattering channels, quantified by the Fermi surface nesting function. In contrast, there is a significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity of p-type GaN at high hole concentrations due to the relatively larger Fermi surface nesting function. Meanwhile, as p-type GaN has relatively smaller electron-phonon matrix elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity is still weaker than that observed in p-type silicon. Our work provides a deep understanding of thermal transport in doped GaN and the conclusions can be further extended to other wide-bandgap semiconductors, including $\beta$-Ga2O3, AlN, and ZnO.</description>

      <title>SCINE -- Software for Chemical Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The software for chemical interaction networks (SCINE) project aims at pushing the frontier of quantum chemical calculations on molecular structures to a new level. While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them e.g., as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability. All components of the software have been made available open source and free of charge.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Simple and efficient methods for local structural analysis in polydisperse hard disk systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium statistical physics, quantifying the nearest (and higher-order) neighbors and free volumes of particles in many-body systems is crucial to elucidating the origin of macroscopic collective phenomena, such as glass/granular jamming transitions and various aspects of the behavior of active matter. However, conventional techniques (based on a fixed-distance cutoff or the Voronoi construction) have mainly been applied to equilibrated, homogeneous, and monodisperse particle systems. In this paper, we implement simple and efficient methods for local structure analysis in nonequilibrium, inhomogeneous, and polydisperse hard disk systems. We show how these novel methods can overcome the difficulties encountered by conventional techniques, as well as demonstrating some applications.</description>
