      <title>Observation of Blood Flow in Major Neck Vessels Modulated 1 by Physiological Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large neck vessels (carotid artery and internal jugular vein, IJV) offer a unique opportunity to monitor hemodynamics non-invasively by optical means. The primary shortcoming of past work has been the focus on healthy volunteers in normal physiological conditions and well-controlled environments. To drive the technology closer to the bedside, testing is required under more re-alistic conditions, including in pathologies and real-world environments (e.g., similar toICU or emergency care settings). The primary goal of the current work was to extend the range of physiological maneuvers for blood flow modulation by introducing new maneuvers and ob-serving PPG response to them. The data from the necks of two healthy volunteers in a supine position were collected by clinical PPG and in-house built PPG sensors, accompanied by ECG signal collection. Seven maneuvers (abdominojugular test, breath holding, Valsalva, proximal occlusion of right IJV, distal occlusion of right IJV, proximal occlusion of left IJV, distal occlusion of left IJV) were performed in sequence with 1 min allocated for each maneuver. The 1 min was split into three segments: baseline (15 s), experiment (15 s), and recovery (30 s). Thus, the overall du-ration of the experiment was 7 min. AC amplitude from clinical PPG, DC amplitudes from in-house built PPG, and ECG signal were compared during all seven physiological maneuvers. Newly proposed maneuvers (Valsalva and IJV occlusions) demonstrated modulation of blood flow, which was more significant than previously reported maneuvers (abdominojugular test and breath holding). The proposed physiological maneuvers demonstrate high potential as instruments for modulating blood flow in major neck vessels.</description>

      <title>Whole body dynamic PET kernel reconstruction using nonnegative matrix factorization features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel reconstruction is a method that reduces noise in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) by exploiting spatial correlations in the PET image. Although this method works well for large anatomical regions with relatively slow kinetics, whole body PET reconstruction with the kernel method can produce suboptimal results in regions with fast kinetics and high contrast. In this work we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve reconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels features using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank selection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between voxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide range of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high temporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and [18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in different settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was improved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method. In real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys presented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our proposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain kinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function ([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and [18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix compared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and maintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the traditional kernel method.</description>

      <title>Positronium Imaging: History, Current Status, and Future Perspectives</title>

Abstract: Positronium imaging was recently proposed to image the properties of positronium atoms in the patient body. Positronium properties depend on the size of intramolecular voids and oxygen concentration; therefore, they deliver information different and complementary to the anatomic, morphological, and metabolic images. Thus far, the mean ortho-positronium lifetime imaging has been at the center of research interest. The first ex vivo and in vivo positronium lifetime images of humans have been demonstrated with the dedicated J-PET scanner enabling simultaneous registration of annihilation photons and prompt gamma from ${\beta^{+} \gamma}$ emitters. Annihilation photons are used to reconstruct the annihilation place and time while prompt gamma is used to reconstruct the time of positronium formation. This review describes recent achievements in the translation of positronium imaging into clinics. The first measurements of positronium lifetime in humans with commercial PET scanners modernized to register triple coincidences are reported. The in vivo observations of differences in ortho-positronium lifetime between tumor and healthy tissues and between different oxygen concentrations are discussed. So far, the positronium lifetime measurements in humans were completed with clinically available ${^{68}\text{Ga}}$, ${^{82}\text{Rb}}$, and ${^{124}\text{I}}$ radionuclides. Status and challenges in developing positronium imaging on a way to a clinically useful procedure are presented and discussed.</description>
