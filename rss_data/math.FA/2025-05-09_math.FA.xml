      <title>Symmetry, Scaling, and Optimal Time-Frequency Concentration: Minimising the Heisenberg Uncertainty in Piecewise-Polynomial and Wavelet Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a hierarchy of function classes defined on a fixed compact interval, along with tailored uncertainty operators. We establish key properties of the associated uncertainty product, showing that it is invariant under scale and translation transformations. Notably, we prove that the infimum of the uncertainty within the asymmetric class is attained in the even subclass. Within two specific wavelet dictionaries, we identify the tent function as the unique minimiser of the time-frequency uncertainty, achieving a value of $U = \frac{3}{10}$. Additionally, we analyse the family of $p$-fold self-convolutions of the rectangle function, $\operatorname{rect}^{\{p\}}$, demonstrating that the uncertainty decreases monotonically towards the Heisenberg bound $ \frac{1}{4} $ as $p \to \infty$. These findings unify and explain various empirical observations from the literature on adaptive wavelet design and Gabor frame stability, and suggest a principled approach to constructing dictionaries with provably optimal joint localisation properties.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal closed prime ideals in a unital commutative Banach algebra are accessible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that in a commutative unital Banach algebra, every non-maximal closed prime ideal is accessible. Specifically, it can be represented as the intersection of all closed ideals of the algebra that properly contain it. Consequently, all derivations and epimorphisms on commutative unital semi-prime Banach algebras are continuous. Moreover, any separating ideal in a commutative unital Banach algebra is nilpotent and, therefore, a nil ideal.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Carleson Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spanning properties of Carleson systems and prove a recent conjecture on frame subsequences of Carleson frames. In particular, we show that if $\{T^k\varphi\}_{k=0}^\infty$ is a Carleson frame, then every subsequence of the form $\{T^{Nk+j_k}\varphi\}_{k=0}^\infty$ where $N\in\mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq j_k &lt; N$ is also a frame.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates of fractional heat semigroups related with uniformly elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L = -{\rm div}( A(x) \cdot \nabla ) + V(x)$ be a second-order uniformly elliptic operator on $\mathbb{ R }^{n}$ $(n\geq 3)$, where $A(x)$ is a real symmetric matrix satisfying standard ellipticity conditions, and $V$ is a nonnegative potential belonging to the reverse H\"older class. For $ \alpha \in (0,1) $, we study regularity estimates of the fractional heat semigroups $ \{ exp (-tL^ {\alpha } )\} _ { t &gt; 0 }$, via the subordination formula and the fundamental solution of the associated uniformly parabolic equation $ \partial_t u + Lu = 0 $. This approach avoids the use of Fourier transforms and is applicable to second-order differential operators whose heat kernels satisfy Gaussian upper bounds. As an application, we characterize the Campanato-type space $\Lambda_{ L , \gamma } \left( \mathbb{R}^n \right)$ via the fractional heat semigroups $\{exp ( - t L ^ {\alpha } ) \} _ { t &gt; 0 } $.</description>

      <title>An Active Contour Model for Silhouette Vectorization using B\'ezier Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette vectorization using cubic B\'ezier curves. Among the end points of the B\'ezier curves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation of the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the B\'ezier curves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the location of the B\'ezier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent vectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the B\'ezier curve parameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization obtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly reduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its vectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for comparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the B\'ezier curves by reducing their lengths.</description>

      <title>Fourier-based Inversion of Partial X-ray Transforms in $n$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two theorems describing analytic left-inverses of partial X-ray transforms. The first theorem concerns X-ray data collected with an arbitrary distribution of parallel projections; it contains a convolution-backprojection formula and a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is sufficient. The second theorem concerns X-ray data collected with a cone-beam; it contains a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is amenable to this method. The cone-beam method is usable for X-ray source point loci that are multidimensional and that adequately surround the reconstruction support; it supports data collected with a flat 2D detector of finite size.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behaviour of the Ces\`aro operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of orbits $(T^nx)_{n\ge0}$ of the classical Ces\`aro operator $T$ for sequences $x$ in the Banach space $c$ of convergent sequences. We give new non-probabilistic proofs, based on the Katznelson-Tzafriri theorem and one of its quantified variants, of results which characterise the set of sequences $x\in c$ that lead to convergent orbits and, for sequences satisfying a simple additional condition, we provide a rate of convergence. These results are then shown, again by operator-theoretic techniques, to be optimal in different ways. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the Ces\`aro operator defined on spaces of continuous functions, establishing new and improved results in this setting, too.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Weighted shifts on weighted Bergman and Dirichlet spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B_w$ and $F_w$ denote, respectively, the weighted backward and forward shift operators defined on the weighted Bergman space $A^p_{\phi}$, or the weighted Dirichlet space ${D}^p_{\phi}$ of the unit disc, where the weight function $\phi(z)$ is mostly radial. We first obtain sufficient conditions for $B_w$ and $F_w$ to be continuous on these spaces. For radial weights, we derive norm estimates for coefficient functionals on $A^p_{\phi}$ and $D^p_{\phi}$, and using those estimates we infer when the weighted shifts or their adjoints are hypercyclic and chaotic. We also deal with a non-radial case.</description>

      <title>Statistical field theory of random graphs with prescribed degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>
