      <title>Crystalline-Symmetry-Protected Majorana Modes in Coupled Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimalist architecture for achieving various crystalline-symmetry-protected Majorana modes in an array of coupled quantum dots. Our framework is motivated by the recent experimental demonstrations of two-site and three-site artificial Kitaev chains in a similar setup. We find that introducing a $\pi$-phase domain wall in the Kitaev chain leads to a pair of mirror-protected Majorana zero modes located at or near the junction. Joining two $\pi$-junctions into a closed loop, we can simulate two distinct classes of two-dimensional higher-order topological superconducting phases, both carrying symmetry-protected Majorana modes around the sample corners. As an extension of the $\pi$-junction, we further consider a general vertex structure where $n$ Kitaev chains meet, i.e., a Kitaev $n$-vertex. We prove that such an $n$-vertex, if respecting a dihedral symmetry group $D_n$, necessarily carries $n$ vertex-bound Majorana modes protected by the $D_n$ symmetry. Resilience of the junction and vertex Majorana bound states against disorder and correlation effects is also discussed. Our architecture paves the way for designing, constructing, and exploring a wide variety of artificial topological crystalline phases in experiments.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance in 3D-tilted square artificial spin ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices (ASIs) arranged in square formations have been explored from the perspective of reconfigurable magnonics. A new frontier in ASIs is their three-dimensional (3D) extension. Here, we numerically explore the ferromagnetic resonance of square ASIs as each nanomagnet is rotated out of plane into 3D ASIs, in which the vertex gap can be either kept constant or varying. We study both remanent and vortex configurations using a semi-analytical dynamic approach and micromagnetic simulations. We find that both methods show qualitative agreement of the main spectral features. However, there are important limitations. On one hand, the semi-analytical approach relies on a minimal model of the demag field, preventing exact predictions. On the other hand, micromagnetic simulations suffer from sufficient resolution, making the results grid-dependent and extremely slow. Regardless, both methods display tunability as a function of the tilt angle. These results showcase advantages and limitations of both methods and are promising to further our understanding of 3D ASI dynamics.</description>

      <title>Application of the Landauer-B\"uttiker method to the calculation of interlayer exchange coupling in closed ballistic multi-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication we study the behaviour of spin current components in a ballistic junction consisting of two semi-infinite leads and a scattering region composed of two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic metallic spacer. We then consider the system being gradually isolated from the leads, which we refer to as the transition from an open to a closed regime. As expected on physical grounds, charge and in-plane components vanish, but the out-of-plane spin current remains finite and gives rise to the oscillatory interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between the magnets. We show that the out-of-plane spin current reduces to a set of peaks in momentum space, which correspond to discrete energy eigenstates of the closed system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression for the IEC in terms of spin current for an open system reduces to an expression in the closed system, which corresponds exactly to the definition of IEC in terms of energy difference.</description>

      <title>Flat band excitons and quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the excitons in flat band systems. Quantum metric plays a central role in determining the properties of single exciton excitation as well as the exciton condensate. While the electrons and holes are extremely heavy in flat bands, the excitons (boundstate of an electron-hole pair) could be light and mobile. In particular, we show that the inverse of exciton's effective mass tensor is proportional to the quantum metric tensor. Meanwhile, the flat band excitons have a finite size, lower bounded by the trace of the quantum metric tensor. Given the properties of single exciton excitation, one can argue for the formation of exciton condensate. Because of the quantum metric, the exciton condensate can support dissipationless counterflow supercurrent, implying the stability of exciton condensate.</description>

      <title>Orbital Edelstein effect from the gradient of a scalar potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) that originates from a particular inversion symmetry breaking mechanism: an asymmetric scalar potential. We compute OEE of this kind with the help of the Kubo formula in the diffusive regime for a parabolic band Hamiltonian. We also present a qualitative derivation of the effect. Both approaches give the same result. This result does not rely on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and scales as a cube of the momentum relaxation time. In sufficiently clean large systems with weak SOC, OEE of this nature should exceed the spin Edelstein effect by orders of magnitude. It may also provide an alternative interpretation for some experiments concerning the spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Reciprocity in Orbital-Charge-Coupled Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled transport of the charge and orbital angular momentum of electrons is at the heart of orbitronics. Here, we discuss the reciprocal relation between the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects (OHEs) in thin films. We argue that the conventional orbital current is ill-defined as it does not satisfy the reciprocal relation owing to non-conservation of the orbital angular momentum. We resolve the problem by adopting the definition of the so-called \emph{proper} orbital current, which is directly related to orbital accumulation. We prove the reciprocal relation between the \emph{global} response of orbital and charge currents. However, we show that their \emph{local} distributions are generally different, especially due to gigantic contributions at surfaces, which may lead to unintuitive results when charge and orbital currents are locally measured. We demonstrate our predictions by first-principles calculations on W(110) and Pt(111) thin films. In W(110), the direct and inverse OHEs are severely non-reciprocal locally in each layer although the total responses are exactly reciprocal. Interestingly, the SHEs are almost reciprocal locally in each layer. On the other hand, in Pt(111), both OHEs and SHEs are locally non-reciprocal, which we attribute to the pronounced spin-orbit interaction. We propose that the locally distinct responses may be used to distinguish the spin and orbital currents in experiments.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Majorana Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize Majorana fermions having novel physical features has been developed as a key while difficult task in topological superconductor. Here we have proposed another platform to generate Majorana zero modes (MZMs), which is constructed by a single opened circular helix molecules (CHM) coupled with a s-wave superconductor (with magnetic field) or by an interlinked-CHMs chain coupled with a phase-bias s-wave superconducting heterostructure (without any magnetic field). The MZMs achieved here are tightly associated with the structural chirality in CHMs. Importantly, the left and right handedness may result in completely opposite Majorana polarization (MP), and the local MP is associated to the chiraliy-induced spin polarization. These properties provides us multiple effective ways to detect and regulate the MZMs by using the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and the related spin-polarized currents in chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Critical fluctuation and noise spectra in two-dimensional Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical fluctuations play a fundamental role in determining the spin orders for low-dimensional quantum materials, especially for recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) magnets. Here we employ the quantum decoherence imaging technique utilizing nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to explore the critical magnetic fluctuations and the associated temporal spin noise in van der Waals magnet $\rm{Fe_{3}GeTe_{2}}$. We show that the critical fluctuation contributes to a random magnetic field characterized by the noise spectra, which can be changed dramatically near the critical temperature $T_c$. A theoretical model to describe this phenomenon is developed, showing that the spectral density is characterized by a $1/f$ noise near the $T_c$, while away from this point it behaves like a white noise. The crossover at a certain temperature between these two situations is determined by changing of the distance between the sample and the diamond. This work provides a new way to study critical fluctuation and to extract some of the critical exponents, which may greatly deepen our understanding of criticality in a wide range of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Excitations in Ferromagnetically Coupled Spin-1 Nanographenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for high-spin building blocks to form covalently bonded 1D or 2D materials with controlled magnetic interactions, $\pi$-electron magnetism provides an ideal framework to engineer large ferromagnetic interactions between nanographenes. As a first step in this direction, we investigate the spin properties of ferromagnetically coupled triangulenes, triangular nanographenes with spin $S = 1$. Combining in-solution synthesis of rationally designed molecular precursors and on-surface synthesis, we achieve covalently bonded $S = 2$ triangulene dimers and $S = 3$ trimers on Au(111). Starting from the triangulene dimer, we thoroughly characterize its low-energy magnetic excitations using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). IETS reveals conductance steps identified as a quintet to triplet excitation, and a zero-bias peak stemming from higher-order spin-spin scattering of the 5-fold degenerate ferromagnetic ground state. The Heisenberg picture captures the relevant parameters of inter-triangulene ferromagnetic exchange, and its successful extension to the larger $S = 3$ system confirms the model's accuracy. We expect that the addition of ferromagnetically coupled building blocks to the toolbox of magnetic nanographenes opens new opportunities to design carbon materials with complex magnetic ground states.</description>

      <title>Steady-state properties of multi-orbital systems using quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise dynamical characterization of quantum impurity models with multiple interacting orbitals is challenging. In quantum Monte Carlo methods, this is embodied by sign problems. A dynamical sign problem makes it exponentially difficult to simulate long times. A multi-orbital sign problem generally results in a prohibitive computational cost for systems with multiple impurity degrees of freedom even in static equilibrium calculations. Here, we present a numerically exact inchworm method that simultaneously alleviates both sign problems, enabling simulation of multi-orbital systems directly in the equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady-state. The method combines ideas from the recently developed steady-state inchworm Monte Carlo framework [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 186301 (2023)] with other ideas from the equilibrium multi-orbital inchworm algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 206405 (2020)]. We verify our method by comparison with analytical limits and numerical results from previous methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Topology in Lattice Models without Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a fundamental lattice model used to study topological physics. Here, we propose a new versatile one-dimensional (1D) lattice model that extends beyond the SSH model. Our 1D model breaks chiral symmetry and has generalized topology characterized by a projected winding number $W_{1D,P}=1$. When this model is extended to 2D, it can generate a second-order topological insulator (SOTI) phase. The generalized topology of the SOTI phase is protected by a pair of opposite winding numbers $W_{2D,P}^{\pm}=\pm1$, which count the opposite phase windings of a projected vortex and antivortex pair defined in the manifold of the entire parameter space. Thus, the topology of our models is robust and the end (corner) modes are independent of the selection of unit cells and boundary configurations. More significantly, we demonstrate that the model is very general and can be inherently realized in many categories of crystalline materials such as BaHCl.</description>

      <title>Heteroatomic Andreev molecule in a superconducting island-double quantum dot hybrid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors (SCs) hold great promise for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, however, their experimental realization is very challenging. Recently, superconducting artificial molecules (Andreev molecules) have opened new avenues to engineer topological superconducting materials. In this work, we demonstrate a heteroatomic Andreev molecule, where two normal artificial atoms realized by quantum dots (QDs) are coupled by a superconducting island (SCI). We show that the two normal atoms strongly hybridize and form a 3-electron-based molecular state. Our density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations explain quantitatively the robust binding of electrons. The tunability of the structure allows us to drive a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic Andreev molecular state to a heteroatomic Andreev molecule with ferromagnetically coupled QDs using simple electrical gating.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence of a long-lifetime exciton-polariton condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum information science has made significant progress, leading to a multitude of quantum protocols for the most diverse applications. States carrying resources such as quantum coherence are a key component for these protocols. In this study, we optimize the quantum coherence of a nonresonantly excited exciton-polariton condensate of long living polaritons by minimizing the condensate's interaction with the surrounding reservoir of excitons and free carriers. By combining experimental phase space data with a displaced thermal state model, we observe how quantum coherence builds up as the system is driven above the condensation threshold. Our findings demonstrate that a spatial separation between the condensate and the reservoir enhances the state's maximum quantum coherence directly beyond the threshold. These insights pave the way for integrating polariton systems into hybrid quantum devices and advancing applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Large-Amplitude, Easy-Plane Spin-Orbit Torque Oscillators Driven by Out-of-Plane Spin Current: A Micromagnetic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin torque oscillators are spintronic devices that generate a periodic output signal from a non-periodic input, making them promising candidates for applications like microwave communications and neuromorphic computing. However, traditional spin torque oscillators suffer from a limited precessional cone angle and thermal stability, as well as a need for an applied bias magnetic field. We use micromagnetic simulations to demonstrate a novel spin torque oscillator that relies on spin-orbit effects in ferromagnets to overcome these limitations. The key mechanism behind this oscillator is the generation of an out-of-plane spin current, in which both the spin flow and the spin orientation are out-of-plane. The torque from this spin current enables easy-plane coherent magnetic precession with a large cone angle and high thermal stability over a micron-scale lateral area. Moreover, the precession occurs about an internal field in the free layer, thereby eliminating the need for an external bias field. We demonstrate the feasibility of an easy-plane spin-orbit torque oscillator at room temperature over a wide parameter space, including the ratio of the out-of-plane spin current to the conventional spin-Hall spin current, presenting exciting possibilities for this novel spintronic device.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Optical Hall Effect in 2D Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interplay between the geometric nature of Bloch electrons and transverse responses under strong field offers new opportunities for optoelectronic applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the strong-field response of Weyl Dirac nodes in bilayer T'-WTe2 using time-dependent first-principles formalism. The electron dynamics is explored focusing on the mid-infrared frequency, ranging from the perturbative to nonperturbative regime. In the nonperturbative regime, the high-harmonic generation (HHG) spectra under a strong field clearly exhibit a plateau and energy cutoffs for both longitudinal and anomalous Hall (transverse) currents, with the latter being due to the large interband Berry curvature of the Weyl-Dirac semimetal. For the longitudinal harmonics, the intraband contributions increase with intensity, resulting in a complex interplay between interband polarization and intraband motions. Remarkably, if we take a comprehensive all-band perspective enabled by time-dependent density functional calculations, the anomalous Hall responses are purely attributed to the interband processes, even in the nonperturbative regime, thus Hall HHG can be crucial to understand the carrier dynamics. Our findings suggest that HHG associated with the ultrafast strong-field driven electron dynamics holds immense potential for exploring the nonlinear high Hall responses in Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approximations of topological insulator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven approach to calculating tight-binding models for discrete coupled-mode systems is presented. Specifically, spectral and topological data is used to build an appropriate discrete model that accurately replicates these properties. This work is motivated by topological insulator systems that are often described by tight-binding models. The problem is formulated as the minimization of an appropriate residual (objective) function. Given bulk spectral data and a topological index (e.g. winding number), an appropriate discrete model is obtained to arbitrary precision. A nonlinear least squares method is used to determine the coefficients. The effectiveness of the scheme is highlighted against a Schr\"odinger equation with a periodic potential that can be described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation method for magnetoelastic coupling between surface acoustic waves and spin waves using electrical and optical measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling and hybridization of different elementary excitations leads to new functionalities. In phononics and spintronics, magnetoelastic coupling between Rayleigh-type surface acoustic wave (SAW) and spin wave (SW) has recently attracted much attention. Quantitatively evaluating and comparing the coupled system are essential to develop the study of the magnetoelastic SAW-SW coupling. So far, previous studies of SAW-SW coupling have employed a quantity called coupling strength. However, it is still challenging to compare the coupling strength values among studies fairly because the quantity depends on the device geometry and the applied magnetic field angle, which are not unified among the previous studies. Here, we focus on a practical constant composed of a magnetoelastic constant and a strain amplitude that depends only on the material properties. We demonstrate a versatile evaluation technique to evaluate the practical constant by combining electrical measurements and optical imaging. An essential part of the technique is an analysis that can be used under off-resonance conditions where SAW and SW resonance frequencies do not match. Existing analysis can only handle the case under on-resonance conditions. Our analysis makes it possible to observe the magnetoelastic couplings between SAW with resonance frequencies that can be imaged optically and SW with resonance frequencies in the gigahertz range. Our demonstrated technique, which uses electrical and optical measurements under off-resonance conditions, can significantly advance research on SAW-SW coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of single and multiple Floquet Majorana modes in one-dimensional Rashba nanowire and Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n\times 2e^{2}/h$ of summed conductance with $n$ being the number of modes~($0$ / $\pi$) located at one end of NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin accumulation carried by slow relaxons in chiral tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient conversion between charge currents and spin signals is crucial for realizing magnet-free spintronic devices. However, the strong spin-orbit coupling that enables such a conversion, causes rapid relaxation of spins, making them difficult to transport over large length scales. Here, we show that spin-momentum entanglement at the Fermi surface of chiral tellurium crystals leads to the appearance of slow collective relaxation modes. These modes, called relaxons, resemble the persistent spin helix, a collective spin-wave excitation with extended lifetime observed in quantum wells. The slow relaxons dominate the electrically generated spin and orbital angular momentum accumulation in tellurium and make it possible to combine a very high 50% conversion efficiency with a long spin lifetime. These results, obtained from the exact solution of the Boltzmann transport equation, show that chiral crystals can be used for highly efficient generation and transmission of spin signals over long distances in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of One-Dimensional Chiral Symmetric Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the topological classification of one-dimensional chiral symmetric interfaces embedded into a two-dimensional substrate. A proof of the validity of a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit evaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due to entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of the substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is done by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground state projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces erroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap closures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model of a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Current distribution and chirality in the regime of the quantized Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) is one of the most basic and, at the same time, astonishing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Despite its importance for metrology and fundamental physics, our microscopic understanding of the QHE is not yet complete. For decades, there has been a discussion about the current distribution inside a Hall bar for the case of a quantized Hall resistance. With the advent of quantum technology, the questions, if the current flows in compressible Landauer-B\"uttiker edge channels or in incompressible strips with varying geometry and whether the current flow is chiral or not, gain importance, because the quantum phase of each charge carrier depends on its exact pathway. In the present work, we compare multi-terminal current measurements in the regime of the QHE with model calculations in order to unravel the current density distribution in a Hall-bar device. We find, that the conjecture of chirality is justified for the plateaus of quantized Hall resistance, while in between plateaus the current density looses its chirality. The latter is described by the Drude model, which predicts a homogeneous current density for a sample with homogeneous mobility and carrier density.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary dimensions: non-Bloch band theory and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by a significant accumulation of eigenstates at system boundaries. While well-understood in one dimension via non-Bloch band theory, unraveling the NHSE in higher dimensions faces formidable challenges due to the diversity of open boundary conditions or lattice geometries and inevitable numerical errors. Key issues, including higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory, geometric dependency, spectral convergence and stability, and a complete classification of NHSE, remain elusive. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a geometry-adaptive non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions, through the lens of spectral potential. Our formulation accurately determines the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone for a given geometry in the thermodynamic limit (TDL), revealing their geometric dependencies. Furthermore, we systematically classify the NHSE into critical and non-reciprocal types using net winding numbers. In the critical case, we identify novel scale-free skin modes residing on the boundary. In the nonreciprocal case, the skin modes manifest in various forms, including normal or anomalous corner modes, boundary modes or scale-free modes. We reveal the non-convergence and instability of the non-Bloch spectra in the presence of scale-free modes and attribute it to the non-exchangeability of the zero-perturbation limit and the TDL. The instability drives the energy spectra towards the Amoeba spectra in the critical case. Our findings provide a unified non-Bloch band theory governing the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone in the TDL, offering a comprehensive understanding of NHSE in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Superlubric Brownian Motor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motors are nanoscale machines that utilize asymmetric physical interactions to generate directed motion in space. The operation mechanism relies on the random motion of nanoscale elements generated by thermal activation. On the other hand, structural superlubricity (SSL) refers to a state of nearly vanishing friction due to structural mismatch between sliding interfaces. Van-der-Waals layered materials, such as graphene are of particular interest in this regard as they exhibit atomically flat surfaces and weak interlayer interaction. In particular, the sliding barrier in these systems turned out to be extremely sensitive to temperature, leading to the observation of thermal lubrication at elevated temperatures. Herein, the unique combination of a carefully designed tilted periodic potential landscape and virtually zero friction in incommensurate 2D layered systems are used to realize a mesoscopic superlubric Brownian machine. In particular, we perform mechanical shearing of superlubric graphite contacts to examine the influence of velocity on friction and adhesion. Our results show that while friction is virtually independent of velocity below 2500 nm*sec-1, the conservative adhesion force increases by ~ 10 % with respect to the lowest measured velocity. Intriguingly, a greater amount of energy can be collected by the system once the retraction velocity is set above the protraction velocity. Our numerical calculations based on force field modelling indicate that a slow adiabatic sliding allows to utilize the available thermal energy to reduce the adhesion in agreement with our experimental observations. As a result, we demonstrate a mesoscale Brownian motor that can harvest thermal energy by adjusting the forward and backward sliding velocities and can pave the way for macroscale directed motion and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation of localized electrons in monolayer MoSe$_2$: importance of random effective magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hanle and spin polarization recovery effects on resident electrons in a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on EuS. We demonstrate that localized electrons provide the main contribution to the spin dynamics signal at low temperatures below 15~K for small magnetic fields of only a few mT. The spin relaxation of these electrons is determined by random effective magnetic fields due to a contact spin interaction, namely the hyperfine interaction with the nuclei in MoSe$_2$ or the exchange interaction with the magnetic ions of the EuS film. From the magnetic field angular dependence of the spin polarization we evaluate the anisotropy of the intervalley electron $g$-factor and the spin relaxation time. The non-zero in-plane $g$-factor $|g_x|\approx 0.1$, the value of which is comparable to its dispersion, is attributed to randomly localized electrons in the MoSe$_2$ layer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nonlinear Acoustic Hall Effect and Inverse Acoustic Faraday Effect in Dirac Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to realize the quantum nonlinear Hall effect and the inverse Faraday effect through the acoustic wave in a time-reversal invariant but inversion broken Dirac insulator. We focus on the acoustic frequency much lower than the Dirac gap such that the interband transition is suppressed and these effects arise solely from the intrinsic valley-contrasting band topology. The corresponding acoustoelectric conductivity and magnetoacoustic susceptibility are both proportional to the quantized valley Chern number and independent of the quasiparticle lifetime. The linear and nonlinear components of the longitudinal and transverse topological currents can be tuned by adjusting the polarization and propagation directions of the surface acoustic wave. The static magnetization generated by a circularly polarized acoustic wave scales linearly with the acoustic frequency as well as the strain-induced charge density. Our results unveil a quantized nonlinear topological acoustoelectric response of gapped Dirac materials, like hBN and transition-metal dichalcogenide, paving the way toward room-temperature acoustoelectric devices due to their large band gaps.</description>

      <title>Theory of Refraction, Ray-Wave Tilt, Hidden Momentum, and Apparent Topological Phases in Isotropy-Broken Materials based on Electromagnetism of Moving Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the problems of physics arguably greater in stature than even mathematical Hilberts problems is the mysterious nature of electromagnetic momentum in materials. In this paper we show that the difference between the Minkowski and Abraham momenta, which is composed of the Roentgen and Shockley hidden momenta, is directly related to the phenomenon of refraction and the tilt of rays from the wavefront propagation direction. We demonstrate that individual electromagnetic waves with non-unit indices of refraction n appear as quasistatic high-k waves to an observer in the proper frames of the waves. When Lorentz transformed into the material rest frames these high-k waves are Fresnel-Fizeau dragged from rest to their phase velocities and acquire longitudinal hidden momentum and related refractive properties. On the material level all electromagnetic waves belong to Fresnel wave surfaces topologically classified according to hyperbolic phases by Durach and determined from the electromagnetic material parameters. To moving observers, material parameters appear modified, which leads not only to the alterations of Fresnel wave surfaces, but even the topological classes of the materials may appear differently in moving frames. We discuss the phenomenon of the electromagnetic momentum tilt, defined as non-zero angle between Abraham and Minkowski momenta or equivalently between the rays and the wavefront propagation direction. We show that momentum tilt is only possible in isotropy-broken media, where E and H fields can be longitudinally polarized in presence of electric and magnetic bound charge waves. The momentum tilt can be understood as differential aberration of rays and waves when observed in material rest frame.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Optothermoelectric Trapping: Deeper Potentials at a Largescale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons (SP) and their mediated effects have been widely used to manipulate micro- and nanoscale objects of dielectric and metallic nature. In this work, we show how SP excitation can be used to induce thermofluidic and thermoelectric effects to manipulate colloidal dynamics on a large scale. In an evanescent plasmonic trap, temperature gradients induce fluid flow that can facilitate particle accumulation. However, large out-of-plane flows expel particles from the trap, resulting in a shallow trap potential. Here, we numerically demonstrate how adding thermoelectric fields can overpower the optical and hydrodynamic forces to achieve a stable nanoparticle assembly at low excitation powers. We calculate the corresponding optical, fluidic, and thermoelectric trapping forces and potentials. These potentials can be enabled without resonant SP excitation, which requires careful optical alignment. Thus, we explain the mechanism of how, despite weak optical intensities and forces, sufficient trapping force can be supplied via the evanescent optothermoelectric trap to obtain large-scale reversible nanoparticle assemblies, irrespective of their shape, size, or material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of magnonic thermal Hall transport driven by many-body skew scattering. In field-polarized chiral magnets, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces three-magnon interactions that violate time-reversal symmetry and interfere with the four-magnon scattering, thereby breaking microscopic detailed balance and causing thermal Hall currents. This mechanism operates without disorder or Berry curvature and is intrinsic to interacting spin systems. We argue that it can be as significant as the band-geometric anomalous velocity, highlighting the importance of magnon correlations in thermal Hall physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notwithstanding its relevance to many applications in sensing, security, and communications, electrical generation of narrow-band mid-infrared light remains highly challenging. Unlike in the ultraviolet or visible spectral regions few materials possess direct electronic transitions in the mid-infrared and most that do are created through complex band-engineering schemes. An alternative mechanism, independent of dipole active material transitions, relies instead on energy lost to the polar lattice through the Coulomb interaction. Longitudinal phonons radiated in this way can be spectrally tuned through the engineering of polar nanostructures and coupled to localized optical modes in the material, allowing them to radiate mid-infrared photons into the far-field. A recent theoretical work explored this process providing for the first time an indication of its technological relevance when compared to standard thermal emitters. In order to do so it nevertheless used an equilibrium model of the electron gas, making this model difficult to inform the design of an optimal device to experimentally observe the effect. The present paper removes this limitation, describing the electron gas using a rigorous, self-consistent, non-equilibrium Green's function model, accounting for variations in material properties across the device, and electron-electron interactions. Although the instability of the Schrodinger-Poisson iteration limits our studies to the low-bias regime, our results demonstrate emission rates comparable to that of room-temperature thermal emission despite such low biases. These results provide a pathway to design a confirmatory experiment of this new emission channel, that could power a new generation of mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dissipationless spin transport induced by a charge supercurrent in a monolayer van der Waals superconductor under the applied magnetic field and in a bilayer superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructure with no external field. It is shown that in both cases a combined action of the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field results in appearance of a nonunitary superconducting triplet correlations with nonzero average Cooper pair spin, which carry spin current in the presence of a condensate motion. Properties of this dissipationless spin current are investigated. In particular, it is shown that it manifests a rectification effect. In addition, in S/F heterostructures the amplitude and the sign of the spin current are controlled by gating.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electromagnetic response for Hall effect in time-reversal breaking materials</title>

Abstract: It is known that materials with broken time-reversal symmetry can have Hall response. Here we show that in addition to the conventional currents, a new type of nonlinear Hall current can occur in the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum origin arising from a novel dipole associated with the Berry curvature and band velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3 quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking materials by proposing a new kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.</description>

      <title>Schwinger mechanism of magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities and the bosonic Klein effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory of low-energy exitations-magnons that describes antiferromagnets is mapped into scalar electrodynamics of a charged scalar field interacting with an external electromagnetic potential. In the presence of a constant inhomogeneous external magnetic field the latter problem is technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation from the vacuum by an electric potential step (x step). Magnetic moment plays here the role of the electric charge, and magnons and antimagnons differ from each other in the sign of the magnetic moment. In the framework of such a consideration, it is important to take into account the vacuum instability (the Schwinger effect) under the magnon-antimagnon production on magnetic field inhomogeneities (an analog of pair creation from the vacuum by electric-like fields). We demonstrate how to use the strong field QED with x steps developed by the authors (SPG and DMG) to study the magnon-antimagnon pair production on magnetic field inhomogeneities. Characteristics of the vacuum instability obtained for some magnetic steps that allows exact solving the Klein-Gordon equation are presented. In particular, we consider examples of magnetic steps with very sharp field derivatives that correspond to a regularization of the Klein step. In the case of smooth-gradient steps, we describe an universal behavior of the flux density of created magnon pairs. We also note that since the low-energy magnons are bosons with small effective mass, then for the first time maybe the opportunity will arise to observe the Schwinger effect in the case of the Bose statistics, in particular, the bosonic Klein effect in laboratory conditions. Moreover, it turns out that in the case of the Bose statistics appears a new mechanism for amplifying the effect of the pair creation, which we call statistically assisted Schwinger effect.</description>

Abstract: The Probe-Particle Model combine theories designed for the simulation of scanning probe microscopy experiments, employing non-reactive, flexible tip apices to achieve sub-molecular resolution. In the article we present the latest version of the Probe-Particle Model implemented in the open-source ppafm package, highlighting substantial advancements in accuracy, computational performance, and userfriendliness. To demonstrate this we provide a comprehensive review of approaches for simulating non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy. They vary in complexity from simple Lennard-Jones potential to the latest full density-based model. We compared those approaches with ab initio calculated references, showcasing their respective merits. All parts of the ppafm package have undergone acceleration by 1-2 orders of magnitude using OpenMP and OpenCL technologies. The updated package includes n interactive graphical user interface and seamless integration into the Python ecosystem via pip, facilitating advanced scripting and interoperability with other software. This adaptability positions ppafm as an ideal tool for high-throughput applications, including the training of machine learning models for the automatic recovery of atomic structures from nc-AFM measurements. We envision significant potential for this application in future single-molecule analysis, synthesis, and advancements in on-surface science in general. Additionally, we discuss simulations of other sub-molecular scanning-probe imaging techniques, such as bond-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy and kelvin probe force microscopy, all built on the robust foundation of the Probe-Particle Model. Altogether this demonstrates the broad impact of the model across diverse domains of surface science and molecular chemistry.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic properties of a circular graphene nanoribbon (carbon belt) in a magnetic field parallel to its central axis is studied using a tight-binding model. Orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using an analytical expression of the energy eigenvalues as a function of the magnetic flux density for any size, and its temperature dependence is considered. In the absence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the orbital magnetic susceptibility diverges at absolute zero if the chemical potential is zero and the number of atoms is a multiple of four. As the temperature increases, the magnitude of susceptibility decreases according to the power law, whose exponent depends on the size. In the presence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the divergence of the susceptibility near absolute zero disappears, and the sign changes with the transfer integral parallel to the magnetic field and the temperature.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>

Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor with a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides provide a unique platform to engineer optoelectronic devices tuning their optical properties via stacking, twisting, or straining. Using ab initio Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we predict the electronic and optical (absorption and photoluminescence spectra) properties of MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayers with different stacking and twisting. We analyse the valley splitting and optical transitions, and explain the enhancement or quenching of the inter- and intra-layer exciton states. Contrary to established models, that focus on transitions near the high-symmetry point K, our results include all possible transitions across the Brillouin Zone. This result, for a twisted Se-based heterostructures, in an interlayer exciton with significant electron density in both layers and a mixed intralayer exciton distributed over both MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$. We propose that it should be possible to produce an inverted order of the excitonic states in some MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, where the energy of the intralayer WSe$_2$ exciton is lower than that in MoSe$_2$. We predict the variability of the exciton peak positions ($\sim$100 meV) and the exciton radiative lifetimes, from pico- to nano-seconds, and even micro-seconds in twisted bilayers. The control of exciton energies and lifetimes paves the way towards applications in quantum information technologies and optical sensing.</description>

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced magnetization in altermagnets and antiferromagnets</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets is a class of antiferromagnetic materials which has electron bands with lifted spin degeneracy in momentum space but vanishing net magnetization and no stray magnetic fields. Because of these properties, altermagnets have attracted much attention for potential use in spintronics. We here show that despite the absence of bulk magnetization, the itinerant electrons in altermagnets can generate a magnetization close to edges and vacuum interfaces. We find that surface-induced magnetization can also occur for conventional antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands, where the magnetization from the itinerant electrons originates from a subtle yet nonvanishing redistribution of the probability density on the unit cell level. An intuitive explanation of this effect in a phenomenological model is provided. In the altermagnetic case, the induced magnetization has a different spatial dependence than in the antiferromagnetic case due to the anisotropy of the spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, causing the edge-induced Friedel oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down electron densities to have different periods. We employ both a low-energy effective continuum model and lattice tight-binding calculations. Our results have implications for the usage of altermagnets and antiferromagnets in nanoscale spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) relates to the interaction between an electron's motion and its spin, and is ubiquitous in solid-state systems. Although the effect of SOC in normal-state phenomena has been extensively studied, its role in superconducting hybrid structures and devices opens many unexplored questions. In conjunction with broken symmetries and material inhomogeneities within superconducting hybrid structures, SOC may have additional contributions, beyond its effects in homogenous materials. Remarkably, even with well-established magnetic or nonmagnetic materials and conventional s-wave spin-singlet superconductors, SOC leads to emergent phenomena including equal-spin triplet pairing and topological superconductivity (hosting Majorana states), a modified current-phase relationship in Josephson junctions, and nonreciprocal transport. SOC is also responsible for transforming quasiparticles in superconducting structures which enhances the spin Hall effect and changes spin dynamics. Taken together, SOC in superconducting hybrid structures and the potential for electric tuning of the SOC strength, creates fascinating possibilities to advance superconducting spintronic devices for energy-efficient computing, and enable topological fault-tolerant quantum computing. By providing a description of experimental techniques and theoretical methods to study SOC, this Colloquium describes the current understanding of resulting phenomena in superconducting structures and offers a framework to select and design a growing class of materials systems where SOC plays an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X-ray ptychography is employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80 nm thin freestanding film of the room-temperature multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64 nm is resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X-ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic-like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L$_3$ edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in-plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71{\deg} between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain-free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non-collinear magnetic materials with soft X-rays.</description>

Abstract: Spin squeezing can increase the sensitivity of interferometric measurements of small signals in large spin ensembles beyond the standard quantum limit. In many practical settings, the ideal metrological gain is limited by imperfect readout of the sensor. To overcome this issue, protocols based on time reversal of unitary one-axis-twist (OAT) spin-squeezing dynamics have been proposed. Such protocols mitigate readout noise and, when implemented using cavity feedback, have been argued to also be robust against dissipation as long as the collective cooperativity of the system is sufficiently large [Davis et al., PRL 116, 053601 (2016)]. Here, we perform a careful systematic study of dissipative effects on three different implementations of a OAT twist-untwist sensing scheme (based on symmetric as well as asymmetric cavity feedback and on a Tavis-Cummings interaction). Our full treatment shows that the three approaches have markedly different properties and resilience when subject to dissipation. Moreover, the metrological gain for an implementation using symmetric cavity feedback is more sensitive to undesired dissipation than was previously appreciated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical simulation of highly-entangling quantum dynamics is conjectured to be generically hard. Thus, recently discovered measurement-induced transitions between highly entangling and low-entanglement dynamics are phase transitions in classical simulability. Here, we study simulability transitions beyond entanglement: noting that some highly-entangling dynamics (e.g., integrable systems or Clifford circuits) are easy to classically simulate, thus requiring "magic"--a subtle form of quantum resource--to achieve computational hardness, we ask how the dynamics of magic competes with measurements. We study the resulting "dynamical magic transitions" focusing on random monitored Clifford circuits doped by T gates (injecting magic). We identify dynamical "stabilizer-purification"--the collapse of a superposition of stabilizer states by measurements--as the mechanism driving this transition. We find cases where transitions in magic and entanglement coincide, but also others with a magic and simulability transition in a highly (volume-law) entangled phase. In establishing our results, we use Pauli-based computation, a scheme distilling the quantum essence of the dynamics to a magic state register subject to mutually commuting measurements. We link stabilizer-purification to "magic fragmentation" wherein these measurements separate into disjoint, O(1)-weight blocks, and relate this to the spread of magic in the original circuit becoming arrested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic modeling for a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. We particularly focus on the distribution of the fission probability. We find that it approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom $\nu$ of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding. We also show that $\nu$ corresponds to the number of eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian whose energy is close to the excitation energy of the system and at the same time which have significant components on both sides of a fission barrier.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a mechanical crystal with an optically programmable defect mode. By applying an optical spring to a single unit cell of a phononic crystal membrane, we smoothly transfer a single mechanical mode into the bandgap, thereby localizing its spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within a few unit cells. This localization is evidenced by an enhanced mechanical frequency shift commensurate with a 37-fold reduction in the mode's participating mass. Our results lay groundwork for a new class of optomechanical systems that control mechanical mode profile and participating mass.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09792</link>

Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization by Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics, emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations, has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, which are later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning techniques for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <title>Controlled Erasure as a Building Block for Universal Thermodynamically-Robust Superconducting Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing the energy inefficiency of conventional CMOS-based computing devices -- which rely on logically irreversible gates to process information -- remains both a fundamental engineering challenge and a practical social challenge of increasing importance. We extend an alternative computing paradigm that manipulates microstate distributions to store information in the metastable minima determined by an effective potential energy landscape. These minima serve as mesoscopic memories that are manipulated by a dynamic landscape to perform information processing. Central to our results is the control erase (CE) protocol that controls the landscape's metastable minima to determine whether information is preserved or erased. Importantly, successive protocol executions can implement a NAND gate -- a logically-irreversible universal logic gate. We show how to practically implement this in a device created by two inductively-coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). We identify circuit parameter ranges that give rise to effective CEs and establish the device's robustness against logical errors. These SQUID-based logical devices are capable of operating above GHz frequencies and at the $k_\text{B} T$ energy scale. Due to this, optimized devices and associated protocols provide a universal-computation substrate that is both computationally fast and energy efficient.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>
