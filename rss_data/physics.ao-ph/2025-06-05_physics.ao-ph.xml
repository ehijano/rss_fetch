      <title>Improving Post-Processing for Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting Using Deep Learning: Learning Precipitation Physics from High-Resolution Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) remains one of the main challenges in numerical weather prediction (NWP), primarily due to the difficulty of representing the full complexity of atmospheric microphysics through parameterization schemes. This study introduces a deep learning-based post-processing model, DL-QPF, which diagnoses precipitation fields from meteorological forecasts by learning directly from high-resolution radar estimates precipitation. The DL-QPF model is constructed using a Patch-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (Patch-cGAN) architecture combined with a U-Net generator and a discriminator. The generator learns meteorological features relevant to precipitation, while the adversarial loss from the discriminator encourages the generation of realistic rainfall patterns and distributions. Training is performed on three years of warm-season data over the Korean Peninsula, with input variables derived from ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System High-Resolution forecast (IFS-HRES). Model verification is conducted against multiple reference models, including global (IFS-HRES, KIM), regional (KIM-Regional, KIM-LENS), and AI-based (GraphCast) forecasts. Verification across multiple rainfall thresholds shows that DL-QPF achieves a frequency bias near one and superior success ratios. Particularly for heavy and intense rainfall events, DL-QPF outperforms both conventional NWP and an AI model, demonstrating improved skill in capturing high-intensity precipitation. This study highlights the potential of observational data-driven deep learning approaches in post-processing QPF. By directly learning from observations, DL-QPF reduces systematic biases and enhances the realism of forecasted rainfall distributions. These results demonstrate the model's potential to enhance QPF realism.</description>

      <title>FuXi-Ocean: A Global Ocean Forecasting System with Sub-Daily Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution ocean forecasting is crucial for maritime operations and environmental monitoring. While traditional numerical models are capable of producing sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they are computationally intensive and face challenges in maintaining accuracy at fine spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches offer improved computational efficiency and emerging potential, yet typically operate at daily resolution and struggle with sub-daily predictions due to error accumulation over time. We introduce FuXi-Ocean, the first data-driven global ocean forecasting model achieving six-hourly predictions at eddy-resolving 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution, reaching depths of up to 1500 meters. The model architecture integrates a context-aware feature extraction module with a predictive network employing stacked attention blocks. The core innovation is the Mixture-of-Time (MoT) module, which adaptively integrates predictions from multiple temporal contexts by learning variable-specific reliability , mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, FuXi-Ocean demonstrates superior skill in predicting key variables, including temperature, salinity, and currents, across multiple depths.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional energy flux acoustic propagation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends energy flux methods to handle three-dimensional ocean acoustic environments, the implemented solution captures horizontally refracted incoherent acoustic intensity, and its required computational effort is predominantly independent of range and frequency. Energy flux models are principally derived as incoherent solutions for acoustic propagation in bounded waveguides. The angular distribution of incoherent acoustic intensity may be derived from Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin modes transformed to the continuous angular domain via the ray-mode analogy. The adiabatic approximation maps angular distributions of acoustic intensity as waveguide properties vary along a range-dependent environment, and the final solution integrates a modal intensity kernel over propagation angles. Additional integration kernels can be derived that modulate the incoherent field by specific physical wave phenomena such as geometric spreading, refractive focusing, and boundary attenuation and interference. This three-dimensional energy flux model is derived from a double-mode-sum cross-product, is integrated over solid-angles, incorporates a bi-variate convergence factor, accounts for acoustic energy escaping the computational domain through transparent transverse boundaries, and accumulates bottom attenuation along transverse cycle trajectories. Transmission loss fields compare favorably with analytic, ray tracing, and parabolic equation solutions for the canonical ASA wedge problem, and three-dimensional adiabatic ray trajectories for the ideal wedge are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Statistical Equilibrium of Large-Scale Hydroelastic Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how statistical equilibrium can occur in out-of-equilibrium systems is of paramount interest, as it would enable the use of statistical mechanics tools to these systems. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of statistical equilibrium of the large scales of hydroelastic turbulent waves driven by small-scale random forcing. The wave field statistics at scales larger than the forcing scale, resolved in space and time, align well with the predictions of Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium spectra over more than a decade. We measure zero net energy flux in this regime, as expected. We also determine the effective temperature, entropy, and heat capacity of this nonequilibrium system, demonstrating that classical thermodynamic concepts apply to describe large scales in statistical equilibrium of turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic measures afford fair comparisons of AIWP and NWP model output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure for fair and meaningful comparisons of single-valued output from artificial intelligence based weather prediction (AIWP) and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, called potential continuous ranked probability score (PC). In a nutshell, we subject the deterministic backbone of physics-based and data-driven models post hoc to the same statistical postprocessing technique, namely, isotonic distributional regression (IDR). Then we find PC as the mean continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of the postprocessed probabilistic forecasts. The nonnegative PC measure quantifies potential predictive performance and is invariant under strictly increasing transformations of the model output. PC attains its most desirable value of zero if, and only if, the weather outcome Y is a fixed, non-decreasing function of the model output X. The PC measure is recorded in the unit of the outcome, has an upper bound of one half times the mean absolute difference between outcomes, and serves as a proxy for the mean CRPS of real-time, operational probabilistic products. When applied to WeatherBench 2 data, our approach demonstrates that the data-driven GraphCast model outperforms the leading, physics-based European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution (HRES) model. Furthermore, the PC measure for the HRES model aligns exceptionally well with the mean CRPS of the operational ECMWF ensemble. Across application domains, our approach affords comparisons of single-valued forecasts in settings where the pre-specification of a loss function -- which is the usual, and principally superior, procedure in forecast contests, administrative, and benchmarks settings -- places competitors on unequal footings.</description>

      <title>Gulf Stream drives Kuroshio behind the recent abnormal ocean warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent unprecedented ocean warming has produced coherent sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Despite extensive research on inter-basin interactions, the causal mechanisms linking North Pacific and North Atlantic variability remain poorly understood. Here we show that internal SST variability in the Gulf Stream region accounts for 16% of internal SST variability in the Kuroshio region in climate model simulations, while no significant reverse influence is detected. Specifically, positive SST anomalies in the Gulf Stream excite a Northern Annular Mode (NAM)-like atmospheric circulation pattern, that weakens the Aleutian Low over the North Pacific. The resulting northward shift of the Kuroshio Extension enhances northward warm water transport and induces positive SST anomalies in the North Pacific. Climate models with higher oceanic spatial resolution capture this SST-NAM coupling substantially better than coarser-resolution models. These findings identify North Atlantic variability as a key pacemaker of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude climate, with implications for understanding and predicting the accelerated ocean warming observed across the Northern Hemisphere in recent decades.</description>

      <title>OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.
