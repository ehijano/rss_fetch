      <title>LLM-Powered Nuanced Video Attribute Annotation for Enhanced Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a case study on deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) as an advanced "annotation" mechanism to achieve nuanced content understanding (e.g., discerning content "vibe") at scale within a large-scale industrial short-form video recommendation system. Traditional machine learning classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing: (1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Can We Hide Machines in the Crowd? Quantifying Equivalence in LLM-in-the-loop Annotation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in text annotation focus primarily on the correctness of the output, typically comparing model-generated labels to human-annotated ``ground truth'' using standard performance metrics. In contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how labeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated across individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we approach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of mimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a statistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\alpha$, paired bootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure. This evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human annotators without being distinguishable.
  We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact -- and find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator in the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting task-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample of human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in a given application.</description>

      <title>Reproducing and Extending Causal Insights Into Term Frequency Computation in Neural Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ranking models have shown outstanding performance across a variety of tasks, such as document retrieval, re-ranking, question answering and conversational retrieval. However, the inner decision process of these models remains largely unclear, especially as models increase in size. Most interpretability approaches, such as probing, focus on correlational insights rather than establishing causal relationships. The paper 'Axiomatic Causal Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval Models' by Chen et al. addresses this gap by introducing a framework for activation patching - a causal interpretability method - in the information retrieval domain, offering insights into how neural retrieval models compute document relevance. The study demonstrates that neural ranking models not only capture term-frequency information, but also that these representations can be localized to specific components of the model, such as individual attention heads or layers. This paper aims to reproduce the findings by Chen et al. and to further explore the presence of pre-defined retrieval axioms in neural IR models. We validate the main claims made by Chen et al., and extend the framework to include an additional term-frequency axiom, which states that the impact of increasing query term frequency on document ranking diminishes as the frequency becomes higher. We successfully identify a group of attention heads that encode this axiom and analyze their behavior to give insight into the inner decision-making process of neural ranking models.</description>

      <title>Crossing Domains without Labels: Distant Supervision for Term Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis. Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability. Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points. We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this area.</description>

      <title>M3Retrieve: Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval for Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare, multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark. M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over 1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation, and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.</description>

      <title>Ethical AI prompt recommendations in large language models using collaborative filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) shape AI development, ensuring ethical prompt recommendations is crucial. LLMs offer innovation but risk bias, fairness issues, and accountability concerns. Traditional oversight methods struggle with scalability, necessitating dynamic solutions. This paper proposes using collaborative filtering, a technique from recommendation systems, to enhance ethical prompt selection. By leveraging user interactions, it promotes ethical guidelines while reducing bias. Contributions include a synthetic dataset for prompt recommendations and the application of collaborative filtering. The work also tackles challenges in ethical AI, such as bias mitigation, transparency, and preventing unethical prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Reliable Rankers? Rank Manipulation via Two-Stage Token Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small, natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.</description>

      <title>Overview of the Plagiarism Detection Task at PAN 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generative plagiarism detection task at PAN 2025 aims at identifying automatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific articles and aligning them with their respective sources. We created a novel large-scale dataset of automatically generated plagiarism using three large language models: Llama, DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral. In this task overview paper, we outline the creation of this dataset, summarize and compare the results of all participants and four baselines, and evaluate the results on the last plagiarism detection task from PAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We found that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches as naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide promising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of these approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a lack in generalizability.</description>

      <title>Exposing Citation Vulnerabilities in Generative Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and \(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that well-known techniques are limited by language differences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility, agility and iterative approach to business processes.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.</description>

      <title>Injecting External Knowledge into the Reasoning Process Enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found \href{here}{https://github.com/Trustworthy-Information-Access/Passage-Injection}.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.</description>

      <title>Reasoning-enhanced Query Understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate inference of user intent is crucial for enhancing document retrieval in modern search engines. While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been assessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves, long-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they remain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To bridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the reasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i) it breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture user intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic interpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it independently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion strategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a large-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine and distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into smaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR demonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse and dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReDI-6FC7/.</description>

      <title>TalkPlay-Tools: Conversational Music Recommendation with LLM Tool Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval (IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s). While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm, especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and (2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that BlockRank Mistral matches or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100 MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length) within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.</description>

      <title>Do RAG Systems Really Suffer From Positional Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.</description>

      <title>SimpleDeepSearcher: Deep Information Seeking via Web-Powered Reasoning Trajectory Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

      <title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation</description>
