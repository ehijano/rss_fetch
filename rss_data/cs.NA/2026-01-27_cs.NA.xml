      <title>A Boundary Integral Formulation of an Acoustic Boundary Layer Model in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a boundary integral formulation of the Helmholtz equation with visco-thermal boundary conditions, in two dimensions. Such boundary conditions allow for the accurate simulation of viscous and thermal losses in the vicinity of the boundary, which are particularly relevant in acoustic devices with narrow features. Using cancellations between hyper-singular operators, a variant of the method of images technique, and analytic pre-conditioners, we derive integral equations that are Fredholm second-kind, up to the application of a boundedly invertible operator. This approach allows for the fast and accurate solution of acoustics problems with boundary layers.</description>

      <title>A New Look at the Ensemble Kalman Filter for Inverse Problems: Duality, Non-Asymptotic Analysis and Convergence Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents new results and understanding of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse problems. In particular, using a Lagrangian dual perspective we show that EnKF can be derived from the sample average approximation (SAA) of the Lagrangian dual function. The beauty of this new duality perspective is that it facilitates us to prove and numerically verify a novel non-asymptotic convergence result for the EnKF. Motivated by the new perspective, we also present a new convergence improvement strategy for the Ensemble Kalman Inversion Algorithm (EnKI), which is an iterative version of the EnKF for inverse problems. In particular, we propose an adaptive multiplicative correction to the sample covariance matrix at each iteration and we call this new algorithm as EnKI-MC (I). Based on the new duality perspective, we derive an expression for the optimal correction factor at each iteration of the EnKI algorithm to accelerate the convergence. In addition, we also consider an ensemble specific multiplicative covariance correction strategy (EnKI-MC (II)) where a different correction is employed for each ensemble. By viewing EnKI through the lens of fixed-point iteration, we also provide theoretical results that guarantees the convergence of EnKI-MC (I) algorithm. Numerical investigations for the deconvolution problem, initial condition inversion in advection-convection problem, initial condition inversion in a Lorenz 96 model, and inverse problem constrained by elliptic partial differential equation are conducted to verify the non-asymptotic results for EnKF and to assess the performance of convergence improvement strategies for EnKI. The numerical results suggest that the proposed strategies for EnKI not only led to faster convergence in comparison to the currently employed techniques but also better quality solutions at termination of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>The direct-line method for forward and inverse linear elasticity problems of composite materials in general domains with multiple singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a combined strategy of domain decomposition and the direct-line method is implemented to solve the forward and inverse linear elasticity problems of composite materials in general domains with multiple singularities. Domain decomposition technology treats the general domain as the union of some star-shaped subdomains, which can be handled using the direct-line method. The direct-line method demonstrates rapid convergence of the semi-discrete eigenvalues towards the exact eigenvalues of the elliptic operator, thereby naturally capturing the singularities. We also establish optimal error estimates for the proposed method. Especially, our method can handle multiple singular point problems in general regions, which are difficult to deal with by most methods. On the other hand, the inverse elasticity problem is constructed as a energy functional minimization problem with total variational regularization, we use the aforementioned method as a forward solver to reconstruct the lam\'{e} coefficient of multiple singular points in general regions. Our method can simultaneously deduce heterogeneous $\mu$ and $\lambda$ between different materials. Through numerical experiments on three forward and inverse problems, we systematically verified the accuracy and reliability of this method to solve forward and inverse elastic problems in general domains with multiple singularities.</description>

      <title>Operator splitting based diffusion samplers and improved convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a class of samplers for the diffusion model using the operator-splitting technique. The linear drift term and the nonlinear score-driven drift of the probability flow ordinary differential equation are split and applied by flow maps alternatively. Moreover, we conduct detailed analyses for the second-order sampler, establishing a non-asymptotic total variation distance error bound of order $O(d/T^2+\sqrt{d}\varepsilon_{\mathrm{score}}+d\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Jac}})$, where $d$ is the data dimension; $T$ is the number of sampling steps; $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{score}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Jac}}$ measure the discrepancy between the actual score function and learned score function. Our bound is sharper than existing works, yielding bounds of $O(d^p/T^2)$ with some $p&gt;1$ for specific second-order samplers. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional synthetic dataset corroborate the established quadratic dependence on the step size $1/T$ in the error bound.</description>

      <title>An algorithmic approach to direct spline products: procedures and computational aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient algorithmic procedure for implementing the direct formula that represents the product of splines in the B-spline basis. We first demonstrate the relevance of this direct approach through numerical evidences showing that implicit methods, such as collocation, may fail in some instances due to severe ill-conditioning of the associated system matrices, whereas the direct formula remains robust. We then recast the direct formula into an algorithmic framework based on the Oslo Algorithm and subsequently enhance it, through a factorization of the terms to be computed, to dramatically improve computational efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the substantial reduction in computational cost achieved by the proposed method. Implementation aspects are also discussed to ensure numerical stability and applicability.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Dissipative Weak Solutions for the Euler Equations of Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dissipative weak (DW) solutions of the Euler equations of gas dynamics using the first-, second-, third-, fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-order local characteristic decomposition-based central-upwind (LCDCU), low-dissipation central-upwind (LDCU), and viscous finite volume (VFV) methods, whose higher-order extensions are obtained via the framework of the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) schemes. These methods are applied to several benchmark problems, including several two-dimensional Riemann problems and a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability test. The numerical results demonstrate that for methods converging only weakly in space and time, the limiting solutions are generalized DW solutions, approximated in the sense of ${\cal K}$-convergence and dependent on the numerical scheme. For all of the studied methods, we compute the associated Young measures and compare the DW solutions using entropy production and energy defect criteria.</description>

      <title>Sparse RBF Networks for PDEs and nonlocal equations: function space theory, operator calculus, and training algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic analysis and extension of the sparse radial basis function network (SparseRBFnet) previously introduced for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Based on its adaptive-width shallow kernel network formulation, we further investigate its function-space characterization, operator evaluation, and computational algorithm. We provide a unified description of the solution space for a broad class of radial basis functions (RBFs). Under mild assumptions, this space admits a characterization as a Besov space, independent of the specific kernel choice. We further demonstrate how the explicit kernel-based structure enables quasi-analytical evaluation of both differential and nonlocal operators, including fractional Laplacians. On the computational end, we study the adaptive-width network and related three-phase training strategy through a comparison with variants concerning the modeling and algorithmic details. In particular, we assess the roles of second-order optimization, inner-weight training, network adaptivity, and anisotropic kernel parameterizations. Numerical experiments on high-order, fractional, and anisotropic PDE benchmarks illustrate the empirical insensitivity to kernel choice, as well as the resulting trade-offs between accuracy, sparsity, and computational cost. Collectively, these results consolidate and generalize the theoretical and computational framework of SparseRBFnet, supporting accurate sparse representations with efficient operator evaluation and offering theory-grounded guidance for algorithmic and modeling choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, some window functions have been introduced into the nonuniform fast Fourier transform and the regularized Shannon sampling. Inspired by these works, we utilize a sinh-type function to accelerate the convergence of the Lagrangian nonuniform sampling series. Our theoretical error estimates and numerical experiments demonstrate that the sinh regularized nonuniform sampling series achieves a superior convergence rate compared to the fastest existing Gaussian regularized nonuniform sampling series.</description>

      <title>High-Order Mesh r-Adaptivity with Tangential Relaxation and Guaranteed Mesh Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order meshes are crucial for achieving optimal convergence rates in curvilinear domains, preserving symmetry, and aligning with key flow features in moving mesh simulations, but their quality is challenging to control. In prior work, we have developed techniques based on Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) to adapt a given high-order mesh to the geometry and solution of the partial differential equation (PDE). Here, we extend this framework to address two key gaps in the literature for high-order mesh r-adaptivity. First, we introduce tangential relaxation on curved surfaces using solely the discrete mesh representation, eliminating the need for access to underlying geometry (e.g., CAD model). Second, we ensure a continuously positive Jacobian determinant throughout the domain. This determinant positivity is essential for using the high-order mesh resulting from r-adaptivity with arbitrary quadrature schemes in simulations. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be robust using a variety of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Novel Product Manifold Modeling and Orthogonality-Constrained Neural Network Solver for Parameterized Generalized Inverse Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parameterized orthogonality-constrained neural network is proposed for the first time to solve the parameterized generalized inverse eigenvalue problem (PGIEP) on product manifolds, offering a new perspective to address PGIEP. The key contributions are twofold. First, we construct a novel model for the PGIEP, where the optimization variables are located on the product of a Stiefel manifold and a Euclidean manifold. This model enables the application of optimization algorithms on the Stiefel manifold, a capability that is not achievable with existing models. Additionally, the gradient Lipschitz continuity of the objective function is proved. Second, a parameterized Stiefel multilayer perceptron (P-SMLP) that incorporates orthogonality constraints is proposed. Through hard constraints, P-SMLP enables end-to-end training without the need of alternating training between the two manifolds, providing a robust computational framework for generic PGIEPs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stability and Convergence of Mixed Finite Elements for Linear Regularized 13-Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stable and convergent mixed finite element method (MFEM) for the linear regularized 13-moment (R13) equations in rarefied gas dynamics. Unlike existing methods that require stabilization via penalty terms, our scheme achieves inherent stability by enriching the finite element basis with bubble functions. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing second-order convergence rates in the $L^2$ norm under mild regularity assumptions. Beyond theoretical properties, our scheme demonstrates practical advantages over standard MFEM schemes, yielding robust numerical results even in the presence of geometric singularities.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Moment Matrix Blocks Spectra using Mutual Shadow Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an "aperture" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder "diffraction" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of "endfire" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.</description>

      <title>A theoretical and computational framework for three dimensional inverse medium scattering using the linearized low-rank structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a theoretical and computational framework for solving the three dimensional inverse medium scattering problem, based on a set of data-driven basis arising from the linearized problem. This set of data-driven basis consists of generalizations of prolate spheroidal wave functions to three dimensions (3D PSWFs), the main ingredients to explore a low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. We first establish the fundamentals of the inverse scattering analysis, including regularity in a customized Sobolev space and new a priori estimate. This is followed by a computational framework showcasing computing the 3D PSWFs and the low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. These results rely heavily on the fact that the 3D PSWFs are eigenfunctions of both a restricted Fourier integral operator and a Sturm-Liouville differential operator. Furthermore we propose a Tikhonov regularization method with a customized penalty norm and a localized imaging technique to image a targeting object despite the possible presence of its surroundings. Finally various numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Weak Galerkin Method for Linear Elasticity with Nonpolynomial Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized weak Galerkin (gWG) finite element method for linear elasticity problems on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes. The proposed framework is flexible and efficient, allowing for the use of nonpolynomial approximating functions. The generalized weak differential operators are defined as an element-level correction of the classical differential operators accounting for boundary discontinuities. This construction reduces computational cost and provides greater flexibility than standard weak Galerkin formulations. The gWG framework naturally accommodates arbitrary finite-dimensional approximation spaces, including nonpolynomial activation-based spaces with randomly selected parameters. Error equations and error estimates are established for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method is locking-free, robust with respect to mesh geometry, and effective on general polygonal and polyhedral partitions. In particular, activation-based interior approximation spaces exhibit convergence behavior comparable to that of classical polynomial spaces.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Based RBF Collocation Method for Surface Advection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Trajectory-Based RBF Collocation (TBRBF) method for solving surface advection-diffusion equations on smooth, compact manifolds. TBRBF decouples advection and diffusion by applying a characteristic treatment with a Kansa-type RBF collocation method for diffusion PDE, which yields an operator-split characteristic (OSC) system comprising a characteristic ODE and a diffusion PDE. We rigorously prove the equivalence between the OSC system and the original surface PDE on manifolds by embedding the latter into a narrow band domain. Using an intrinsic approach, we construct a time-continuous embedded PDE with push-forward operators in each chart of the atlas and establish its equivalence with the OSC system in the narrow band. Restricting the solution back to the manifold recovers the OSC system on manifolds, ensuring that the method introduces no operator splitting error. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the robust stability and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Generalized Conditional Gradient Method for Mean Field Games with Local Coupling Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) method for time-dependent second-order mean field games (MFG) with local coupling terms. While explicit convergence rates of the GCG method were previously established only for globally coupled interactions, the assumptions used there fail to cover typical local interactions such as congestion effects. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a refined analytical framework adapted to local couplings and derive explicit convergence estimates in terms of the exploitability and optimality gap. The key difficulty lies in establishing uniform bounds on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman solutions; this is solved via the Cole--Hopf transformation under a standard quadratic Hamiltonian with a convection effect. We further provide numerical experiments demonstrating convergence behavior and confirming the theoretical rates. Additionally, the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions to the MFG system with locally coupled interactions are established.</description>

      <title>Symplecticity-Preserving Prediction of Hamiltonian Dynamics by Generalized Kernel Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based surrogate for integrating Hamiltonian dynamics that is symplectic by construction and tailored to large prediction horizons is proposed. The method learns a scalar potential whose gradient enters a symplectic-Euler update, yielding a discrete flow map that exactly preserves the canonical symplectic structure. Training is formulated as a gradient Hermite--Birkhoff interpolation problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, providing a systematic framework for existence, uniqueness, and error control. Algorithmically, the symplectic kernel predictor is combined with structure-preserving model order reduction, enabling efficient treatment of high-dimensional discretized PDEs. Numerical tests for a pendulum, a nonlinear spring--mass chain, and a semi-discrete wave equation show nearly algebraic greedy convergence and long-time trajectory errors reduce by two to three orders of magnitude compared to an implicit midpoint baseline at the same macro time step.</description>

      <title>A Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method for high-order cell-centred finite volume solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the application of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods to higher-order cell-centred finite-volume formulations for solid mechanics. While conventional schemes are typically limited to second-order accuracy, we present third- and fourth-order formulations employing local least-squares reconstructions for gradient evaluation and Gaussian quadrature at cell faces. These schemes enable accurate resolution of complex stress and deformation fields in linear and nonlinear solids while retaining the flexibility of finite-volume methods. A key contribution is a JFNK solution strategy for these higher-order schemes, eliminating the need to assemble complex Jacobian matrices. A compact-stencil approximate Jacobian is used as a preconditioner, providing efficiency gains similar to second-order frameworks. To enhance robustness on irregular meshes, an alpha-stabilisation scheme is incorporated, damping high-frequency error modes without compromising formal accuracy. The proposed methodology is benchmarked across a suite of two- and three-dimensional test problems involving elastic and nonlinear materials, where key performance metrics, including accuracy, computational cost, memory usage, and robustness, are systematically evaluated. Results confirm that the higher-order formulations deliver substantial accuracy improvements over second-order schemes, while the JFNK approach achieves strong performance with only minimal modifications to existing segregated frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of combining higher-order finite-volume methods with JFNK solvers to advance the state of the art in computational solid mechanics. The implementations are openly released in the solids4foam toolbox for OpenFOAM, supporting further exploration and adoption by the community.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Error of Generative Diffusion Models: From Euler-Maruyama to Higher-Order Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although generative diffusion models (GDMs) are widely used in practice, their theoretical foundations remain limited, especially concerning the impact of different discretization schemes applied to the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE). Existing convergence analysis largely focuses on Euler-Maruyama (EM)-like methods and does not extend to higher-order schemes, which are naturally expected to provide improved discretization accuracy. In this paper, we establish asymptotic 2-Wasserstein convergence results for SDE-based discretization methods employed in sampling for GDMs. We provide an all-at-once error bound analysis of the EM method that accounts for all error sources and establish convergence under all prevalent score-matching error assumptions in the literature, assuming a strongly log-concave data distribution. Moreover, we present the first error bound result for arbitrary higher-order SDE-discretization methods with known strong L_2 convergence in dependence on the discretization grid and the score-matching error. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with an extensive numerical study, providing comprehensive experimental evidence and showing that, contrary to popular believe, higher order discretization methods can in fact retain their theoretical advantage over EM for sampling GDMs.</description>

      <title>A stabilized finite element method for a flow problem arising from 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose, {analyze}, and validate a stabilized finite element method for a flow problem arising from the assessment of {4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging quality}. Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation and splitting its velocity as the MRI-observed one (considered a datum) plus an ``observation error'', a modified Navier-Stokes problem is derived. This procedure allows us to estimate the quality of the measured velocity fields, while also providing an alternative approach to pressure reconstruction, thereby avoiding invasive procedures. Since equal-order approximations have become a popular choice for problems linked to pressure recovery from MRI images, we design a stabilized finite element method allowing equal-order interpolations for velocity and pressure. In the linearized version of the resulting model, we prove stability and (optimal order) error estimates and test the method with a variety of numerical experiments testing both the linearized case and the more realistic nonlinear one.</description>

      <title>Justification of a Relaxation Approximation for the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system governs the diffuse-interface dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. We consider a relaxation approximation of the NSCH system that is composed by a system of first-order hyperbolic balance laws and second-order elliptic operators. We prove first that the solutions of an initial boundary value problem for the approximation recover the limiting NSCH system for vanishing relaxation parameters. To cope with the singular limit we exploit the fact that the approximate solutions dissipate an almost quadratic energy, and employ the relative entropy-framework. In the second part of the work we provide numerical evidence for the analytical results, even in flow regimes not covered by the assumptions needed for the theoretical results. Using a novel marker-and-cell conservative finite-difference approach for both the approximation and the limit system, we are able to compute physically relevant interfacial flow problems including Ostwald ripening and high-velocity flow.</description>

      <title>Pointwise-in-time convergence analysis of an Alikhanov scheme for a 2D nonlinear subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discretize the Caputo time derivative of order \alpha \in (0,1) using the Alikhanov scheme on a quasi-graded temporal mesh, and employ the Newton linearization method to approximate the nonlinear term. This yields a linearized fully discrete scheme for the two-dimensional nonlinear time fractional subdiffusion equation with weakly singular solutions. For the purpose of conducting a pointwise convergence analysis using the comparison principle, we develop a new stability result. The global L^2-norm convergence order is min{\alpha r, 2}, and the local L^2-norm convergence order is min{r, 2} under appropriate conditions and assumptions. Ultimately, the rates of convergence demonstrated by the numerical experiments serve to validate the analytical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Moving sample method for solving time-dependent partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit sharp gradients or local singularities is computationally demanding, as traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often suffer from inefficient point allocation that wastes resources on regions already well-resolved. This paper presents an adaptive sampling framework for PINNs aimed at efficiently solving time-dependent partial differential equations with pronounced local singularities. The method employs a residual-driven strategy, where the spatial-temporal distribution of training points is iteratively updated according to the error field from the previous iteration. This targeted allocation enables the network to concentrate computational effort on regions with significant residuals, achieving higher accuracy with fewer sampling points compared to uniform sampling. Numerical experiments on representative PDE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach improves solution quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient SN-like and PN-like Dynamic Low Rank methods for Thermal Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods are a promising way to reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of the high-dimensional thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations. The TRT equations are a system of nonlinear PDEs that model the energy exhchange between the material temperature and the radiation energy density; due to their high dimensionality, solving the TRT equations is often bottleneck in multi-physics simulations. DLR methods represent the solution in terms of time-evolving SVD-like factors of angle and space. Although previous work has explored DLR methods for TRT, most of the methods have limitations that make them impractical for realistic scenarios and uncompetitive with current non-DLR production codes.
  Here we develop new PN-like and SN-like Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods for TRT. In the SN-like DLR method, we use the time-evolving angular basis functions to select time-evolving angles; this DLR formulation enables us to use the highly optimized SN transport sweep as our main computational kernel, and results in a practical way of leveraging low-rank methods in production TRT codes. In contrast, our PN-like DLR method uses an even-parity formulation and results in positive-definite linear systems to solve for each time step.
  We demonstrate the methods on several challenging, highly heterogenous problems in two spatial dimensions $(4$D) that these DLR schemes can give significant reduction in angular artifacts (``ray effects'') with the same cost as gold-standard SN methods.</description>

      <title>A mixed interpolation-regression method for numerical integration on the unit circle using zeros of para-orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new alternative numerical procedure to the Szeg\H{o} quadrature formulas for the estimation of integrals with respect to a positive Borel measure $\mu$ supported on the unit circle is presented. As in many practical situations, we assume that the values of the integrand $F$ are only known at a finite number of points, which we will assume to be uniformly distributed on the unit circle (although this does not actually constitute a restriction). Our technique consists of obtaining an approximating Laurent polynomial $L$ to $F$ by interpolation in the Hermite sense in a collection of these points that mimic the zeros of a para-orthogonal polynomial with respect to $\mu$, and to use the values of $F$ at the remaining nodes to improve the accuracy of the approximation by a process of simultaneous complex regression. Some numerical examples are carried out.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free and mass-conservative virtual element methods for the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design and analyze semi/fully-discrete virtual element approximations for the time-dependent Navier--Stokes-Cahn--Hilliard equations, modeling the dynamics of two-phase incompressible fluid flows with diffuse interfaces. A new variational formulation is derived involving solely the velocity, pressure, and phase field, together with corresponding a priori energy estimates. The spatial discretization is based on the coupling divergence-free and $C^1$-conforming elements of high-order, while the time discretization employs a classical backward Euler scheme. By introducing a novel skew-symmetric trilinear form to discretize the convective term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, we propose discrete schemes that satisfy mass conservation and energy bounds. Moreover, optimal error estimates are provided for both formulations. Finally, two numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical findings and to illustrate the good performance of the proposed schemes for different polynomial degrees and polygonal meshes.</description>

      <title>Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03210v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results.</description>

      <title>Fully Turbulent Wakes at Low Reynolds Numbers: the Case of the Thin Flat Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wake flow past a thin two-dimensional flat plate normal to the uniform stream and demonstrate that this flow is turbulent already at a relatively low Reynolds number of $Re = 400$. This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders. We also identify possible physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these differences.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Bayesian Inverse Problems with Generative Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven methods for the solution of inverse problems have become widely popular in recent years thanks to the rise of machine learning techniques. A popular approach concerns the training of a generative model on additional data to learn a bespoke prior for the problem at hand. In this article we present an analysis for such problems by presenting quantitative error bounds for minimum Wasserstein-2 generative models for the prior. We show that under some assumptions, the error in the posterior due to the generative prior will inherit the same rate as the prior with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance. We further present numerical experiments that verify that aspects of our error analysis manifests in some benchmarks followed by an elliptic PDE inverse problem where a generative prior is used to model a non-stationary field.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical approximation of nonlinear conservation laws with hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the Cauchy problem for the scalar conservation law \[ \partial_t u + \partial_t w + \partial_x f(u) = 0, \] where $w(x,t) = [\mathcal{F}(u)(x,t)]$ is the output of a specific hysteresis operator, namely the Play hysteresis operator, and $f$ is a $\mathbf{C}^2$ convex flux function. The hysteresis operator models a rate-independent memory effect, introducing a specific non-local feature into the partial differential equation. We define a suitable notion of entropy weak solution and analyse in detail the Riemann problem. Furthermore, a Godunov-type finite volume numerical scheme is developed to compute approximate solutions. The convergence of the scheme for $\mathrm{BV}$ initial data provides the existence of an entropy weak solution. Finally, a stability estimate is established, implying the uniqueness and overall well-posedness of the entropy weak solution.</description>

      <title>A note on continuous data assimilation for stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations in 2D and 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation (CDA) methods, such as the nudging algorithm introduced by Azouani, Olson, and Titi (AOT), have proven to be highly effective in deterministic settings for asymptotically synchronizing approximate solutions with observed dynamics. In this note, we introduce and analyze an algorithm for CDA for the two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations (CBFEs) driven by either additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise. The model is believed to provide an accurate description when the flow velocity exceeds the regime of validity of Darcy's law and the porosity remains moderately large. We derive sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial resolution of observations that ensure convergence of the assimilated solution to the true stochastic flow. We demonstrate convergence in the mean-square sense, and additionally establish pathwise convergence in the presence of additive noise. The CBFEs, also known as Navier-Stokes equations with damping, exhibit enhanced stability properties due to the presence of nonlinear damping term. In particular, we show that nonlinear damping not only enables the implementation of CDA in three dimensions but also yields improved convergence results in two dimensions when compared to the classical Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Criteria Inverse Robustness in Radiotherapy Planning Using Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy planning naturally leads to a multi-criteria optimization problem which is subject to different sources of uncertainty. In order to find the desired treatment plan, a decision maker must balance these objectives as well as the level of robustness towards uncertainty against each other. This paper showcases a quantitative approach to do so, which combines the theoretical model with the ability to deal with practical challenges. To this end, the uncertainty, which can be expressed via the so-called dose-influence matrix, is modelled using interval matrices. We use inverse robustness to introduce an additional objective, which aims to maximize the volume of the uncertainty set. A multi-criteria approach allows to handle the uncertainty while keeping appropriate values of the other objective functions. We solve the resulting quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem (QCQP) by first relaxing it to a convex semidefinite problem (SDP) and then reconstructing optimal solutions of the QCQP from solutions of the SDP.</description>

      <title>On the contraction rate of the posterior distribution for nonlinear PDE parameter identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the estimation of a parameter $f$ in PDEs using Bayesian procedures, and focus on posterior distributions constructed using Gaussian process priors, and its variational approximation. We establish contraction rates for the posterior distribution and the variational approximation in the regime of low-regularity parameters. The main novelty of the study lies in relaxing the condition that the ground truth parameter must lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian process prior, which is commonly imposed in existing studies on posterior contraction rate analysis [14,40,44]. The analysis relies on a delicate approximation argument that suitably balances various error sources. We illustrate the general theory on three nonlinear inverse problems for PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous and Self--Contained Proof of the Grover--Rudolph State Preparation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states whose amplitudes encode classical probability distributions is a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms based on amplitude encoding and amplitude estimation. Given a probability distribution $\{p_k\}_{k=0}^{2^n-1}$, the Grover--Rudolph procedure constructs an $n$-qubit state $\ket{\psi}=\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}\sqrt{p_k}\ket{k}$ by recursively applying families of controlled one-qubit rotations determined by a dyadic refinement of the target distribution. Despite its widespread use, the algorithm is often presented with informal correctness arguments and implicit conventions on the underlying dyadic tree. In this work we give a rigorous and self-contained analysis of the Grover--Rudolph construction: we formalize the dyadic probability tree, define the associated angle map via conditional masses, derive the resulting trigonometric factorizations, and prove by induction that the circuit prepares exactly the desired measurement law in the computational basis. As a complementary circuit-theoretic contribution, we show that each Grover--Rudolph stage is a uniformly controlled $\RY$ rotation on an active register and provide an explicit ancilla-free transpilation into the gate dictionary $\{\RY(\cdot),X,\CNOT(\cdot\to\cdot)\}$ using Gray-code ladders and a Walsh--Hadamard angle transform.</description>

      <title>Elementary Quantum Gates from Lie Group Embeddings in $U(2^n)$: Geometry, Universality, and Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard circuit model, elementary gates are specified relative to a chosen tensor factorization and are therefore extrinsic to the ambient group $U(2^n)$. Writing $N=2^n$, we introduce an intrinsic descriptor layer in $U(N)$ by declaring as primitive the motions inside faithful embedded copies of $SU(2)$, leading to the phase-free dictionary $\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)=\bigcup_{\phi\in\Emb(SU(2),U(N))}\phi(SU(2))$, and we also discuss the phase-inclusive $U(2)$ variant. We show that $\Emb(SU(2),U(N))$ decomposes into finitely many $U(N)$-homogeneous strata indexed by isotypic multiplicities, with stabilizers given by centralizers; the canonical two-level sector is organized by $\Gr_2(\C^N)$ up to a $PSU(2)$ gauge. Equipping $U(N)$ with the Hilbert--Schmidt bi-invariant metric, each embedded subgroup is totally geodesic. Using two-level QR/Givens factorization together with an explicit generation of diagonal tori by two-level phase rotations, we prove phase-free universality $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{2lvl}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$ and hence $\langle\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\mathrm{elem}}(n)\rangle=SU(N)$. Full universality in $U(N)$ follows by adjoining the abelian diagonal/global $U(1)$ factors (equivalently, by passing to the $U(2)$ two-level dictionary). Finally, we record a modular finite-alphabet interface by lifting Solovay--Kitaev approximation in $SU(2)$ through two-level embeddings.</description>

      <title>The Compounded BSDE method: A fully-forward method for option pricing and optimal stopping problems in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Compound BSDE method, a fully forward, deep-learning-based approach for solving a broad class of problems in financial mathematics, including optimal stopping. The method is based on a reformulation of option pricing problems in terms of a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), which offers a new perspective on the numerical treatment of compound options and optimal stopping problems such as Bermudan option pricing. Building on the classical deep BSDE method for a single BSDE, we develop an algorithm for compound BSDEs and establish its convergence properties. In particular, we derive an \emph{a posteriori} error estimate for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach, and illustrate its effectiveness for high-dimensional option pricing and optimal stopping problems.</description>

      <title>A Unique Inverse Decomposition of Positive Definite Matrices under Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear decomposition of a positive definite matrix into two components: the inverse of another positive definite matrix and a symmetric matrix constrained to lie in a prescribed linear subspace. Equivalently, the inverse component is required to belong to the orthogonal complement of that subspace with respect to the trace inner product. Under a sharp nondegeneracy condition on the subspace, we show that every positive definite matrix admits a \emph{unique} decomposition of this form.
  This decomposition admits a variational characterization as the unique minimizer of a strictly convex log-determinant optimization problem, which in turn yields a natural dual formulation that can be efficiently exploited computationally. We derive several properties, including the stability of the decomposition.
  We further develop feasibility-preserving Newton-type algorithms with provable convergence guarantees and analyze their per-iteration complexity in terms of algebraic properties of the decomposed matrix and the underlying subspace. Finally, we show that the proposed decomposition arises naturally in exponential utility maximization, a central problem in mathematical finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of real-valued bandlimited signals on graphs, focusing on low-bit representations. We propose iterative noise-shaping algorithms for quantization, including sampling approaches with and without vertex replacement. The methods leverage the spectral properties of the graph Laplacian and exploit graph incoherence to achieve high-fidelity approximations. Theoretical guarantees are provided for the random sampling method, and extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heterogeneous coupling problems on an abstract level, establishing fundamental principles of domain decomposition agnostic to the solvers of the local subproblems. Introducing a coupling framework reminiscent of FETI methods, but here on abstract form, we establish conditions for stability and minimal requirements for well-posedness on the continuous level, as well as conditions on local solvers for the approximation of subproblems. We then discuss stability of the resulting Lagrange multiplier methods and show stability under a mesh condition between the local discretizations and the mortar space. If this condition is not satisfied we show how a stabilization, acting only on the multiplier can be used to achieve stability. The design of preconditioners of the Schur complement system is discussed in the unstabilized case. Finally we discuss some applications that enter the framework.</description>

The existence and uniqueness of the solution for the continuous space-time variational formulation are proven. We prove the existence of the discrete solution and also establish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme. The non-linear system is linearized through Picards method and a suitable preconditioner for the linearized system is provided.

Abstract: This article introduces a class of efficiently computable null patterns for tensor data. The class includes familiar patterns such as block-diagonal decompositions explored in statistics and signal processing, low-rank tensor decompositions, and Tucker decompositions. It also includes a new family of null patterns -- not known to be detectable by current methods -- that can be thought of as continuous decompositions approximating curves and surfaces. We present a general algorithm to detect null patterns in each class using a parameter we call a \textit{chisel} that tunes the search to patterns of a prescribed shape. We also show that the patterns output by the algorithm are essentially unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for a modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck/Navier-Stokes (PNP/NS) model under the mechanical equilibrium, developed for compressible electrolytes. Another key contribution of this work is the reduction of the equilibrium system to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann system. The proposed numerical scheme is capable of handling both compressible and incompressible regimes by employing a bulk modulus parameter, which governs the fluid's compressibility and enables seamless transition between these regimes. To emphasize practical relevance, we discuss the implications of compressible electrolytes in the context of double-layer capacitance behavior. We also conduct numerical simulations over various domains to demonstrate its applicability under various operating conditions, including temperature fluctuations and variations in the bulk modulus. The numerical results validate the accuracy and robustness of our computational scheme and demonstrate that the observed limiting behavior for the incompressible regime aligns with the theoretical trends anticipated by Dreyer et al. [39].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segre-Veronese manifolds are smooth submanifolds of tensors comprising the partially symmetric rank-1 tensors. We investigate a one-parameter family of warped geometries of Segre-Veronese manifolds, which includes the standard Euclidean geometry. This parameter controls by how much spherical tangent directions are weighted relative to radial tangent directions. We present closed expressions for the exponential map, the logarithmic map, and the intrinsic distance on these warped Segre-Veronese manifolds, which can be computed efficiently numerically. It is shown that Segre-Veronese manifolds are not geodesically connected in the Euclidean geometry, while they are for some values of the warping parameter. The benefits of geodesics connectedness may outweigh using the Euclidean geometry in certain applications. One such application is presented: numerically computing the Riemannian center of mass for averaging rank-1 tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm to decompose an exact low-rank skew-symmetric tensor into a sum of elementary (rank-$1$) skew-symmetric tensors is introduced. The algorithm uncovers this Grassmann decomposition based on linear relations that are encoded by the kernel of the differential of the natural action of the general linear group on the tensor, following the ideas of [Brooksbank, Kassabov, and Wilson, Detecting null patterns in tensor data, arXiv:2408.17425v2, 2025]. The Grassmann decomposition can be recovered, up to scale, from a diagonalization of a generic element in this kernel. Numerical experiments illustrate that the algorithm is computationally efficient and quite accurate for mathematically low-rank tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic gradient optimization schemes. Assuming that the objective function is strongly convex, we prove weak error estimates which are uniform in time for the error between the solution of the numerical scheme, and the solutions of continuous-time modified (or high-resolution) differential equations at first and second orders, with respect to the time-step size. At first order, the modified equation is deterministic, whereas at second order the modified equation is stochastic and depends on a modified objective function. We go beyond existing results where the error estimates have been considered only on finite time intervals and were not uniform in time. This allows us to then provide a rigorous complexity analysis of the method in the large time and small time-step size regimes. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the convergence results.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov equations for evaluating the boundary hitting of degenerate diffusion with unsteady drift</title>

Abstract: Jacobi diffusion is a representative diffusion process whose solution is bounded in a domain under certain conditions about drift and diffusion coefficients. However, the process without such conditions has not been investigated well. We explore a Jacobi diffusion whose drift coefficient is affected by another deterministic process, causing the process to hit the boundary of a domain in finite time. The Kolmogorov equation (a degenerate elliptic partial differential equation) for evaluating the boundary hitting of the proposed Jacobi diffusion is then presented and analyzed. We also investigate a related mean-field-type (McKean-Vlasov) self-consistent model arising in tourism management, where the drift depends on the index for sensor boundary hitting, thereby confining the process to a domain with higher probability. We propose a finite difference method for the linear and nonlinear Kolmogorov equations, which yields a unique numerical solution due to discrete ellipticity. Accuracy of the finite difference method critically depends on the regularity of the boundary condition, and the use of high-order discretization is not always effective. Finally, we computationally investigate the mean field effect.</description>

      <title>Low-regularity error estimates of a filtered Lie-Trotter splitting scheme for the Zakharov system in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish error estimates for a fully discrete, filtered Lie splitting scheme applied directly to the Zakharov system -- a model whose solutions may exhibit extremely low regularity in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, we find that the scheme exhibits an \emph{approximately structure-preserving} behavior in the fully discrete setting. Our error analysis relies on multilinear estimates developed within the framework of discrete Bourgain spaces. Specifically, we prove that if the exact solution $(E,z,z_t)$ belongs to $H^{s+r+1/2}\times H^{s+r}\times H^{s+r-1}$, then the numerical error measured in the norm $H^{r+1/2}\times H^{r}\times H^{r-1}$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{s/2}+N^{-s})$ for $s\in(0,2]$, where $r=\max(0,\tfrac d2-1)$ and $N$ denotes the number of spatial grid points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous error estimate for splitting methods applied directly to the original Zakharov system -- without introducing auxiliary variables for reformulating the equations. Such reformulations typically compromise the system's intrinsic geometric structure, whereas our approach preserves it approximately by operating on the system in its native form. Finally, we present numerical experiments that corroborate and illustrate the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization for piecewise parameter identification in inverse diffusion problems with a single boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the reconstruction of a space-dependent parameter in inverse diffusion problems, proposing a shape-optimization-based approach. We consider a Robin boundary condition, physically motivated in diffuse optical tomography to model partial reflection of light at tissue boundaries [Arr99, GFB83a]. This ensures well-posedness of the forward problem, while related inverse problems with Dirichlet or Neumann conditions have also been considered in previous studies [Mef21]. The main objective is to recover the absorption coefficient from a single boundary measurement. While conventional gradient-based methods rely on the Frechet derivative of a cost functional with respect to the unknown parameter, we also utilize its Eulerian derivative with respect to the unknown boundary interface for recovery. This non-conventional approach addresses parameter recovery when only a single boundary measurement can be obtained, providing a method for its reconstruction. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, even for intricate and non-convex boundary interfaces.</description>

      <title>An adaptive multimesh rational approximation scheme for the spectral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a novel multimesh rational approximation scheme for the numerical solution of the (homogeneous) Dirichlet problem for the spectral fractional Laplacian. The scheme combines a rational approximation of the function $\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{-s}$ with a set of finite element approximations of parameter-dependent non-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). The key idea that underpins the proposed scheme is that each parametric PDE is numerically solved on an individually tailored finite element mesh. This is in contrast to the existing single-mesh approach, where the same finite element mesh is employed for solving all parametric PDEs. We develop an a posteriori error estimation strategy for the proposed rational approximation scheme and design an adaptive multimesh refinement algorithm. Numerical experiments show improvements in convergence rates compared to the rates for uniform mesh refinement and up to 10 times reduction in computational costs compared to the corresponding adaptive algorithm in the single-mesh setting.</description>

      <title>A hybrid isogeometric and finite element method: NURBS-enhanced finite element method for hexahedral meshes (NEFEM-HEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a NURBS-enhanced finite element method that integrates NURBS-based boundary representations of geometric domains into standard finite element frameworks applied to hexahedral meshes. We decompose an open, bounded, convex three-dimensional domain with a NURBS boundary into two parts, define the NURBS-enhanced finite elements over the boundary layer, and use piecewise-linear Lagrange finite elements in the interior region. We introduce a novel quadrature rule and a novel interpolation operator for the NURBS-enhanced elements. We derive the stability and approximation properties of the interpolation operators that we use. We describe how the h-refinement in finite element analysis and the knot insertion in isogeometric analysis can be utilized in the refinement of the NURBS-enhanced elements. To illustrate an application of our methodology, we utilize a generic weak formulation of a second-order elliptic PDE and derive a priori error estimates in the $H^{1}$ norm. The proposed methodology combines the efficiency of finite element analysis with the geometric precision of NURBS, and may enable more accurate and efficient simulations over complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for the Arnoldi Approximation of a Matrix Square Root</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Arnoldi process provides an efficient framework for approximating functions of a matrix applied to a vector, i.e., of the form $f(M)\bm{b}$, by repeated matrix-vector multiplications. In this paper, we derive error estimates for approximating the action of a matrix square root using the Arnoldi process, where the integral representation of the error is reformulated in terms of the error for solving the linear system $M\bm{x}=\bm{b}$. The results extend the error analysis of the Lanczos method for Hermitian matrices in [Chen et al., SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2022] to non-Hermitian cases and provide an improved bound for the Hermitian case. Furthermore, in practical settings, the matrix may only be available via approximate or structured representations. Motivated by this, we extend the analysis and establish a generalized error bound for perturbed matrices. The numerical results on matrices with different structures demonstrate that our theoretical analysis yields a reliable upper bound. Finally, simulations on large-scale matrices arising in particulate suspensions, represented in hierarchical matrix form, validate the effectiveness and practicality of the approach.</description>

      <title>An Implicit Two-Stage Fourth-Order Temporal Discretization Scheme of Lax-Wendroff Type for Hydrodynamic Problems with Stiff Source Terms, Part I: Formulation, Stability Analysis, and Newton's Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing two-stage fourth-order (TSFO) methods are confined to explicit frameworks and can only be applied to homogeneous hydrodynamic problems describing idealized states. More importantly, the ability of these methods to achieve fourth-order time accuracy in merely two stages relies on utilizing temporal derivatives of physical quantities, which are obtained through generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solvers. While the advantage of the GRP solvers over traditional Riemann solvers lies precisely in their ability to naturally incorporate the effects of source terms. Specifically, by employing the Lax-Wendroff methodology, the temporal derivatives of physical quantities are converted into spatial derivatives of fluxes and source terms through the governing equations, thereby avoiding errors arising from operator splitting. So that there is an urgent need to extending TSFO methods from explicit frameworks to implicit ones. The present work lays a solid theoretical foundation and provides a concrete implementation pathway for this research direction. Firstly, this paper derives, through rigorous mathematical analysis, an implicit temporal discretization scheme that achieves fourth-order accuracy in just two stages. Subsequently, sufficient conditions for A-stability of the proposed implicit scheme are established via systematic theoretical analysis, and a corresponding Newton iteration procedure is formulated to accelerate convergence. Finally, the proposed implicit scheme is extensively validated using classical stiff benchmark problems, confirming its effectiveness and competitiveness. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme indeed achieves fourth-order time accuracy in two stages and, compared to the classical fourth-order implicit Runge-Kutta method, offers a larger stable time step and smaller convergence error.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural networks for solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical solution of high dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is severely constrained by the curse of dimensionality (CoD), rendering classical grid--based methods impractical beyond a few dimensions. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising mesh free alternative, enabling the approximation of PDE solutions in tens to thousands of dimensions. This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions. For each paradigm, we outline the underlying mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and practical strengths and limitations. Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) numerically by using (possibly random) neural networks in the truncated Wiener chaos expansion of their corresponding solution. Moreover, we provide some approximation rates for learning the solution of SPDEs with additive and/or multiplicative noise. Finally, we apply our results in numerical examples to approximate the solution of three SPDEs: the stochastic heat equation, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation, and the Zakai equation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis for $L^2$-estimates in linear elliptic equations via divergence-free transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an explicit $L^2$-estimate for weak solutions $u$ to linear elliptic equations in divergence form with general coefficients and external source term $f$, stating that the $L^2$-norm of $u$ over $U$ is bounded by a constant multiple of the $L^2$-norm of $f$ over $U$. In contrast to classical approaches based on compactness arguments, the proposed method, which employs a divergence-free transformation method, provides a computable and explicit constant $C&gt;0$. The $L^2$-estimate remains robust even when there is no zero-order term, and the analysis further demonstrates that the constant $C&gt;0$ decreases as the diffusion coefficient or the zero-order term increases. These quantitative results provide a rigorous foundation for applications such as a posteriori error estimates in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where explicit error bounds are essential.</description>

      <title>A Unified Phase-Field Fourier Neural Network Framework for Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Alternating Phase-Field Fourier Neural Networks (APF-FNNs) as a unified and physics-based framework for topology optimization. The approach decouples the design problem by representing the state, adjoint, and topology fields with three separate Fourier neural networks, which are trained via a stable collaborative alternating scheme applicable to both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint problems. To obtain well-resolved designs, the Ginzburg--Landau energy functional is embedded in the loss of the topology network as an intrinsic regularizer, naturally enforcing smooth and distinct interfaces between the two phases. Phase-field updates are driven by adjoint-based optimality conditions, and design sensitivities are evaluated efficiently using automatic differentiation, ensuring that the gradients correspond to exact total derivatives rather than naive partial derivatives. In contrast to classical phase-field methods, APF-FNNs exploit these physically consistent design gradients directly, avoiding pseudo-time gradient-flow solvers. By formulating physics-driven losses from variational principles or strong-form PDE residuals, the framework is broadly applicable to 2D and 3D benchmark problems, including compliance minimization, eigenvalue maximization, and Stokes/Navier--Stokes flow optimization. Across these examples, APF-FNNs consistently yield competitive performance and well-resolved topologies, establishing a versatile and scalable foundation for physics-driven computational design.</description>

      <title>Sprecher Networks: A Parameter-Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sprecher Networks (SNs), a family of trainable architectures derived from David Sprecher's 1965 constructive form of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation. Each SN block implements a "sum of shifted univariate functions" using only two shared learnable splines per block, a monotone inner spline $\phi$ and a general outer spline $\Phi$, together with a learnable shift parameter $\eta$ and a mixing vector $\lambda$ shared across all output dimensions. Stacking these blocks yields deep, compositional models; for vector-valued outputs we append an additional non-summed output block.
  We also propose an optional lateral mixing operator enabling intra-block communication between output channels with only $O(d_{\mathrm{out}})$ additional parameters. Owing to the vector (not matrix) mixing weights and spline sharing, SNs scale linearly in width, approximately $O(\sum_{\ell}(d_{\ell-1}+d_{\ell}+G))$ parameters for $G$ spline knots, versus $O(\sum_{\ell} d_{\ell-1}d_{\ell})$ for dense MLPs and $O(G\sum_{\ell} d_{\ell-1}d_{\ell})$ for edge-spline KANs. This linear width-scaling is particularly attractive for extremely wide, shallow models, where low depth can translate into low inference latency. Finally, we describe a sequential forward implementation that avoids materializing the $d_{\mathrm{in}}\times d_{\mathrm{out}}$ shifted-input tensor, reducing peak forward-intermediate memory from quadratic to linear in layer width, relevant for memory-constrained settings such as on-device/edge inference; we demonstrate deployability via fixed-point real-time digit classification on resource-constrained embedded device with only 4 MB RAM. We provide empirical demonstrations on supervised regression, Fashion-MNIST classification (including stable training at 25 hidden layers with residual connections and normalization), and a Poisson PINN, with controlled comparisons to MLP and KAN baselines.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations appear ubiquitously in scientific computation, ranging from matrix polynomials to differential equations, and are beyond the reach of the quantum singular value transformation framework. In this work, we study the efficiency of quantum algorithms based on contour integral representation for eigenvalue transformations from both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretically, we establish a complete complexity analysis of the contour integral approach proposed in [Takahira, Ohashi, Sogabe, and Usuda. Quant. Inf. Comput., 22, 11\&amp;12, 965--979 (2021)]. Moreover, we combine the contour integral approach and the sampling-based linear combination of unitaries to propose a quantum algorithm for estimating observables of eigenvalue transformations using only $3$ additional qubits. Practically, we design contour integral based quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation, matrix polynomials, and solving linear ordinary differential equations, and show that the contour integral algorithm can outperform all the existing quantum algorithms in the case of solving asymptotically stable differential equations.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>
