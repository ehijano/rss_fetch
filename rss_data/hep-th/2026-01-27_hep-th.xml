      <title>Worldline-Induced Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Unruh response can be interferometrically suppressed or restored in a single Unruh--DeWitt detector whose center-of-mass is prepared in a coherent superposition of two uniformly accelerated worldlines. The two paths remain physically disjoint; the detector is read out in a path-erasing basis so that no which-path information is revealed. If the detector's energy gap is path dependent during the interaction, the branch amplitudes for first-order excitation become operationally indistinguishable and therefore add coherently. With appropriate tuning -- matching the gap-to-acceleration ratios of the two branches and choosing a single relative phase -- the conditional first-order excitation amplitude cancels, while reversing the phase restores the response. We derive these conditions in two complementary formalisms and interpret the mechanism as a relativistic analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency, which we term worldline-induced transparency. We also treat finite switching times explicitly and quantify how imperfect matching produces a residual signal, yielding a tolerance window rather than an idealized infinitely sharp condition.</description>

      <title>An M2/M5 Duality from the Giant Graviton Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture a precise relation between the superconformal indices of two theories defined in different spacetime dimensions. The first is the three-dimensional ABJM theory describing the worldvolume of parallel M2-branes in M-theory on $\mathbb{R}^{10,1}$. The second is the $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory in six dimensions which describes the worldvolume of parallel M5-branes in the same background. As we review, the existence of such a duality is closely related to Imamura's proposal for the giant graviton expansion of the three-dimensional index. We check our conjecture against various results for the two indices available in the literature. Using an existing proposal of Hristov for the ABJM superconformal index, we verify our conjecture to the first three orders in an expansion around the six-dimensional Cardy limit.</description>

      <title>Fortuitous Chaos, BPS Black Holes, and Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``fortuitous'' Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) sector states in gauge theory have been argued to furnish a description, through holography, of generic BPS black hole microstates. They are expected to be strongly chaotic, a necessary feature to capture the black hole dynamics. This dovetails nicely with the existence of various random matrix models of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, within which the BPS chaos must be contained as a subsector. This paper identifies and studies a simple random matrix model that underlies all known random matrix models of JT supergravity. It is argued that it captures many essential universal features of fortuitous BPS chaos. The model is topological, naturally interpolating between the Bessel and Airy models, where the gap energy $E_0$ controls the interpolation, and seems to have a simple intersection theory interpretation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Tomography of Flux Tubes in (2+1)D Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entangling properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory. In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\le N_c\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $\xi_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $\xi_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both R\'{e}nyi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $\lambda$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.</description>

      <title>Nested ansatz method for Baker-Akhiezer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain that the logic behind the derivation of the Noumi-Shiraishi function can be applied directly to the Baker-Akhiezer function (BAF). This amounts to changing an ansatz for BAF to a nested one, where the BAF of N + 1 variables is recursively expressed as a sum over BAFs of N variables. This may be seen as a generalization of symmetrization trick from [1], but for the generally non-symmetric BAF. We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1].</description>

      <title>Scattering angle at 3PM in scalar-tensor theories using the PM-EFT formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive the conservative dynamics of non-spinning binaries in the massless scalar-tensor theories using the post-Minkowskian Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach. Our main result is an analytic expression of the scattering angle, computed up to third Post-Minkowskian order via two-loop Feynman diagrams. Our results are in perfect agreement with previous literature, in particular within the post-Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Probing sine dilaton gravity with flow central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a holographic c-function for sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the domain wall gauge. We show the equivalence between sDG and the two copies of Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) and compute the associated central charge. We reproduce the central charge of LCFT from the holographic c-function of sDG corresponding to the UV limit. In contrast, in the deep IR limit, the c-function flows to the pure JT gravity, where the central charge becomes identically zero.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the power spectral density of time delay fluctuations in an interferometer as a potential low-energy quantum gravitational observable. We derive a general expression for the spectrum in terms of the Wightman function of linear metric perturbations, which we then apply to a variety of cases. We analyze the intrinsic graviton fluctuations in the vacuum, thermal, and squeezed states, as well as the fluctuations induced by the vacuum stress-energy of a massless scalar field. We find that the resulting spectra are free of ultraviolet divergences and that, while thermal and squeezed states provide a natural amplification mechanism, the spectra remain suppressed by the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative double copy: worldline instantons, color thermality, and backreaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles, non-perturbative worldline instanton analysis of vacuum decay in the non-abelian Yang-Mills root of a Schwarzschild background. We recover the gauge theory color-thermal spectrum as a topological winding mode. The double copy maps vacuum response from the gauge theory directly to the gravity theory. Furthermore, the decay exponent acquires a universal quadratic correction from color charge conservation, showing that the double copy correctly captures the non-linear backreaction as required for unitarity.</description>

      <title>Novel five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes with electric and axionic charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a new family of exact charged and rotating asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in five dimensions. The spacetime solves Einstein equations coupled to a dilaton, two Abelian gauge fields, and axionic scalars supplemented by two generalized Chern-Simons terms. This configuration is characterized by a range of the free dynamical exponent $z$ and possesses nontrivial thermodynamical parameters, where we verify the first law of black hole thermodynamics and derive the corresponding Smarr relation. Motivated by applications to gauge/gravity duality, we then investigate a holographic superconductor in the rotating Lifshitz background. We study the condensation of the scalar operator and the AC conductivity of the dual system. These results show that increasing the rotation parameter suppresses the condensate and weakens the superconducting phase, while increasing the dynamical critical exponent enhances the superconducting order. To the best of our knowledge, the solutions presented here are the first to demonstrate five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes supported by both electric and axionic charges. This opens up a new avenue to investigate non-relativistic holography beyond static backgrounds.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>

      <title>The Regge-Gribov model with odderons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model describing interacting pomerons and odderons is proposed with triple reggeon vertices taking into account the negative signature of the odderon. Its simplified version with zero transverse dimensions is first considered. No phase transition occurs in this case at the intercept crossing unity. This simplified model is studied without more approximations by numerical techniques. The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. Five real fixed points are found with singularities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition as the intercepts cross unity. The new phases, however, are not physical, since they violate the projectile-target symmetry. In the vicinity of fixed points the asymptotical behaviour of Green functions and elastic scattering amplitude is found under Glauber approximation for couplings to participants.</description>

      <title>Nonanalytic Structure of Effective Potential at Finite Temperature on Compactified Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We thoroughly investigate nonanalytic terms in the finite-temperature effective potential in one-loop approximation on a $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}\times R^{D-(p+1)}\times \prod_{i=1}^p S_i^1$, using a mode recombination formula. Such nonanalytic terms cannot be expressed as positive powers of field-dependent mass squared. The formula provides a clear separation of the effective potential into a part that contains the nonanalytic terms and a part that is purely analytic, and clarifies the origin of the nonanalytic terms. We obtain all the nonanalytic terms and show that only two types of nonanalytic terms arise: power-type and logarithmic-one. For a real scalar field with periodic boundary conditions, the manner of the emergence of these terms is highly characteristic; the two types never appear simultaneously. By contrast, for fermions with general boundary conditions, we find that neither of the two types appears. These results clarify the nonanalytic structure of the finite-temperature effective potential on the spacetime with compactified spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and subregion complexity with scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE) and timelike subregion complexity of a thermal CFT$_d$ deformed by a relevant scalar operator $\phi_0$, dual to a hairy black hole in AdS$_{d+1}$. We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $\Delta t$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $\Delta t$. At small $\Delta t$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone.</description>

Abstract: We establish time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) as a novel tool to characterize the black hole interior from a single-boundary perspective. In the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, we show that TEE of time-like boundary strips exhibits linear growth as a function of temporal width in the limit of large temporal width, and that its imaginary part carries physical significance rather than being a constant. By analyzing charged, scalar-hairy black holes, we present evidence that TEE detects a hidden "causal phase transition" separating Type-I and Type-II interiors -- distinguished by singularity structure. We identify a critical temporal width $\tau_c$ that acts as the order parameter for this transition: for strips narrower than $\tau_c$, the system enters a distinct "time-like entanglement phase" dominated purely by time-like contributions, up to a regulator effect; conversely, for strips wider than $\tau_c$, space-like entanglement re-emerges. Notably, the existence of a Cauchy horizon drives the $\tau_c$ to infinity, leading to pure time-like entanglement. These results suggest that the TEE may supply a novel boundary quantum-information measure to detect structure hidden inside the black hole and suggests a deep connection between TEE and cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in a momentum-space Daubechies wavelet basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to investigate nonperturbative dynamics within the Hamiltonian framework. In particular, we employ Daubechies wavelets in momentum space, whose basis functions are labeled by resolution and translation indices, providing a natural nonperturbative truncation of both infrared and ultraviolet truncation of quantum field theories. As an application, we compute the energy spectra of a free scalar field theory and the interacting $1+1$-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. This approach successfully reproduces the well-known strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2 &gt; 0$ regime. We find that the extracted critical coupling systematically converges toward its established value as the momentum resolution is increased, demonstrating the effectiveness of the wavelet-based Hamiltonian formulation for nonperturbative field-theoretic calculations.</description>

      <title>Constraining bulk-to-boundary correlators in the theories with Poincar\'e symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a general two-point function cannot be uniquely determined in a theory with Poincar\'e symmetry. In this paper, we show that bulk-to-boundary correlators are highly constrained after imposing suitable fall-off conditions near future/past null infinity. More precisely, scalar bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a unique form up to a normalization constant, whereas fermionic bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a linear superposition of scalar and fermionic branches. This is established by asymptotically expanding the Ward identities, where upon the leading terms decouple from the subleading ones. In the fermionic branch, the power-law exponent of the bulk-to-boundary correlator is greater by one than the fall-off index. Consequently, we revisit the relation between Carrollian correlators and momentum space scattering amplitudes for fermionic operators. In this context, we find that the Fourier transform bridging the two acquires an extra factor of $\sqrt{\omega}$ for each fermionic operator. Furthermore, we reduce the bulk-to-boundary correlator to the boundary-to-boundary correlator and identify a critical fall-off index $\Delta=1$. For $0 \le \Delta &lt; 1$, only a magnetic branch exists for scalars. For $\Delta &gt; 1$, the electric branch is always divergent for both scalar and fermionic branches and thus requires regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the intertwiner operator method of arXiv:2411.08865 to topological field theories, including BF theories, Chern-Simons theory, and three-dimensional gravity. We construct the operator on foliated manifolds while preserving covariance on the Cauchy surface, and compare canonical and holomorphic quantization, providing the intertwiner in both frameworks. For three-dimensional gravity, we present both covariant and time-gauge formulations, analyze the constraints, and construct the corresponding intertwiner. As an application, we derive the path ordering of Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theory. The study of observables is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Duality in $SIM(2)$ topologically massive models with $B\wedge F$ term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the classical duality between the $SIM(2)$-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond (MKR) theory and a self-dual non-gauge-invariant model. First, we establish the equivalence in the free-field case using two complementary methods: a direct comparison of the equations of motion and the master Lagrangian approach. In both methodologies, we verify that the classical correspondence between the MKR model and self-dual fields exhibits modifications induced by very special relativity (VSR). Moreover, we employ the master Lagrangian approach to examine the duality when the self-dual model is minimally coupled to fermionic matter. We show that the resulting MKR model contains Thirring-like interactions modified by nonlocal contributions arising from VSR.</description>

      <title>D1-D5 CFT data from $AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude has recently been generalized to the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence between type IIB string theory on $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times K3$ (or $T^4$), supported by Ramond-Ramond flux, and the D1-D5 CFT. In this paper, we use the $ AdS\times S$ Virasoro-Shapiro machinery to extract strong-coupling CFT data of the D1-D5 CFT by extending and completing earlier analyses in several directions. First, starting from the superconformal/Mellin block expansion of four-point functions of half-BPS tensor operators with arbitrary external KK modes, we employ the full $ AdS\times S$ Mellin formalism to bootstrap the $ AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for general KK configurations. This establishes its consistency with superconformal symmetry and yields a wealth of additional CFT data naturally organized in internal Mellin space. Second, we push the computation to the next order in the strong-coupling expansion and extract additional higher-order CFT data. Third, we translate the resulting Mellin-space data into the internal spin basis. We derive the transformation kernel relating internal Mellin variables and $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry spins. As applications, we obtain explicit formulae for the scaling dimensions of long multiplets on the first two leading Regge trajectories of arbitrary internal spins, and certain three-point functions with half-BPS tensor operators. These results provide a valuable set of analytic D1-D5 CFT data, enabling future applications and direct comparison with complementary approaches such as integrability.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Analysis of Doubled 4d Chern-Simons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture that doubled four-dimensional Chern-Simons produces new integrable models, we perform its Hamiltonian analysis and find the theory's Poisson algebra. This requires carefully accounting for a set of boundary conditions that identify two gauge fields. Two methods for doing so are given, one of which is based on edge-modes and the other on a recharacterisation of the boundary conditions as constraints. We find that the Poisson algebra is that of an affine Gaudin model subject to a constraint, generalising the Goddard-Kent-Olive construction (from conformal field theory) to the world of integrable models. We also conjecture the existence of extended quantum groups and a generalisation of the affine Harish-Chandra Isomorphism.</description>

      <title>RG flows of minimal $\mathcal W$-algebra CFTs via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we study renormalization group (RG) flows between 2d conformal field theories enjoying extended higher-spin $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry. We propose a new class of RG flows between the diagonal minimal models of $\mathcal{W}_N$-algebra that take the form $\mathcal{W}_N(p,q)\to\mathcal{W}_N(p,kp-q)$. These are obtained by matching the anomalies of the non-invertible symmetry ${\mathrm{Rep}}[SU(N)_{p-N}]$ (and its discrete quotients) that is preserved by special relevant primary fields. This large non-invertible symmetry includes the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry of the minimal models. Our new flows furnish a significant generalization of the ones recently found in the case of Virasoro algebra, and include all previously known RG flows of $\mathcal{W}_N$. They have the remarkable property of being uniform in the rank $N$ of the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Holography with an Inner Boundary: A Smooth Horizon as a Sum over Horizonless States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (holomorphic) partition function of the Euclidean BTZ black hole with boundary modulus $\tau$, is the $S$-image of the Virasoro vacuum character, $\chi_{\rm vac}(-1/\tau)$. This object decomposes into primaries via the modular $S$-kernel: $\chi_{\rm vac}\left(-\frac{1}{\tau}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty} dP S_{0P}(P,c)\chi_P(\tau)$. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of this spectral resolution using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with $two$ boundaries: an asymptotic torus and an excised Wilson line at the origin ("stretched horizon"). At infinity, we impose standard AdS$_3$ Drinfel'd-Sokolov (DS) gauge to obtain the Alekseev-Shatashvili (AS) boundary action for a coadjoint orbit. At the inner boundary, removing the Wilson line prepares the state at the cut as a sum over orbits of the $spatial$ cycle. Re-inserting a spatial holonomy Wilson line acts as a delta-function projector onto the corresponding primary, which together with boundary gravitons, reproduces the Virasoro character (e.g., of a conical defect). But we can also consider projectors onto the $conjugate$ basis $\tilde P$, of the dual cycle. A key observation is that this leads to $S$-kernels instead of delta functions, with the BTZ character arising when the dual cycle label is in the exceptional orbit. Our two-boundary construction provides a bulk understanding of BTZ entropy: holonomy zero modes at the horizon have an effective central charge $c_{\rm prim}=c-1$ from the kernel measure (primaries), while the universal Dedekind-$\eta$ in $\chi_P(\tau)$ contributes $c_{\rm desc}=1$ from boundary gravitons (descendants). Together, they reproduce the full Cardy entropy. While our methods are specific to AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, they are an explicit illustration that smoothness of the (Euclidean) horizon may emerge from a $sum$ over bulk states which are manifestly unsmooth.</description>

      <title>Artificial Entanglement in the Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be adapted to new tasks using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that modify only a small number of trainable parameters, often through low-rank updates. In this work, we adopt a quantum-information-inspired perspective to understand their effectiveness. From this perspective, low-rank parameterizations naturally correspond to low-dimensional Matrix Product States (MPS) representations, which enable entanglement-based characterizations of parameter structure. Thereby, we term and measure "Artificial Entanglement", defined as the entanglement entropy of the parameters in artificial neural networks (in particular the LLMs). We first study the representative low-rank adaptation (LoRA) PEFT method, alongside full fine-tuning (FFT), using LLaMA models at the 1B and 8B scales trained on the Tulu3 and OpenThoughts3 datasets, and uncover: (i) Internal artificial entanglement in the updates of query and value projection matrices in LoRA follows a volume law with a central suppression (termed as the "Entanglement Valley"), which is sensitive to hyper-parameters and is distinct from that in FFT; (ii) External artificial entanglement in attention matrices, corresponding to token-token correlations in representation space, follows an area law with logarithmic corrections and remains robust to LoRA hyper-parameters and training steps. Drawing a parallel to the No-Hair Theorem in black hole physics, we propose that although LoRA and FFT induce distinct internal entanglement signatures, such differences do not manifest in the attention outputs, suggesting a "no-hair" property that results in the effectiveness of low rank updates. We further provide theoretical support based on random matrix theory, and extend our analysis to an MPS Adaptation PEFT method, which exhibits qualitatively similar behaviors.</description>

      <title>Effective geometrodynamics for renormalization-group improved black-hole spacetimes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spherically reduced Einstein-Hilbert action, Einstein field equations and Schwarzschild spacetime modified by a renormalization-group (RG) scale-dependent gravitational Newton coupling, and present a systematic and operational approach to such an RG-improvement. The master field equations for spherically symmetric gravitational fields, recently constructed from two-dimensional Horndeski theory, allow us to retain partial contributions from higher-curvature truncations of the effective action, while preserving the second-order nature of the resulting field equations. Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability. This formalism moreover allows us to establish explicitly the discrepancies in the outcomes of RG-improvement when implemented at the level of the action, in the field equations, or in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

Abstract: We study cosmological models using dynamical systems and averaging methods, encompassing flat and open FLRW geometries as well as the LRS Bianchi types I, III, and V. Under mild regularity and frequency-scaling assumptions, we obtain a near-identity conjugacy between the oscillatory flow and an averaged slow flow, with $\| \mathbf{x}(t)-\bar {\mathbf{x}}(t)\| =\mathcal{O}(H(t))$. The effective systems preserve the original asymptotics and yield geometry-dependent late-time attractor classifications. A corollary addresses the case in which the leading averaged vector field vanishes, so the system exhibits no autonomous drift at order $H^0$.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Induced Skin Effect in Electron Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultra-clean 2d materials electron viscosity is as important as Ohmic dissipation and electron transport exhibits hydrodynamic features. Using a simple framework of Brinkman equations we find that hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect: sharp obstacles locally enhance the current suppressing it far from the edges where the flow is unobstructed. This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries. By comparing with recent scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene, we demonstrate that such flow patterns are consistent with viscous hydrodynamics shaped by geometry, clarifying the role of geometric effects in the interpretation of electronic flow experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric formulation of heavy-quark transitions in which infrared-dressed states are adiabatically transported in the multidimensional recoil space and acquire Berry holonomies. Within this framework, single-step decays are governed by an abelian geometric phase and reproduce the standard Isgur-Wise behaviour, while sequential decays probe genuinely non-Abelian holonomies associated with a two-dimensional recoil space. The resulting geometric structure correlates different decay channels and provides a unified interpretation of mixing effects and quasi-degenerate states in heavy-quark phenomenology. This approach suggests that several long-standing puzzles arise as geometric consequences of infrared dressing rather than as accidental features of the microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a diagnostic tool, a temperature estimator, for lattice gauge theory simulations. The estimator is obtained from the gradient and the Hessian of the Euclidean lattice action. It is gauge invariant, configuration-based, and independent of momentum-space information. These features enable direct checks of thermodynamic consistency in Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this tool to compact U(1) lattice gauge theories in one, two, and four dimensions. The results confirm the proposed estimator's ability to reproduce the input temperatures across different lattice ensembles. The estimator is sensitive to sampling inefficiencies and algorithmic artifacts, making it a useful diagnostic for large-scale simulations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by quantum-gravity scenarios that replace the classical black hole singularity with a regular core, and by the possibility that the dark-energy sector may be scale dependent, we construct a broad class of nonsingular rotating black-hole spacetimes embedded in an improved de Sitter--like background with either constant or running $\Lambda$. Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\Lambda$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\Lambda$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\Lambda$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.</description>

      <title>From Thermodynamic Criticality to Geometric Criticality: A Linear Kernel Map from Matter Susceptibilities to Black-Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit linear map from compact, conserved thermodynamic/effective-medium perturbations of the stress-energy tensor to the metric response in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, and from there to geometric observables of direct relevance to horizon-scale imaging: the shadow radius and photon-sphere frequency. The response is expressed through $L^{1}$-bounded kernels written in a piecewise "local $+$ tail" form, which makes transparent the separation between near-photon-sphere sensitivity and far-zone contributions (including AdS tails). Under mild assumptions on the matter susceptibilities near a critical point, dominated convergence transfers the thermodynamic exponent to the geometric susceptibility, $\gamma_{\rm sh}=\gamma_{\rm th}$, with controlled analytic corrections. We further provide AdS far-zone bounds with explicit outside-support constants depending only on background geometric data at the photon sphere and shell geometry. A reproducible numerical pipeline with convergence diagnostics is presented and benchmarked.</description>

      <title>The neutrino behavior in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee gravity around global monopole field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17696v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the neutrino oscillation phase propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino oscillation probability is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { \mu }$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Generation of gravitating solutions with Baryonic charge from Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish, for the first time, an exact correspondence between Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theory and gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models in (3+1) dimensions. By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

Abstract: We study BPS $q$-series associated to 3-manifolds decorated by a line defect along an embedded link. We prove that these $q$-series depend only on the class of the link in the skein module, thereby defining a homomorphism from the skein module to the space of $q$-series. The image of this homomorphism is conjectured to be holomorphically quantum modular, which suggests a new approach to Langlands duality for skein modules through $q$-series.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\sim 40\ \text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\sim 10^{-4}\ \msun$ and radius $\sim 1\ \text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Gluing different gravitational models: $f(R)$ case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of junction conditions for gluing different $f(R)$ gravitational theories across a non-null hypersurface. Using the variational approach, we systematically derive the junction conditions for both general $f(R)$ theories and the special case of Einstein gravity, for comparison. We demonstrate that when joining two distinct $f(R)$ theories, the junction conditions require continuity of $\partial f(R)/\partial R$, the extrinsic curvature $K_{\mu \nu}$, while allowing for discontinuities in the Ricci Scalar $R$. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between Jordan and Einstein frame formulations through careful treatment of conformal transformations; Our results reveal that different $f(R)$ theories can be consistently matched provided specific relations between their functional forms and geometric quantities are satisfied at the interface.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ai, Cruz, Garbrecht, and Tamarit (ACGT)~\cite{Ai:2020ptm, Ai:2024vfa, Ai:2024cnp, Ai:2025quf} claimed that there is no strong CP problem by adopting a new order of limits in the volume and topological sector. We critically examine this proposal by focusing on simple one-dimensional quantum mechanics on a ring. We demonstrate that consistent results are obtained only when one sums over all topological sectors \textit{before} taking the large $T$ limit. This observation justifies the conventional path integral formulation of gauge theories and implies that the strong CP problem does exist in QCD.</description>

      <title>Physical Features of Geometrically Deformed Anisotropic Charged Three-dimensional BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work employs the minimal geometric deformation decoupling scheme to derive interior stellar solutions in the background of an electrically charged BTZ ansatz as a seed metric in three dimensions. In this respect, we impose two different equations of state to determine the deformation function and the new material contributions emerging from the additional field source. Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes. The gravitational perturbations in higher-dimensional black holes can be classified into scalar, vector, and tensor types. Considering the dimension-dependent forms of their effective potentials, the correspondence was examined for each dimension and perturbation mode. The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases. The breakdown of the correspondence was rigorously demonstrated to stem from multiple potential barriers, and its applicability to each mode in higher dimensions was assessed.</description>

      <title>Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter. The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\mathbf{M}=1.07\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\mathbf{M}=1.01\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on compact two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience the competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$ (closed manifolds), and bounded cylinder $S^1 \times [0,H]$ (manifold with boundary). Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction accompanied by spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry: order emerges from the combination of two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with the manifold topology determining the character of the emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures, specifically bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. The symmetry breaking pattern depends on topology: SO(3)$\to$SO(2) on the sphere, SO(2)$\times$SO(2)$\to$SO(2)$\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the torus, and SO(2)$\to\mathbb{Z}_2$ on the cylinder. Unlike conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise through type-A diffusive Nambu-Goldstone dynamics, while the reduced-dimensional structure persists. Unlike conventional self-organizing systems that require external driving or fine-tuned nonlinearities, our model demonstrates that geometry and topology alone can channel randomness into order. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems, providing a geometric framework for understanding how disorder generates emergent spatial order on curved spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a localization formula for certain integrals on odd-dimensional manifolds with boundaries, equipped with a Killing vector, and employ this to localize the regularised on-shell action of a large class of supersymmetric solutions of five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity. Specifically, we consider asymptotically AdS_5
  solutions in the time-like class, in which the transverse K\"ahler foliation is assumed to be toric. We find that the background subtraction regularization method leads to an intriguing formula for the on-shell action, in terms of an analytic continuation of the Martelli-Sparks-Yau Sasakian volume. In particular, we show that the regularised on-shell action is
  a function of the toric data of an effective compact five-dimensional manifold, as well as of the supersymmetric Killing vector, outside the corresponding dual cone. As our main example we provide a derivation of the well-known entropy function of supersymmetric and rotating black holes in AdS_5, using only topological data.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed differential homotopy approach to the analysis of nonlinear higher spin theory is developed. The Ansatz is extended to the form applicable in the second order of the perturbation theory and general star-multiplication formulae are derived. The relation of the shifted homotopy and differential homotopy formalisms is worked out. Projectively-compact spin-local quadratic (anti)holomorphic vertices in the one-form sector of higher-spin equations are obtained within the differential homotopy formalism.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle tunnelling in two coupled chiral SYK model</title>

Abstract: The chiral SYK model is an 1+1 dimensional generalisation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions and homogeneous random interactions. In the large N limit, the model admits an exact solution of the two-point function due to its scaling symmetry and exhibits a quantised thermal Hall conductance consistent with that of a 2+1 dimensional gapped topological system. We study two chiral SYK systems coupled by a relevant quadratic interaction that explicitly breaks scaling and time reversal symmetry. Working in the regime of weak intersystem coupling, we solve the Dyson-Schwinger equations perturbatively and obtain analytic expressions for two-point functions at finite temperature. Unlike the coupled SYK model in 0+1 dimensions, the 1+1 dimensional chiral system does not develop a mass gap, and no thermal phase transition is observed. We show that the leading correction to the thermodynamic free energy is temperature-independent, implying that the entropy density remains identical to that of two uncoupled chiral SYK systems. A real-time analysis of the retarded correlator reveals the emergence of massless collective bosonic modes propagating between the two subsystems at zero temperature, signalling quasiparticle tunnelling without gap generation. Our results demonstrate a sharp qualitative distinction between relevant deformations of SYK models in zero and one spatial dimensions, and highlight the robustness of gapless chiral edge dynamics against explicit scaling symmetry-breaking interactions.</description>

      <title>Operator lift of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to Khovanov-Rozansky TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a powerful tool to describe homologies, which normally involve complexes and a variety of maps/morphisms, what makes a functional integration approach with a sum over a single kind of maps seemingly problematic. In TQFT this problem is overcame by exploiting the rich set of zero modes of BRST operators, which appear sufficient to describe complexes. We explain what this approach looks like for the important class of Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) cohomologies, which categorify the observables (Wilson lines or knot polynomials) in 3d Chern-Simons theory. We develop a construction of odd differential operators, associated with all link diagrams, including tangles with open ends. These operators become nilpotent only for diagram with no external legs, but even for open tangles one can develop a factorization formalism, which preserve Reidemeister/topological invariance -- the symmetry of the problem. This technique seems much more ``physical'' than conventional language of homological algebra and should have many applications to various problems beyond Chern-Simons theory. We also hope that this language will provide efficient algorithms, and finally allow to computerize the calculation of KR cohomologies -- for closed diagrams and for open tangles.</description>

      <title>Holographic Extended Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, in the fixed $(\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, the dual CFT exhibits a Hawking-Page-type transition. However, in the fixed $(p,C)$ ensemble, the deformation parameter leads to a distinct thermodynamic behaviour in which multiple branches become unstable, leaving a single thermodynamically stable phase, thus marking a clear departure from the standard van der Waals scenario. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry for higher and noninvertible symmetries</title>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We discuss applications of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating extension of QED characterized by the addition of the term proportional to the antisymmetric tensor $H_{\mu\nu}$. Unlike other LV extensions of QED, in our case, the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like action turns out to include only odd powers of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Our result is shown to be UV finite, and it is confirmed using the Feynman diagrams framework.</description>

Abstract: We recently described a cosmological quantum spacetime of vanishing spatial curvature, which can be considered as background for the IKKT matrix model, assuming that the resulting gauge theory couples weakly. Building on this example, we construct a large class of spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes. We also elaborate on various details of their algebraic and semi-classical structure as well as the higher spin modes present in these models. In particular, we introduce the notion of approximate diffeomorphisms on the cosmological quantum spacetimes that stem from gauge transformations of the underlying matrix model, and investigate how different gauges are related in the semi-classical regime by approximate diffeomorphisms. Finally, we briefly outline how the described quantum spacetimes could be incorporated into the full IKKT model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum groups have a long and fruitful history of applications in integrable systems. Can quantum group symmetries exist in the absence of integrability? We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect at cosmological level of the extra contribution arising from the Geodetic Brane Gravity model within a thermodynamical perspective. As already known, the universe seen as an extended object embedded within a higher dimensional space time, modifies the dynamical background equations, which in turn results in correction contributions to the entropy and temperature of the apparent horizon. Additionally, we investigate the possibility that the apparent horizon and the bulk remain in thermal equilibrium across various matter contents, demonstrating that such properties are highly sensitive to the equation-of-state parameter.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We study the correlation functions between the dynamical variables and between their conjugate momenta at sites of a harmonic lattice in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that at the thermodynamic limit, they can be expressed in terms of Lauricella's C-type hypergeometric series. Furthermore, using these expressions, we explicitly demonstrate that the correlators near the center of the lattice satisfying Diriclet boundary conditions coincide with those for the lattice with the periodic boundary conditions. By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Critical Behavior in AdS Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory via Holographic Entanglement Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic mixed-state entanglement measures in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory. Several quantities are computed, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity ($v_B$). Our findings demonstrate that these measures can effectively diagnose phase transitions. Notably, EWCS and MI, as mixed-state entanglement measures, exhibit behavior opposite to that of the HEE. Additionally, we study the butterfly velocity, a dynamic quantum information measure, and observe that it behaves differently from the static quantum information measures. We propose that the butterfly velocity is initially dominated by entanglement and subsequently by thermal entropy as the coupling constant increases. Moreover, we examine the scaling behavior of the holographic entanglement measures and find that all the critical exponents are equal to $1$, which is twice that of the scalar field. We also explore the inequality between EWCS and MI, noting that the growth rate of MI consistently exceeds that of EWCS during phase transitions. These features are expected to be universal across thermodynamic phase transitions, with the inequalities becoming more significant as one moves away from the critical point.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Metal-Insulator and Hawking-Page Transitions: A Mixed-State Entanglement Perspective in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixed-state entanglement measures in Einstein-Born-Infeld (EN-BI) massive gravity theory, a model exhibiting both Hawking-Page transitions and metal-insulator transitions (MIT) at finite temperatures. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), a novel mixed-state entanglement measure, demonstrates unique properties in detecting phase transitions. For MIT, we find the higher-order terms of EWCS align closely with the critical point, outperforming measures like holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and mutual information (MI) in finite temperature systems. This enhanced sensitivity provides a more accurate tool for probing quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. In Hawking-Page transitions, we observe that all entanglement measures effectively diagnose both first-order and second-order phase transitions, with EWCS showing configuration-independent behavior. Importantly, we discover that all geometry-related quantities, including entanglement measures, demonstrate a universal critical exponent of 1/3 near the second-order phase transition point, suggesting fundamental connections between quantum information theory and critical phenomena in gravitational systems. Our results highlight EWCS's potential as a powerful probe for phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to compute non-perturbative 5-point scattering amplitudes and apply it to gravitational waveforms in the two-body problem for arbitrary trajectories. Drawing inspiration from Feshbach's projector formalism in nuclear physics, we introduce effective potentials governing graviton emission and relate them to perturbative scattering amplitudes at arbitrary order in the gravitational coupling and mass ratio. Once these potentials are determined, the corresponding non-perturbative amplitudes in the classical limit are obtained by iterative insertions and subsequently translated into gravitational waveforms using the KMOC formalism. As an application, we compute the gravitational waveform emitted by a conservative two-body dynamics moving along a generic, potentially highly bent, trajectory. Our formalism extends effective field theory matching of the gravitational two-body potential to radiative phenomena, enabling the extraction of gravitational-wave source terms directly from perturbative on-shell amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators of Giant Gravitons in Monodromy Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute holographically correlation functions for giant gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in the presence of monodromy defects through probe branes. The computation boils down to the study of charged geodesics in certain five-dimensional gauged supergravity backgrounds. In addition to the standard U-shaped geodesic, in the presence of the defect, we find an extra, novel, contribution from a geodesic anchored at the defect which captures the one-point function of the square of the giant graviton.</description>

      <title>BRST methods for constructing quartic actions for spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic approach to the computation of gauge invariant quartic interactions between reducible massive and massless higher spin fields. Extending the BRST formulation of existing cubic results, we obtain a single constraint for each off-shell quartic vertex that ensures both the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian and associativity of the gauge transformations at quartic order. A solution to these equations is presented. The general equation is then reduced to an on-shell version to reduce complexity. We find example solutions for the off-shell and on-shell quartic vertices in low spin examples relevant to the problem of black hole scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kind of Dark Matter: Derivative Portal Dark Matter. This kind of Dark Matter connects to the Standard Model through a massive mediator, which links to the Standard Model in derivative form. The derivative of a mediator in momentum space corresponds to the mediated momentum, which vanishes in the zero momentum transfer limit. As a result, this kind of Dark Matter can evade stringent constraint from the Dark Matter direct detection while fitting the Dark Matter relic density observation naturally. We explore several UV complete models of this kind of Dark matter. What's more, we show that these models also survive from Dark Matter indirect detection and collider search.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras for 3-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of AQFTs and prefactorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the equivalence problem between algebraic quantum field theories and prefactorization algebras defined over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We develop a radically new approach whose main innovative features are 1.) a structural implementation of the additivity property used in earlier approaches and 2.) a reduction of the global equivalence problem to a family of simpler spacetime-wise problems. When applied to the case where the target category is a symmetric monoidal $1$-category, this yields a generalization of the equivalence theorem from [Commun. Math. Phys. 377, 971 (2019)]. In the case where the target is the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of cochain complexes, we obtain a reduction of the global $\infty$-categorical equivalence problem to simpler, but still challenging, spacetime-wise problems. The latter would be solved by showing that certain functors between $1$-categories exhibit $\infty$-localizations, however the available detection criteria are inconclusive in our case.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>A Photon Cloud Induced from an Axion Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the axion-photon coupling can lead to quantum stimulated emission of photons and classic exponential amplification of electromagnetic (EM) fields at half the axion mass frequency, when the axion density or the coupling constant is sufficiently large. In this work, we studied the EM photon cloud induced from an axion cloud around a Kerr black hole in the first order of the coupling constant classically. In the presence of a static EM background (such as the extended Wald solution motivated by astrophysical environments), we found that an EM photon cloud emerges, oscillating at the same frequency as the axion cloud and growing exponentially in accordance with the axion cloud when the superradiant condition for the axion field is satisfied. The evolution of the EM photon cloud with time and azimuthal angle is obtained analytically while the cross-sectional distribution is solved numerically. The induced EM field exhibits symmetries that are markedly different from those of the background EM field. Consequently, the induced photon cloud forms an unstable bound configuration that emits EM waves to spatial infinity while being replenished by the axion cloud, providing a potential observational signature of both the presence of an axion cloud and axion-photon coupling.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based (BLFQ) and Lagrangian-based (DSE) methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts a heavy axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\sim$ 5 MeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model including a simplified meson fluctuation contribution. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history. The new QCD cosmological scenario potentially predicts rich epochs around the QCD scale: a mini-inflation; a nonperturbative preheating and/or reheating, which can provide characteristic gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition at the level of the mean field approximation in view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off the medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full system, the RLE coincides with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that approximate U(1)_L and discrete Z_2 symmetries may give rise to tiny masses of the left--handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.</description>

      <title>Emission of pairs of Minkowski photons through the lens of the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect.</description>

      <title>The thermal view of $f(R)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof) are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence -- the Euler ensemble -- which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions -- effects not captured by standard phenomenology -- for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points to the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of analytic Hodge-dual matrix surface that solves the Yang-Mills fixed-point loop equation by harmonic map, opening the way for a geometric formulation of QCD string theory.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, within a background history consisting of an initial kinetically dominated phase followed by an ultra-slow-roll inflationary regime, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 88 Sound Horizon Free $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound--Horizon--Free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. Our analysis reveals that the 30 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.73 \pm 0.39$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.72$), while the 58 Distance Ladder-Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 69.37 \pm 0.34$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.95$), a $6.5\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at a minimum value of $3.9\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among categories, Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.61\pm 0.96$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 71.03 \pm 0.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 69.07 \pm 0.44$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.9\sigma$ internal tension among Distance Ladder Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values compared to cosmological-model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM or both.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^5 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</description>

      <title>Geometry is Wavy: Curvature Wave Equations for Generic Affine Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometry is wavy: even at the purely geometric level (no particular theory chosen), curvature satisfies a covariant quasilinear wave equation. In Riemannian geometry equipped with the Levi-Civita connection, the Riemann curvature tensor obeys a wave equation of the schematic form \[ \Box Riem=\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem), \] where $\mathcal{Q}(Riem,Riem)$ denotes the terms quadratic in the curvature arising from the Bianchi identities. In this work, we generalize this curvature wave equation to spacetimes endowed with a generic affine connection possessing torsion and nonmetricity. Working within the metric-affine framework, we derive the corresponding wave equation for the Riemann tensor and analyze its structure in several geometrically and physically distinguished settings, including Einstein spaces, teleparallel gravity, and Einstein-Cartan theory.</description>

      <title>Stimulated radiation from superradiant scalar cloud in scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a defining signature and resource of quantum theory, but its standard definition presupposes a globally fixed decomposition into subsystems. We develop a geometric framework that detects when such a decomposition cannot be globalized for twisted families of pure-state spaces. Using Severi--Brauer schemes associated to Azumaya algebras over a base scheme, we study pure-state entanglement in families of projective state spaces that are locally trivial but globally twisted. For a given factorization type, we show that the existence of a global locus of product states is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying projective linear torsor to the stabilizer of the corresponding Segre variety, so entanglement in families becomes a geometric obstruction to globalizing subsystem structure.
  We construct the moduli space of subsystem structures, identify it with a natural torsor quotient, and realize it as a locally closed locus in the relative Hilbert scheme, yielding a canonical compactification by degenerations of product-state loci. In the bipartite case, once a subsystem structure is chosen, the Schmidt-rank stratification globalizes to a flat filtration with base-change compatible incidence resolutions and fiberwise constant numerical invariants. We complement this with Brauer-theoretic constraints and explicit examples showing that reducibility can depend on the underlying torsor rather than only on the Brauer class, with an interpretation via entangling monodromy.</description>
