      <title>Semi-Implicit Approaches for Large-Scale Bayesian Spatial Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial statistics often rely on Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture dependencies across locations. However, their computational cost increases rapidly with the number of locations, potentially needing multiple hours even for moderate sample sizes. To address this, we propose using Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI), a highly flexible Bayesian approximation method, for scalable Bayesian spatial interpolation. We evaluated SIVI with a GP prior and a Nearest-Neighbour Gaussian Process (NNGP) prior compared to Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI), Pathfinder, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), the reference method in spatial statistics. Methods were compared based on their predictive ability measured by the CRPS, the interval score, and the negative log-predictive density across 50 replicates for both Gaussian and Poisson outcomes. SIVI-based methods achieved similar results to HMC, while being drastically faster. On average, for the Poisson scenario with 500 training locations, SIVI reduced the computational time from roughly 6 hours for HMC to 130 seconds. Furthermore, SIVI-NNGP analyzed a simulated land surface temperature dataset of 150,000 locations while estimating all unknown model parameters in under two minutes. These results highlight the potential of SIVI as a flexible and scalable inference technique in spatial statistics.</description>

      <title>Efficient scenario analysis in real-time Bayesian election forecasting via sequential meta-posterior sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian aggregation lets election forecasters combine diverse sources of information, such as state polls and economic and political indicators: as in our collaboration with The Economist magazine. However, the demands of real-time posterior updating, model checking, and communication introduce practical methodological challenges. In particular, sensitivity and scenario analysis help trace forecast shifts to model assumptions and understand model behavior. Yet, under standard Markov chain Monte Carlo, even small tweaks to the model (e.g., in priors, data, hyperparameters) require full refitting, making such real-time analysis computationally expensive. To overcome the bottleneck, we introduce a meta-modeling strategy paired with a sequential sampling scheme; by traversing posterior meta-models, we enable real-time inference and structured scenario and sensitivity analysis without repeated refitting. In a back-test of the model, we show substantial computational gains and uncover non-trivial sensitivity patterns. For example, forecasts remain responsive to prior confidence in fundamentals-based forecasts, but less so to random walk scale; these help clarify the relative influence of polling data versus structural assumptions.

      <title>Fast sampling and model selection for Bayesian mixture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Bayesian estimation of mixture models and argue in favor of fitting the marginal posterior distribution over component assignments directly, rather than Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior on components and parameters as is commonly done. Some previous authors have found the former approach to have slow mixing, but we show that, implemented correctly, it can achieve excellent performance. In particular, we describe a new Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the marginal posterior of a general integrable mixture that makes use of rejection-free sampling from the prior over component assignments to achieve excellent mixing times in typical applications, outperforming standard Gibbs sampling, in some cases by a wide margin. We demonstrate the approach with a selection of applications to Gaussian, Poisson, and categorical models.</description>
