      <title>Kinematics Calibration and Excitation Energy Reconstruction for Solenoidal Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solenoidal spectrometers are gaining popularity worldwide due to their large acceptance and superior Q-value resolution in reactions involving radioactive beams. This work introduces a novel recoil energy calibration method leveraging known excited states. Building on this calibration, we describe an algorithm that transforms energy-position data into excitation energy and center-of-mass. This approach has been integrated into the HELIOS online analysis routines, enabling the real-time and speedy generation of excitation energy spectra and angular distributions during experiments.</description>

      <title>New Facilities for the Production of 1 mm gap Resistive Plate Chambers for the Upgrade of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer is undergoing a major upgrade for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), including the addition of three new thin-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) layers in the inner barrel region. These RPCs have 1 mm gas gaps between high-pressure phenolic laminate (HPL) electrodes, enhancing their background rate capability and longevity. Nearly 1000 RPC gas gaps will be produced to maximize muon trigger acceptance and efficiency. To reduce reliance on a single supplier and expedite production, the ATLAS muon community formed partnerships with two companies in Germany and the Max Planck Institute for Physics. The gas gap assembly procedure was adapted to the industrial partners' infrastructure and tools, enabling the transfer of technology after prototyping. Manufacturer certification involved constructing multiple small- and full-size gas gap prototypes at each facility. These prototypes underwent extensive testing at CERN's Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++), where their efficiency and time resolution were verified under varying gamma backgrounds. They also passed an accelerated aging test, having been exposed to the maximum photon dose anticipated at the HL-LHC. This contribution presents the gas gap production procedures, certification test results, and a comparison of the manufacturing methods adopted by the different external companies. These outcomes confirm that the new facilities can reliably produce high-quality RPCs meeting ATLAS standards for HL-LHC operations.</description>

      <title>Non-Destructive Argon Concentration Assessment within Insulating Glass Units (IGUs) using Ultrasonic Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insulating glass units (IGUs) contribute significantly to energy loss among building envelopes, as they are responsible for approximately 30 to 50% of thermal transmission losses. To mitigate these losses, inert gases such as Argon are used within IGU spacers. The aging of IGUs cause decrease in Argon gas concentration, affecting their insulating properties. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the Argon concentration to maintain the insulating effectiveness of IGUs. Therefore, this study focuses on utilizing ultrasonic testing (UT) to develop a non-destructive and affordable methodology for assessing argon concentration within IGUs. The methodology is developed in four steps: (1) designing an experimental setup for creating accurate gas mixtures of Argon and air, and transferring the target gas mixtures to the IGU spacer; (2) performing ultrasonic tests on IGUs with 60kHz excitation frequency to generate UT waveforms; (3) performing a validation test of the proposed methodology to verify the accuracy and repeatability of results obtained from step 2; and (4) analyzing the ultrasonic waveforms to explore the correlation between UT properties and Argon concentration within IGU. The findings show that ultrasonic energy serves as the most effective UT feature for assessing Argon concentration within the IGU spacer, as evidenced by a strong correlation with an R-squared value exceeding 0.9 across all the UT measurements. This research introduces a user-friendly solution that enhances the ease of assessing Argon concentration within IGUs' spacers, thereby facilitating the monitoring of their operational performance. The proposed methodology for evaluating Argon concentration holds potential benefits for IGU manufacturers and researchers. Moreover, it serves as a valuable tool for improving quality control across the manufacturing, maintenance, and operational stages of IGUs.</description>

      <title>Intelligent experiments through real-time AI: Fast Data Processing and Autonomous Detector Control for sPHENIX and future EIC detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This R\&amp;D project, initiated by the DOE Nuclear Physics AI-Machine Learning initiative in 2022, leverages AI to address data processing challenges in high-energy nuclear experiments (RHIC, LHC, and future EIC). Our focus is on developing a demonstrator for real-time processing of high-rate data streams from sPHENIX experiment tracking detectors. The limitations of a 15 kHz maximum trigger rate imposed by the calorimeters can be negated by intelligent use of streaming technology in the tracking system. The approach efficiently identifies low momentum rare heavy flavor events in high-rate p+p collisions (3MHz), using Graph Neural Network (GNN) and High Level Synthesis for Machine Learning (hls4ml). Success at sPHENIX promises immediate benefits, minimizing resources and accelerating the heavy-flavor measurements. The approach is transferable to other fields. For the EIC, we develop a DIS-electron tagger using Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning (AI-ML) algorithms for real-time identification, showcasing the transformative potential of AI and FPGA technologies in high-energy nuclear and particle experiments real-time data processing pipelines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones are widespread objects that have been used as physics sensors for the general public thanks to their availability, high connectivity and built-in sensors. Here, we present the use of a fleet of smartphones to create a distributed network of time-synchronized sensors. We first evaluate the sensors quality in the laboratory and then describe the network configuration that allows the remote control of an entire fleet. Finally, we present two test cases that use the smartphone fleet for physical field measurements. By this study, we show that this approach paves the way for large-scale field scientific studies.</description>

      <title>PICOSEC Micromegas Precise-timing Detectors: Development towards Large-Area and Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) is a precise timing gaseous detector based on a Cherenkov radiator coupled with a semi-transparent photocathode and an MM amplifying structure. The detector conceprt was successfully demonstrated through a single-channel prototype, achieving sub-25 ps time resolution with Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs). A series of studies followed, aimed at developing robust, large-area, and scalable detectors with high time resolution, complemented by specialized fast-response readout electronics. This work presents recent advancements towards large-area resistive PICOSEC MM, including 10 $\times$ 10 $\text{cm}^2$ area prototypes and a 20 $\times$ 20 $\text{cm}^2$ prototype, which features the jointing of four photocathodes. The time resolution of these detector prototypes was tested during the test beam, achieved a timing performance of around 25 ps for individual pads in MIPs. Meanwhile, customized electronics have been developed dedicated to the high-precision time measurement of the large-area PICOSEC MM. The performance of the entire system was evaluated during the test beam, demonstrating its capability for large-area integration. These advancements highlight the potential of PICOSEC MM to meet the stringent requirements of future particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Development of the high-rate capable DLC-RPC based on the current evacuation pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency of above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with the current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of the single-gap for $\beta$-ray from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum undetected optical projection tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is an emerging technique that decouples the processes of illuminating an object and projecting its image. The properties of the illuminating and detected light can thus be simultaneously optimised for both contrast on a sample and sensitivity on a camera. Here, we combine QIUP with computed tomography to enable three-dimensional (3D) infrared imaging. The image data is registered with a standard silicon camera at a wavelength of 810 nm, but the extracted 3D images map the sample's absorption at a wavelength of 1550 nm, well beyond the camera's sensitivity. Quantum Undetected Optical Projection Tomography (QUOPT) enables label-free volumetric sensing at difficult to detect wavelengths, such as those that allow molecular imaging contrast, or those within the infrared biological transmission windows.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Bayesian Likelihood Normalisation for CRESST's Background Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using CaWO$_4$ crystals as cryogenic calorimeters, the CRESST experiment searches for nuclear recoils caused by the scattering of potential Dark Matter particles. A reliable identification of a potential signal crucially depends on an accurate background model. In this work we introduce an improved normalisation method for CRESST's model of the electromagnetic backgrounds. Spectral templates, based on Geant4 simulations, are normalised via a Bayesian likelihood fit to experimental background data. Contrary to our previous work, no assumption of partial secular equilibrium is required, which results in a more robust and versatile applicability. Furthermore, considering the correlation between all background components allows us to explain 82.7% of the experimental background within [1 keV, 40 keV], an improvement of 18.6% compared to our previous method.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Optimization of a Cryogenic Pure CsI Detector with Remarkable Light Yield and Unprecedented Energy Resolution for CLOVERS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05026v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we comprehensively characterized and optimized a cryogenic pure CsI (pCsI) detector. We utilized a {$\SI{2}{cm}\times\SI{2}{cm}\times\SI{2}{cm}$} cube crystal coupled with a HAMAMATSU R11065 photomultiplier tube, achieving a remarkable light yield of \SI{35.2}{PE/\keV_{ee}} and an unprecedented energy resolution of \SI{6.9}{\%} at {\SI{59.54}{\keV}}. Additionally, we measured the scintillation decay time of pCsI, which was significantly shorter than that of CsI(Na) at room temperature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of temperature, surface treatment, and crystal shape on light yield. Notably, the light yield peaked at approximately \SI{20}{\K} and remained stable within the range of \SI{70}--\SI{100}{\K}. The light yield of the polished crystals was approximately 1.5 times greater than that of the ground crystals, whereas the crystal shape exhibited minimal influence on the light yield. These results are crucial for the design of the \SI{10}{\kg} pCsI detector for the future CLOVERS (Coherent eLastic neutrinO(V)-nucleus scattERing at China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS)) experiment.`</description>

      <title>Uncooled Thermal Infrared Detection Near the Fundamental Limit Using a Nanomechanical Resonator with a Broadband Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a thermal infrared detector utilizing a nano-optomechanical silicon nitride (SiN) resonator, equipped with a free-space impedance-matched (FSIM) absorber composed of a platinum (Pt) thin film, offering a broadband spectral absorptance on average of 47%. To reduce photothermal back-action caused by intensity fluctuations of the readout laser, the FSIM absorber incorporates a circular clearance for the laser. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of the thermal time constant, power responsivity, and frequency stability of the resonators, with experimental results compared to analytical models and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The fastest thermal response is observed for the smallest 1 mm resonators, with a thermal time constant tau_th = 14 ms. The noise equivalent power (NEP) of the resonators is assessed, showing that the smallest 1 mm resonators exhibit the best sensitivity, with NEP = 27 pW/sqrt(Hz) and a respective specific detectivity of D* = 3.8e9 cm sqrt(Hz)/W. This is less than three times below the theoretical maximum for an ideal IR detector with 50% absorptance. This places our resonators among the most sensitive room-temperature IR detectors reported to date offering an extended spectral range from the near-IR to far-IR. This work underscores the potential of nano-optomechanical resonators for high-performance IR sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an energy resolution study of the JUNO experiment, incorporating the latest knowledge acquired during the detector construction phase. The determination of neutrino mass ordering in JUNO requires an exceptional energy resolution better than 3\% at 1~MeV. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant efforts have been undertaken in the design and production of the key components of the JUNO detector. Various factors affecting the detection of inverse beta decay signals have an impact on the energy resolution, extending beyond the statistical fluctuations of the detected number of photons, such as the properties of the liquid scintillator, performance of photomultiplier tubes, and the energy reconstruction algorithm. To account for these effects, a full JUNO simulation and reconstruction approach is employed. This enables the modeling of all relevant effects and the evaluation of associated inputs to accurately estimate the energy resolution. The results of study reveal an energy resolution of 2.95\% at 1~MeV. Furthermore, this study assesses the contribution of major effects to the overall energy resolution budget. This analysis serves as a reference for interpreting future measurements of energy resolution during JUNO data collection. Moreover, it provides a guideline for comprehending the energy resolution characteristics of liquid scintillator-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>
