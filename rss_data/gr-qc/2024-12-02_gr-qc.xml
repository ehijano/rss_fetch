      <title>Black hole thermodynamics in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of general relativity is often considered under the framework of modified Einstein gravity to explain different phenomena under strong curvature. The strong curvature effect plays a main role near black holes, where the gravitational field is strongest. The idea of black hole thermodynamics is to describe the strong field curvature properties of a black hole in the effective thermodynamical framework, e.g. entropy, temperature, heat capacity etc. In this paper, our aim is to explore how the effect of modified gravity changes the thermodynamic properties of black hole. We show that even a small modification to Einstein gravity affects the thermodynamical properties of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dissipative Forces in Celestial Motion Using the Method of Multiple Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of nonlinear dissipative forces, specifically Gravitational Friction (GF), on the precession of celestial bodies within the framework of general relativity. We derive a modified line element by introducing a density-dependent term to model interactions between planetary bodies and the low-density interplanetary medium, providing a covariant description of dissipative forces in planetary motion. The resulting metric modification leads to corrections in the perihelion precession of Mercury, also reproducing the classical relativistic predictions. Utilizing the method of multiple scales, we analyze perturbative effects induced by GF. Using this model, we successfully constrain the medium density near Mercury to approximately $\rho_0 \approx 1.12 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{kg/m}^3$. These findings offer a new approach for incorporating dissipative mechanisms into general relativity, with potential applications in other astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from Kiselev anisotropic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a generalization of Kiselev black holes by introducing a varying equation of state parameter for the anisotropic fluid surrounding the black hole. We extend this model by allowing $w$ in the expression $p_t(r)/\rho(r) = (3w + 1)/2$ to vary as a function of the radial coordinate, and derive new solutions to the Einstein field equations for this configuration. In particular, we study solutions that describe regular black holes. By choosing specific forms of $w(r)$, we obtain regular black hole solutions, and show that the matter surrounding the black hole can satisfy the weak and strong energy conditions under certain values of parameters analyzed. Due to the generality of this treatment, other categories of black holes can be obtained with particular choices of the parameter of equation of state. Our analysis confirms that the curvature invariants associated with the regular black holes remain finite at the origin, indicating the absence of singularities. We also explore the physical properties of the matter associated with these solutions. Due to the versatility, we suggest the possibility of using this approach as a tool to construct new physical solutions associated with regular black holes or other geometries of interest.</description>

      <title>Deformed algebraic structure of angular momenta: GUP perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of a minimal length scale by various quantum gravity candidates (such as string/M theory, Doubly Special Relativity, Loop Quantum Gravity and others) have suggested modification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), resulting in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP).
  In this short review, we investigate the origins of the GUP and examine higher-order models, focusing on the linear plus quadratic form of the GUP. We extend the concept of minimal length to minimal angular resolution, which plays a crucial role in modifying angular momentum and its associated algebra. A comparison is made between the standard angular momentum commutator algebra and that modified by the GUP. Finally, we review its application in the hydrogen atom spectra and and discuss future endeavors.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Energy Properties with Barrow Holographic Model in f(Q, C) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe remains one of the foremost challenges in modern cosmology. This study investigates Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE), a model inspired by quantum gravitational corrections, within the framework of \(f(Q,C)\) gravity. This extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity incorporates the non-metricity scalar \(Q\) and the boundary term \(C\), enabling a deeper exploration of cosmic dynamics without relying on a cosmological constant or exotic matter. The BHDE model is analyzed under a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, focusing on key cosmological parameters such as energy density, isotropic pressure, the equation of state (EoS) parameter, stability conditions and the energy conditions. The results demonstrate that the EoS parameter transitions from matter-like behavior (\(z &gt; 0\)) to negative values at \(z = 0\), indicating the dominance of dark energy and its role in the universe's accelerated expansion. As \(z\) approaches \(-1\), the EoS parameter asymptotically converges to \(-1\), aligning with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. This work underscores the potential of the BHDE model in \(f(Q,C)\) gravity as a comprehensive framework for studying cosmic acceleration. By incorporating Barrow entropy and addressing the interplay between non-metricity and boundary terms, the model provides a dynamic approach to explaining dark energy.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of gravitational lensing by Hu-Sawicki $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, gravitational lensing in the weak and strong field limits is investigated for black hole spacetime within the framework of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity. We employ the Ishihara et al. approach for weak lensing and adopt Bozza's method for strong lensing to explore the impact of Hu-Sawicki model parameters on lensing phenomenon. The deflection angles are computed and analyzed in both the field limits. Our investigation in the weak as well as the strong lensing reveals that in the case of Hu-Sawicki black holes, photons exhibit divergence at smaller impact parameters for different values of the model parameters compared to the Schwarzschild scenario and the photon experiences negative deflection angle when impact parameter moves towards the larger impact parameter values. Additionally, by calculating strong lensing coefficients we study their behavior with model parameters. The strong lensing key observables associated with the lensing effect viz. the angular position $\vartheta_{\infty}$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_\text{mag}$ are estimated numerically by extending the analysis to supermassive black holes $\text{SgrA}^*$ and $\text{M87}^*$ and analyzed their behavior concerning the parameters for each black hole. The analysis shows that $\text{SgrA}^*$ demonstrates larger values of $\vartheta_{\infty}$ and $s$ relative to $\text{M87}^*$.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of spontaneous scalarized Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies reveal that Kerr black holes can undergo spontaneous scalarization via an appropriate coupling between a scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet term. This mechanism introduces observable signatures in the quasinormal mode spectrum, which characterizes the ringdown phase of gravitational waves. In this work, we present, for the first time, the quasinormal modes of rotating scalarized black holes within the framework of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, without resorting to perturbative expansion of either the coupling constant or the black hole spin. Using spectral decomposition, we numerically construct both the background solution and the perturbation functions, reformulating the calculation of quasinormal modes as a generalized eigenvalue problem. Our results pave the way for advanced ringdown tests of spontaneous scalarization using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Faster rate of Hawking radiation in modified gravity constraining dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact theory of gravity in the strong field regime is still under debate. There are observations implying the need for modification to Einstein's gravity. On the other hand, the exact constituents of dark matter are also a big puzzle, where primordial black holes (PBHs) are argued to be a potential candidate. We explore Hawking radiation in a modified gravity and find that PBHs evaporate faster in a scalar-tensor theory based modified gravity. Subsequently, all the nonrotating BHs of mass $\sim 10^{15}$ g or less should have been evaporated by today, which is an order of magnitude heavier than what the Einstein gravity predicts. This has many consequences including a strict constraint on contributing PBHs to dark matter, widening the debate of dark matter origin.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Can Neutron Star Tidal Effects Obscure Deviations from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of gravitational-wave astrophysics is to study gravity in the strong-field regime and constrain deviations from general relativity. Any such deviation affects not only binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission but also the structure and tidal properties of compact objects. In the case of neutron stars, masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities can all differ significantly between different theories of gravity. Currently, the measurement uncertainties in neutron-star radii and tidal deformabilities are quite large. However, much less is known about how the large uncertainty in the nuclear equation of state might affect tests of general relativity using binary neutron-star mergers. Conversely, using the wrong theory of gravity might lead to incorrect constraints on the nuclear equation of state. Here we study this problem within scalar-tensor theory. We apply the recently derived $\ell = 2$ tidal love numbers in this theory to parameter estimation of GW170817. Correspondingly, we test if physics beyond general relativity could bias measurements of the nuclear equation of state and neutron-star radii. We find that parameter inference for both the general relativistic and scalar-tensor case return consistent component masses and tidal deformabilites. The radius and the equation of state posteriors, however, differ between the two theories, but neither is excluded by current observational limits. This indicates that measurements of the nuclear equation of state may be biased and that deviations from general relativity could go undetected when analyzing current binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate head-on collisions of $\ell$-boson stars, potential candidates for dark matter compact objects. We begin with a review of the general properties and features of these stars, leveraging results from prior studies to analyze the gravitational wave signals generated by such collisions. Considering a maximum distance of 100 Mpc for potential events, we identify the range of masses and scalar field frequencies for these stars that would render the gravitational waves detectable by current gravitational wave observatories. Additionally, we process the resulting signals to generate simulated observatory images, highlighting their similarities and differences compared to those produced by black hole collisions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Relativistic Temperature in Self-Gravitating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature is a key physical observable at the foundation of both fundamental research and technological applications. However, defining temperature within a relativistic framework remains challenging due to the difficulty of testing thermodynamic laws in this context and the technical complexity of formulating a kinetic theory consistent with Einstein's field equations. Consequently, the transformation law of temperature between inertial frames also remains unresolved. In this study, we introduce a kinetic definition of temperature for an ensemble of self-gravitating particles, assuming that temperature reflects the average spatial kinetic energy of a particle. This kinetic temperature, which applies outside of equilibrium, naturally reduces to the familiar special relativistic and non-relativistic temperatures in appropriate limits. Moreover, it exhibits the Tolman-Ehrenfest effect, linking temperature to the norm of the Killing field associated with coordinate time. We further demonstrate that, when particle speeds are non-relativistic, the transformation law for kinetic temperature follows the Ott-Arzeli\`es formula, suggesting that in this regime, a moving body appears hotter. However, when particle speeds are relativistic, the transformation of kinetic temperature depends on both the relative speed of the frames and the particle distribution.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Quantum Time in the $U(1)^3$ Model of Euclidean Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop Quantum Gravity faces challenges in constructing a well-defined Hamiltonian constraint and understanding the quantum notion of time. In this paper these issues are studied by quantizing the $U(1)^3$ model, a simplified system exhibiting features similar to general relativity. By isolating a holonomy component within the Hamiltonian constraint, a discrete relative time evolution equation for quantum states is obtained. Then a Shr\"{o}dinger-like equation is derived in continuous limit. Thus the physical states solving this Shr\"{o}dinger-like equation can be written out. The emergence of the time parameter and its corresponding quantum operator are analyzed. It indicates the notion of a geometrical quantum time for quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust, unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in physics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Properties and Constitution of Compact Objects in Gravitational-Wave Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations point toward strong evidence for the existence of black holes (BHs). Nevertheless, it is yet to be established or ruled out with confidence whether some exotic compact objects (ECOs), capable of mimicking black holes from an observational point of view, are indeed doing so. In classical General Relativity (GR), a horizon is the defining feature of a black hole, which prevents any event inside from causally affecting the outside Universe. The quest for distinguishing black holes from horizonless compact objects using gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) can be helped by utilizing the phenomenon of tidal heating (TH), which leaves its imprint on the binary waveforms through the horizon parameters. First, we study the measurabilities of these parameters within the inspiral regime. Then, to extend our investigation for heavier binaries, we construct an inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform by using post-Newtonian calculations for the inspiral and numerical relativity data for the merger-ringdown part that incorporates the effects of tidal heating of black holes in the phase and the amplitude. The new model shows improvements in waveform accuracy when compared to numerical relativity data. In the late inspiral phase when the compact objects are closer to each other, the effects of tidal heating are stronger, opening up the possibility of identifying the objects more precisely. We demonstrate, from numerical relativity data of binary black holes, how one can model tidal heating in the late inspiral regime and leverage this knowledge to test for horizonless compact objects mimicking black holes. These studies bear significance in determining the nature of compact objects having masses in the entire range that LIGO and future ground-based gravitational-wave detectors can detect.</description>

      <title>The First Law and Weak Cosmic Censorship for de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Iyer-Wald's covariant phase space formalism to asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes and establish the thermodynamic first law, expressed in terms of the Abbott-Deser mass. Similar to Iyer-Wald's first law for asymptotically flat black holes, our first law applies to general asymptotically de Sitter perturbations around a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole, without imposing any symmetry for the perturbations. We explicitly derive the first law up to the second order in perturbation. Additionally, we apply this first law to a thought experiment involving the overcharging of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter black hole by injecting energy and charge sources. We find that asymptotically de Sitter black holes cannot be overcharged, provided that the null energy condition holds, thereby reinforcing the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Confluent Heun functions in Black Hole Perturbation Theory: a spacetime interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a geometrical interpretation of the confluent Heun functions (CHE) within black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) and elaborates on their relation to the hyperboloidal framework. In BHPT, the confluent Heun functions are solutions to the radial Teukolsky equation, but they are traditionally studied without an explicit reference to the underlying spacetime geometry. Here, we show that the distinct behaviour of confluent Heun functions near their singular points reflects the structure of key geometrical surfaces in black hole spacetimes. By interpreting homotopic transformations of the confluent Heun functions as changes in the spacetime foliation, we connect these solutions to different regions of the black hole's global structure, such as the past and future event horizons, past and future null infinity, spatial infinity, and even past and future time infinity. We also discuss the relation between CHEs and the hyperboloidal formulation of the Teukolsky equation. Even though neither representation of the radial Teukolsky equation in the confluent Heun form can be interpreted as hyperboloidal slices, this geometrical approach offers new insights into wave propagation and scattering from a global black hole spacetime perspective.</description>

      <title>Applicability of multi-component study on Bayesian searches for targeted anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic background gravitational waves have not yet been detected by ground-based laser interferometric detectors, but recent improvements in detector sensitivity have raised considerable expectations for their eventual detection. Previous studies have introduced methods for exploring anisotropic background gravitational waves using Bayesian statistics. These studies represent a groundbreaking approach by offering physically motivated anisotropy mapping that is distinct from the Singular Value Decomposition regularization of the Fisher Information Matrix. However, they are limited by the use of a single model, which can introduce potential bias when dealing with complex data that may consist of a mixture of multiple models. Here, we demonstrate the bias introduced by a single-component model approach in the parametric interpretation of anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds, and we confirm that using multiple-component models can mitigate this bias.</description>

      <title>Counterintuitive properties of relativistic relative motion for accelerated observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in teaching about special relativity is that a number of the theory's effects are at odds with the intuition of classical physics, as well as student's everyday experience. The relativity of simultaneity, time dilation and length contraction are prominent examples. This article describes two additional, less well-known counter-intuitive properties, both of which follow from the relativistic definition of relative motion, in situations with accelerated observers: (a) when two objects have a constant radar distance and are by that standard ``at relative rest,'' their relative speed is not necessarily zero, and (b) for two observers A and B, a situation is possible where A considers the two to be approaching each other, while B considers them to be moving away from each other. In general relativity, the generalisations of these two properties prove helpful for understanding static gravitational fields, and they also provide some insight into the nature of horizons.</description>

      <title>To the Problem of Cosmic Expansion in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider evolving, spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous (FLRW) cosmologies in ghost-free (dRGT) massive gravity. In this theory, no dynamical flat FLRW background exists if the reference metric is chosen to be Minkowski and the Stueckelberg fields are homogeneous. Relaxing the assumptions on the Stueckelberg profiles gives access to dynamical backgrounds. We propose a classification of the viable flat FLRW cosmological solutions of dRGT massive gravity. Instead of specifying an initial ansatz for the Stueckelberg fields $\phi^a$ and the reference metric $f_{ab}$, we show that imposing homogeneity and isotropy on the square root tensor $X^{\mu}_{\nu}=\left(\sqrt{g^{-1}\partial\phi^a \partial\phi^bf_{ab}}\right)^{\mu}_{\nu}$ leads to dynamical cosmological solutions, and we characterize their properties. These solutions become dynamical only when the Stueckelberg fields acquire a sufficiently inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic profile. We explore the consequences for the minimal model and the complete dRGT theory, and show that perturbations are strongly coupled, at the quadratic level, on these backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The scalar angular Teukolsky equation and its solution for the Taub-NUT spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taub-NUT spacetime offers many curious insights into the solutions of Einstein's electrovacuum equation. In the Bonnor interpretation, this spacetime possesses so-called Misner strings, which induce phenomena strikingly analogous to Dirac strings in the context of magnetic monopoles. The study of scattering in the latter case leads to a quantization of the product of electric charge and magnetic moment, sometimes called the Dirac condition. To enable a thorough discussion of scattering on the Taub-NUT spacetime, linear perturbations are considered in the Newman-Penrose formalism and separated into angular and radial equations. The angular Teukolsky equation is discussed in detail, and eigenvalues are derived to subsequently solve the differential equation in terms of solutions to the confluent Heun equation. In the Bonnor interpretation of the Taub-NUT spacetime, there is no analog property to the Dirac condition. The choice of spacetime parameters remains unconstrained. However, for a particular parameter choice, one can rederive the well-known "Misner" condition, in which a product of frequency and NUT charge is of integer value, as well as another product additionally including the Manko-Ruiz parameter. The results of this work will allow us to solve analytically for wave-optical scattering in order to, e.g., examine the wave-optical image of Taub-NUT black holes.</description>

      <title>RPST-Inspired Formalism for Black Holes in Flat Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel formalism for the thermodynamics of flat black holes, inspired by the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) framework. Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the thermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\'enyi entropy framework and that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The RPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is linked to the central charge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black holes, where $\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter $\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism incorporates $\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential $\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central charge $C$ and chemical potential $\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the applicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Increasing quantum speed limit via non-uniform magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) defines the theoretical upper bound on how fast a quantum system can evolve between states. It imposes a fundamental constraint on the rate of quantum information processing. For a relativistic spin-up electron in a uniform magnetic field, QSL increased with the magnetic field strength till around $10^{15}$ Gauss, before saturating at a saturated QSL (SQSL) of 0.2407c, where c is the speed of light. We show that by using variable magnetic fields, it is possible to surpass this limit, achieving SQSL upto 0.4-0.6c. To attain this quantum phenomenon, we solve the evolution equation of relativistic electron in spatially varying magnetic fields and find that the energies of various electron states become non-degenerate as opposed to the constant magnetic field case. This redistribution of energy is the key ingredient to accomplish higher QSL and, thus, a high information processing speed. We further explore how QSL can serve as a bridge between relativistic and non-relativistic quantum dynamics, providing insights via the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound, a quantity which constrains the maximal rate of information production. We also propose a practical experimental setup to realize these advancements. These results hold immense potential for propelling fields of quantum computation, thermodynamics and metrology.</description>

      <title>Wheeler-De Witt equation and the Canonical Construction of the Glauber-Sudarshan States in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is fundamentally different from the non-gravitational quantum field theories in the sense that most of the techniques derived for the latter cannot be easily extended to the former. For example, correlation functions in quantum gravity become hard to define properly if the bulk Hamiltonian - as a consequence of the Wheeler-De Witt equation - itself annihilates the states thus rendering the evolution operators to identities. An even harder problem is the back reactions of the fluctuations on the background itself. We argue that the construction of the Glauber-Sudarshan states takes care of these two issues in rather interesting ways. For the former, the displacement operators are defined at every instant of time, without directly invoking the Hamiltonian, so that they naturally extend to the path-integral description as sum over histories. For the latter, the back reactions of the fluctuations are carefully accounted for by the Schwinger-Dyson equations. In fact these back reactions are in part responsible for converting the ambient supersymmetric Minkowski background to a transient de Sitter phase. Expectedly, this transient de Sitter phase is defined well within the validity regime of the trans-Planckian bound.</description>

      <title>Charged Rotating Hairy Black Holes in AdS$_5 \times S^5$: Unveiling their Secrets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a mix of analytical and numerical methods, we construct new rotating, charged "hairy" black hole solutions of $D=5$, ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity that are dual, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, to thermal states in $D=4$, ${\cal N}=4$ SYM at finite chemical and angular potential, thereby complementing and extending the results of [arXiv:1005.1287, arXiv:1806.01849, arXiv:1809.04084]. These solutions uplift to asymptotically AdS$_5 \times S^5$ solutions of Type IIB supergravity with equal angular momenta along AdS$_5$ ($J=J_1=J_2$) and $S^5$ ($Q=Q_1=Q_2=Q_3$). As we lower the mass $E$ at fixed $Q$ and $J$, the known Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope (CLP) black holes are unstable to scalar condensation and the hairy black holes constructed here emerge as novel solutions associated to the instability. In the region of phase space where the CLP and hairy black holes coexist, the hairy black holes dominate the microcanonical ensemble and, therefore, describe a new thermodynamic phase of SYM. The hairy black holes extend beyond the CLP extremality surface all the way to the BPS surface, defined by $E = 3 Q + 2 J / L$. Through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we argue that the BPS limit of the hairy black holes is a singular, horizonless solution, and $not$ a new two-parameter family of BPS black holes that extend the known one-parameter Gutowski-Reall (GR) black hole solution, in contradiction with the conjectures of [arXiv:1005.1287, arXiv:1806.01849]. To further support our conclusions, we perform a near-horizon analysis of the BPS equations and argue that they do not admit any regular solutions with an horizon.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Can we detect super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs via continuous gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of massive white dwarfs (WDs) containing more than Chandrasekhar's maximum mass has been suggested via the detection of peculiar type Ia Supernovae. It had been crucial to directly detect those 'super' (more massive)-Chandrasekhar WDs to confirm their existence. The WD's small size and cold internal environment have been a great disadvantage for detecting them via electromagnetic surveys like GAIA and SDSS. Although many WDs are detected in optical observations, none of the super-Chandrasekhar WDs was observed directly. Mukhopadhyay and his group proposed a decade ago that one of the possibilities to explain the high mass of super-Chandrasekhar WD is to exercise the existence of a strong magnetic field in the WD interior. The group also recently proposed that a high magnetic field, in turn, can nontrivially deform the star from a spherical shape. In the presence of rotation and obliquity angle, such WDs can radiate continuous gravitational waves (CGW). This opens up the exciting possibility of detecting the super-Chandrasekhar WDs with the upcoming detector LISA. However, the gravitational wave (GW) amplitude will decay with time due to electromagnetic radiation and quadrupolar radiation. Altogether, those decay mechanisms will set a timescale for detecting WDs via CGW. Even with a timescale bound, we can expect to detect a few super-Chandrasekhar WDs with a couple of years of cumulative detection, leading to the direct detection of super-Chandrasekhar WDs.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of capped black holes: large and small bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new non-BPS solution describing an asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric capped black hole in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This solution describes a spherical black hole, while the exterior region of the horizon exhibits a non-trivial topology of $[{\mathbb R}^4 \# {\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^2] \setminus {\mathbb B}^4$ on a timeslice. This solution extends our previously constructed three-parameter solution to a more general four-parameter solution. To derive this solution, we utilize a combination of the Ehlers and Harrison transformations and then impose appropriate boundary conditions on the solution's parameters. It can be shown that the resultant solution is free from curvature, conical, Dirac-Misner string and orbifold singularities, as well as closed timelike curves on and outside the horizon. Characterized by four independent conserved charges -- mass, two angular momenta, and electric charge -- this solution reveals two distinct branches: a small bubble branch and a large bubble branch, distinguished by non-conserved local quantities such as magnetic flux or magnetic potential. This shows the non-uniqueness for spherical black holes, even among capped black holes. For equivalent sets of conserved charges, we find that the large/small bubble branch can have larger/smaller entropy than the Cveti\v{c}-Youm black hole.</description>

      <title>Revisit the relationship between spread complexity rate and radial momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses the relationship between the boundary spread complexity rate and the radial momentum in the bulk within the framework of AdS/CFT. We demonstrate that the radial momentum of a freely falling particle, as measured by a stationary observer in the bulk, is equal to the spread complexity rate of the boundary conformal field theory. For a massive particle (no matter what the specific mass is), the particle is located at the asymptotic boundary with zero velocity at $t=0$. Additionally, we provide a simple method for obtaining spread complexity from radial momentum using optical geometry.</description>

      <title>Accurate muonic interactions in neutron-star mergers and impact on heavy-element nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundances resulting from $r$-process nucleosynthesis as predicted by simulations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers remain an open question as the current state-of-the-art is still restricted to three-species neutrino transport. We present the first BNS merger simulations employing a moment-based general-relativistic neutrino transport with five neutrino species, thus including (anti)muons and advanced muonic $\beta$-processes, and contrast them with traditional three neutrino-species simulations. Our results show that a muonic trapped-neutrino equilibrium is established, forming a different trapped-neutrino hierarchy akin to the electronic equilibrium. The formation of (anti)muons and the muonization via muonic $\beta$-processes enhance the neutrino luminosity, leading to rapid cooling in the early post-merger phase. Since muonic processes redirect part of the energy otherwise used for protonization by electronic processes, they yield a cooler remnant and disk, together with neutrino-driven winds that are more neutron-rich. Importantly, the unbound ejected mass is smaller than three-species simulations and, because of its comparatively smaller temperature and proton fraction, it can enhance lanthanide production and reduce the overproduction of light $r$-process elements for softer equations of state. This finding underlines the importance of muonic interactions and five neutrino species in long-lived BNS remnants.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric reconstructions of cosmic curvature: current constraints and forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumption of a flat universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been seldom tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, such as those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves in light of Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Complex Powerballs: Conformal Cores of Quantum Black Holes in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that quadratic gravity, as a renormalizable theory, describes the interior of quantum black holes. We find new exact power-law solutions to pure quadratic gravity under spherical symmetry, which are complex valued. The resulting solutions, dubbed powerballs, are horizonless compact objects that become Schwarzschild-like a small distance (of the order of the Planck length) outside the would-be Schwarzschild horizon. We present a description of the global eternal geometry, whose right and left exteriors are Lorentzian and Euclidean Schwarzschild-like regions, respectively, while the complex interior is a form of spiraling spacetime. We compute the total on-shell action integral as a saddle point to a gravitational path integral and discuss the Lorentzian and Euclidean interpretations thereof.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection under centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the physical implications of the centrifugal and gravitational electromotive forces on magnetic reconnection in a Kerr black hole background. We find that both forces increase the reconnection rate, though the underlying mechanisms differ substantially. The gravitational force leads to a separation of charge density, breaking the quasi-neutrality of the plasma. In contrast, the centrifugal electromotive force affects the electric current by reducing the effective length of the current sheet. This reduction arises from the non-Euclidean spatial geometry observed by a locally comoving observer with respect to the rotating sheet. This phenomenon amplifies both the transport of charged carriers and the thermal-inertia effect within the current sheet, irrespective of the presence of a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the anisotropy in the gravitational wave (GW) background originating from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We derive the distribution of the GW anisotropy power spectrum coefficients, $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$, in scenarios including environmental effects and eccentricities of the SMBH binaries. Although the mean of $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$ is the same for all multipoles, we show that their distributions vary, with the low $l$ distributions being the widest. We also find a strong correlation between spectral fluctuations and the anisotropy in the GW signal. We show that the GW anisotropy can break the degeneracy between the scenarios including environmental effects or eccentricity. In particular, we find that existing NANOGrav constraints on GW anisotropy begin to constrain SMBH scenarios with strong environmental effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the natural inflation model comprising a non-Abelian gauge sector coupled to the axion-inflaton kinetic term. We show how such non-minimal coupling serves as a source of friction for the rolling inflaton granting sixty or more $e$-folds of accelerated expansion for sub-Planckian values of the axion decay constant. The analysis of perturbations reveals a negative sound speed, thus signaling an instability. Implementing a Chern-Simons-type coupling between the inflaton and gauge sectors cures the instability by delivering a positive speed. We perform a numerical study of scalar and tensor perturbations for a fiducial set of parameters finding that the corresponding observables are compatible with current CMB bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk cone singularities are singularities in boundary two-point functions at points separated by a null geodesic in the bulk, but not in the boundary. In this work, we describe a new type of bulk cone singularities in a family of Vaidya-like spacetimes that are labeled by the radius $r_+$ of the resulting black hole. We find a sharp transition in the causal structure within this family of spacetimes at $r_+=l$, the AdS length. In particular, there are bulk cone singularities that do not exist in the $r_+&gt;l$ case, but appear for $r_+&lt;l$. In the case of $r_+&lt;l$ where such singularities exist, we are able to reproduce the singularities in a CFT$_2$ calculation using large $c$ conformal blocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially compact spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>Hawking-type singularity theorems for worldvolume energy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical singularity theorems of R. Penrose and S. Hawking from the 1960s show that, given a pointwise energy condition (and some causality as well as initial assumptions), spacetimes cannot be geodesically complete. Despite their great success, the theorems leave room for physically relevant improvements, especially regarding the classical energy conditions as essentially any quantum field theory necessarily violates them. While singularity theorems with weakened energy conditions exist for worldline integral bounds, so called worldvolume bounds are in some cases more applicable than the worldline ones, such as the case of some massive free fields. In this paper we study integral Ricci curvature bounds based on worldvolume quantum strong energy inequalities. Under the additional assumption of a - potentially very negative - global timelike Ricci curvature bound, a Hawking type singularity theorem is proven. Finally, we apply the theorem to a cosmological scenario proving past geodesic incompleteness in cases where the worldline theorem was inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using recently developed consistent and robust first order relativistic hydrodynamics of a dissipative fluid we propose a generalization but weak version of Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law on a general background spacetime. These relations are appeared to be a consequence of thermal equilibrium state of the fluid, defined by the absence of heat flux. We interpret them as the defining relations for the local temperature and chemical potential of the fluid. The validity of usual Tolman-Ehrenfest relation and Klein's law deeply depends on the existence of a global timelike Killing vector. However imposition of more stronger equilibrium condition -- local conservation of entropy current -- yields the constancy of the equilibrium thermodynamic parameters along the flow lines.</description>

      <title>Vector Field Dynamics: Field Equations and Energy Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic field theory for a vector field on a curved space-time is considered assuming that the Lagrangian field density is quadratic and contains field derivatives of first order at most. By applying standard variational calculus, the general Euler-Lagrange equations for the field are derived and the existence of a conserved current is achieved. The field equations are also analyzed from an eikonal-like point of view. The Hilbert energy-momentum tensor of the field is also derived and the influence of each one of the irreducible pieces appearing in the Lagrangian is studied. Particular values of the free parameters allow to retrieve known results.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Exact Arbitrarily Differentiable de Sitter Cores with Kerr Exteriors: Possible gravastar or regular black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the paradigm of non-perturbative Einstein gravity we study continuous curvature manifolds which possess de Sitter interiors and Kerr exteriors. These manifolds could represent the spacetime of rotating gravastars or other similar black hole mimickers. The scheme presented here allows for a $C^{n}$ metric transition from the exactly de Sitter interior to the exactly Kerr exterior, with $n$ arbitrarily large. Generic properties that such models must possess are discussed, such as the changing of the topology of the ergosphere from $S^{2}$ to $S^{1}\times S^{1}$. It is shown how in the outer layers of the transition region (the ``atmosphere'' as it is often called in astrophysics) the dominant/weak and strong energy conditions can be respected. However, much like in the case of its static spherically symmetric gravastar counterpart, there must be some assumptions imposed in the atmosphere for the energy conditions to hold. These assumptions turn out to not be severe. The class of manifolds presented here are expected to possess all the salient features of the fully generic case. Strictly speaking, a number of the results are also applicable to the locally anti-de Sitter core scenario, although we focus on the case of a positive cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Holonomy operator for spin connection and spatial scalar curvature operator in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we propose a new construction of the spatial scalar curvature operator in (1+3)-dimensional LQG based on the twisted geometry. The starting point of the construction is to express the holonomy of the spin connection on a graph in terms of the twisted geometry variables, and we check that this expression reproduces the spin connection in terms of triads in a certain continuum limit. The spatial scalar curvature in terms of twisted geometry is obtained by considering the composition of the holonomy of the spin connection on the loops. With the twisted geometry parametrization of the holonomy-flux phase space, we further express the holonomy of the spin connection and the spatial scalar curvature on a graph in terms of fluxes. Finally, they are promoted as well-defined operators by replacing the fluxes with ordered flux operators.</description>

      <title>Genuine N-partite entanglement in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by $n$ observers near BEH and $m$ ($n+m=N$) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Khronon Theory in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics and Large-Scale Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on a space-time foliation by three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces labeled by the Khronon scalar field $\tau$. We show that this theory (i) leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems; (ii) recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime; (iii) is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies at linear cosmological scales, where the theory reduces to a subset of the generalized dark matter (GDM) model. We compute the second order action on a Minkowski background and show that it contains the usual tensor modes of GR and a scalar degree of freedom with dispersion relation $\omega=0$. We find that the deconstrained Hamiltonian is bounded from below for wavenumbers larger than $\sim 10^{-31}\,\text{eV}$ and unbounded for smaller wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

Abstract: We study the response of a rotating BTZ black hole to the scalar tidal perturbation. We show that the real component of the tidal response function isn't zero, indicating that a rotating BTZ black hole possesses non-zero tidal Love numbers. Additionally, we observe scale-dependent behaviour, known as log-running, in the tidal response function. We also conduct a separate analysis on an extremal rotating BTZ black hole, finding qualitative similarities with its non-extremal counterpart. In addition, we present a procedure to calculate the tidal response function of a charged rotating BTZ black hole as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate the model and extra friction term effects in standard siren (SS) data simulation of modified gravity, we simulated three types of SS data based on different fiducial models which are $\Lambda$CDM, $f(Q)|_{PE}$ and $f(Q)|_{HT}$ models. The current cosmological electromagnetic (EM) observations are combined to get fiducial parameter values for the SS simulations. The comparison between GW\Romannum{1} and GW\Romannum{2} gives out the model effect is small. The comparison between GW\Romannum{2} and GW\Romannum{3} shows the friction term will shift the values of model parameters, especially $\Omega_{m0}$.</description>

      <title>Fast wavelet basis search for generic gravitational wave bursts in Pulsar Timing Array data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we move into an era of more sensitive pulsar timing array data sets, we may be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources from the stochastic gravitational wave background. While some of these sources, like orbiting massive black hole binaries, have well-defined waveform models, there could also be signals present with unknown morphology. This motivates the search for generic gravitational-wave bursts in a signal-agnostic way. However, these searches are computationally prohibitive due to the expansive parameter space. In this paper we present QuickBurst, an algorithm with a re-defined likelihood that lets us expedite Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for a subset of the signal parameters by avoiding repeated calculations of costly inner products. This results in an overall speedup factor of $\sim$200 on realistic simulated datasets, which is sufficient to make generic gravitational-wave burst searches feasible on current and growing pulsar timing array datasets.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03650v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes within the framework of non-commutative geometry. By solving the Einstein's equations, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that if the energy-momentum tensor outside the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole, the conventional first law of thermodynamics will be violated. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and a critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the Van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the conventional first law results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. Moreover, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion, obtaining the minimum inversion temperature and the minimum inversion mass.</description>

Abstract: General theory of relativity is non--linear in nature and therefore can result in hysteresis-like effects and cause systems to remember the footprint of the gravitational field. Here we have investigated this effect using the Kinetic theory in curved spacetime. It is shown that the entropy rate experiences this hysteresis behavior. The effect is then considered for some special spacetimes, including Schwarzschild black hole, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker cosmological solution, and the flat Minkowski spacetime perturbed by a gravitational wave pulse. It is shown that there is some hysteresis effect for the entropy rate.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained. It is shown that the number of quantum states in the resulting theory is twice as large as the number of quantum states of the electromagnetic field in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

Abstract: Analogue gravity is a research programme that explores analogues of general relativistic gravitational fields within other physical systems, particularly but not exclusively in condensed matter systems, with the aim of gaining new insights into related problems. Analogue models of gravity boast a long and distinguished history, dating back to the early years of general relativity. This review article delves into the history, aims, results, and future prospects of various analogue models. We begin by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue model, then traverse the rich history and complex array of models discussed in the literature. The last decade has witnessed significant and sustained advances in analogue gravity, resulting in hundreds of published articles, workshops, and books. The future of the analogue gravity programme looks promising, with rapid technological advances on the experimental front and the potential for analogue models to inspire innovative approaches to the problem of quantum gravity on the theoretical front. Most of all, these recent years have seen the rise of an unprecedented collaboration and interplay between different communities that we believe will set a new standard for interdisciplinary research in the years to come.</description>

Abstract: We identify points of difference between Invariant Set Theory and standard quantum theory, and show that these lead to noticeable differences in predictions between the two theories. We design a number of experiments to test which of these predictions corresponds to our world. If these experiments were undertaken, they would allow us to investigate whether standard quantum theory or invariant set theory best describes reality. These tests can also be deployed on theories sharing similar properties (e.g. Penrose's gravitational collapse theory).</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>

Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional end-to-end simulation for kilonova emission from a black-hole neutron-star merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study long-term evolution of the matter ejected in a black-hole neutron-star (BH-NS) merger employing the results of a long-term numerical-relativity simulation and nucleosynthesis calculation, in which both dynamical and post-merger ejecta formation is consistently followed. In particular, we employ the results for the merger of a $1.35\,M_\odot$ NS and a $5.4\,M_\odot$ BH with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. We confirm the finding in the previous studies that thermal pressure induced by radioactive heating in the ejecta significantly modifies the morphology of the ejecta. We then compute the kilonova (KN) light curves employing the ejecta profile obtained by the long-term evolution. We find that our present BH-NS model results in a KN light curve that is fainter yet more enduring than that observed in AT2017gfo. This is due to the fact that the emission is primarily powered by the lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta, in which a long photon diffusion time scale is realized by the large mass and high opacity. While the peak brightness of the KN emission in both the optical and near-infrared bands is fainter than or comparable to those of binary NS models, the time-scale maintaining the peak brightness is much longer in the near-infrared band for the BH-NS KN model. Our result indicates that a BH-NS merger with massive ejecta can observationally be identified by the long lasting ($&gt;$two weeks) near-infrared emission.</description>

      <title>Relational Lorentzian Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Showcase model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent contribution we identified possible points of contact between the asymptotically safe and canonical approach to quantum gravity. The idea is to start from the reduced phase space (often called relational) formulation of canonical quantum gravity which provides a reduced (or physical) Hamiltonian for the true (observable) degrees of freedom. The resulting reduced phase space is then canonically quantised and one can construct the generating functional of time ordered Wightman (i.e. Feynman) or Schwinger distributions respectively from the corresponding time translation unitary group or contraction semigroup respectively as a path integral. For the unitary choice that path integral can be rewritten in terms of the Lorentzian Einstein Hilbert action plus observable matter action and a ghost action. The ghost action depends on the Hilbert space representation chosen for the canonical quantisation and a reduction term that encodes the reduction of the full phase space to the phase space of observavbles. This path integral can then be treated with the methods of asymptically safe quantum gravity in its {\it Lorentzian} version.
  We also exemplified the procedure using a concrete, minimalistic example namely Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with as many neutral and massless scalar fields as there are spacetime dimensions. However, no explicit calculations were performed. In this paper we fill in the missing steps. Particular care is needed due to the necessary switch to Lorentzian signature which has strong impact on the convergence of ``heat'' kernel time integrals in the heat kernel expansion of the trace involved in the Wetterich equation and which requires different cut-off functions than in the Euclidian version. As usual we truncate at relatively low order and derive and solve the resulting flow equations in that approximation.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Conic Sections on the Sky: Shadows of Linearly Superrotated Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Soft hairs are an intrinsic infrared feature of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study some of the subtleties surrounding one of the primary observables with which we can study their effects in the context of Einstein's gravity: the black hole shadow. First, we clarify the singular pathology associated with black holes with soft hairs and demonstrate that the metrics of linearly superrotated black holes are free of near-zone pathologies due to appropriate asymptotic falloff conditions being imposed on the event horizon. We then analytically construct the photon orbits around such black holes, derive the shadow equation for near-zone observers, and find that the linear superrotation hairs deform the circular shadow of a bald Schwarzchild black hole into an ellipse. This is in sharp contrast to their supertranslated counterparts, which only shift the position of the center of the circular shadow but do not change its shape. Our results suggest a richness to the observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal K\"{a}hler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the $\eta$-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Joint gravitational wave detection by TianQin and LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the detection accuracy of double white dwarfs (DWDs), stellar-mass black hole binaries (SBHBs), light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of astronomical origin for TianQin, LISA, and joint detection. We use a Fisher matrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy over a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains more accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy IMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both contribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB. Nevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter constraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future detection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Long-term Monte Carlo-based neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a black hole-torus system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our new general relativistic Monte Carlo (MC)-based neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code designed to solve axisymmetric systems with several improvements. The main improvements are as follows: (i) the development of an extended version of the implicit MC method for multi-species radiation fields; (ii) modeling of neutrino pair process rates based on a new numerically efficient and asymptotically correct fitting function for the kernel function; (iii) the implementation of new numerical limiters on the radiation-matter interaction to ensure a stable and physically correct evolution of the system. We apply our code to a black hole (BH)-torus system with a BH mass of $3\,M_\odot$, BH dimmensionless spin of 0.8, and a torus mass of $0.1\,M_\odot$, which mimics a post-merger remnant of a binary neutron star merger in the case that the massive neutron star collapses to a BH within a short time scale ($\sim10\,{\rm ms}$). We follow the evolution of the BH-torus system up to more than $1\,{\rm s}$ with our MC-based radiation viscous-hydrodynamics code that dynamically takes into account non-thermal pair annihilation. We find that the system evolution and the various key quantities, such as neutrino luminosity, ejecta mass, torus $Y_e$, and pair annihilation luminosity, are broadly in agreement with the results of the previous studies. We also find that the $\nu_e{\bar \nu}_e$ pair annihilation can launch a relativistic outflow for a time scale of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$, and it can be energetic enough to explain some of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and the precursors. Finally, we calculate the indicators of the fast flavor instability directly from the obtained neutrino distribution functions, which indicate that the instability can occur particularly near the equatorial region of the torus.</description>
