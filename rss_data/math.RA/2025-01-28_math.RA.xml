      <title>Structures of Monoids Motivated by DNA Origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of monoids, called origami monoids, motivated by Jones monoids and by strand organization in DNA origami structures. Two types of basic building blocks of DNA origami closely associated with the graphical representation of Jones monoids are identified and are taken as generators for the origami monoid. Motivated by plausible modifications of the DNA origami structures and the relations of the well studied Jones monoids, we then identify a set of relations that characterize the origami monoid. These relations expand the relations of the Jones monoids and include a new set of relations called contextual commutation. With contextual commutation, certain generators commute only when found within a given context. We prove that the origami monoids are finite and propose a normal form representation of their elements. We establish a correspondence between the Green's classes of the origami monoid and the Green's classes of a direct product of Jones monoids.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras whose derivation algebras are simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is simple exactly when its derivation algebra is simple. In this paper we characterize those Lie algebras of arbitrary dimension over any field that have a simple derivation algebra. As an application we classify the Lie algebras that have a complete simple derivation algebra and are either finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic $p&gt;3$ or $\mathbb{Z}$-graded of finite growth over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>The Free Hamilton Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$, let $p$ and $q$ be monic polynomials with degree $2$ in $\mathbb{F}[t]$. The free Hamilton algebra of the pair $(p,q)$ is the free noncommutative algebra in two generators $a$ and $b$ subject only to the relations $p(a)=0=q(b)$. Free Hamilton algebras are models of free products of two $2$-dimensional algebras over $\mathbb{F}$. They can be viewed as the most elementary nontrivial noncommutative algebras over fields.
  It has been recently observed that the free Hamilton algebra has surprising connections with quaternion algebras. Here, we exploit these connections to investigate its zero divisors, group of units, maximal ideals, finite-dimensional subalgebras, and its automorphism group.</description>

      <title>A note on representations of Lie-Yamaguti algebras induced by left Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that each left Leibniz algebra has a natural structure of a Lie-Yamaguti algebra. In this paper it is shown that every left representation of a left Leibniz algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$ induces naturally a representation of the Lie-Yamaguti algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, [,], [\![ , , ]\!])$ that is associated with $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$. Moreover, it is proved that equivalent representations of $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$ give equivalent representations of $(\mathfrak{g}, [,], [\![ , , ]\!])$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using methods of stable homotopy theory, the category of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves associated with non-commutative graded algebras with extra symmetries is introduced and studied in this paper. It is shown to be a closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck category with invertible generators. It is proven that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a projective scheme is recovered out of symmetric quasi-coherent sheaves.</description>

      <title>Graded Lie algebras of maximal class of type $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebras of the title are infinite-dimensional graded Lie algebras $L= \bigoplus_{i=1}^{\infty}L_i$, over a field of positive characteristic $p$, that are generated by an element of degree $1$ and an element of degree $p$, and satisfy $[L_i,L_1]=L_{i+1}$ for $i\ge p$. In case $p=2$ such algebras were classified by Caranti and Vaughan-Lee in 2003. We announce an extension of that classification to arbitrary prime characteristic, and prove several major steps in its proof.</description>

      <title>An extension of Petek-\v{S}emrl preserver theorems for Jordan embeddings of structural matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M_n$ be the algebra of $n \times n$ complex matrices and $\mathcal{T}_n \subseteq M_n$ the corresponding upper-triangular subalgebra. In their influential work, Petek and \v{S}emrl characterize Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ and $\mathcal{T}_n$, when $n \geq 3$, as (injective in the case of $\mathcal{T}_n$) continuous commutativity and spectrum preserving maps $\phi : M_n \to M_n$ and $\phi : \mathcal{T}_n \to \mathcal{T}_n$. Recently, in a joint work with Petek, the authors extended this characterization to the maps $\phi : \mathcal{A} \to M_n$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is an arbitrary subalgebra of $M_n$ that contains $\mathcal{T}_n$. In particular, any such map $\phi$ is a Jordan embedding and hence of the form $\phi(X)=TXT^{-1}$ or $\phi(X)=TX^tT^{-1}$, for some invertible matrix $T\in M_n$. In this paper we further extend the aforementioned results in the context of structural matrix algebras (SMAs), i.e. subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ of $M_n$ that contain all diagonal matrices. More precisely, we provide both a necessary and sufficient condition for an SMA $\mathcal{A}\subseteq M_n$ such that any injective continuous commutativity and spectrum preserving map $\phi: \mathcal{A} \to M_n$ is necessarily a Jordan embedding. In contrast to the previous cases, such maps $\phi$ no longer need to be multiplicative/antimultiplicative, nor rank-one preservers.</description>

      <title>Cup-one algebras and 1-minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work we introduced the notion of binomial cup-one algebras, which are differential graded algebras endowed with Steenrod $\cup_1$-products and compatible binomial operations. In this paper we show that binomial cup-one algebras capture homotopy 1-type. In particular, given such an $R$-dga, $(A,d_A)$, defined over the ring $R=\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$ (for $p$ a prime), with $H^0(A)=R$ and with $H^1(A)$ a finitely generated, free $R$-module, we show that $A$ admits a functorially defined 1-minimal model, $\rho\colon (\mathcal{M}(A),d)\to (A,d_A)$, which is unique up to isomorphism. Furthermore, we associate to this model a pronilpotent group, whose continuous cohomology is isomorphic to that of $\mathcal{M}(A)$. These constructions, which refine classical notions from rational homotopy theory, allow us to distinguish spaces with isomorphic torsion-free integral cohomology rings. Moreover, we show that there is an equivalence of categories between isomorphism classes of finitely-generated, torsion-free-nilpotent groups and isomorphism classes of finitely generated 1-minimal models over the integers.</description>

      <title>Matsumoto-Yor processes on Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$, where $b$ is a real Brownian motion, is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto-Yor process. Remarkably, it enjoys the Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process to the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property for this generalization.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of discrete-time AX+B Markov chains on the cone of squares whose invariant probability measures classically provide a Dufresne-type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper provides a generalization to any symmetric cone of the initial matrix generalization of the Matsumoto-Yor process and Dufresne identity by Rider-Valk\'o.</description>

      <title>Codes in algebras of direct products of groups and associated quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups. Finally, in the specific case of semisimple dihedral group algebras, we give a method to build quantum error-correcting codes, based on the CSS construction.</description>
