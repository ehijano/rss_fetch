      <title>Polarization and tranverse mode nonlinear dynamics in a broad-area VCSEL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear dynamics and routes to chaos in a broad-area vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (BA-VCSEL) in free-running operation. Accounting for the onset of higher order transverse modes (TMs) unveils additional bifurcations at higher currents not found for single-mode VCSELs (SM-VCSELs). The resulting dynamics involves competition between polarization modes with different transverse profiles and shows good qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Effect of phase-lag on synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions both analytically and numerically in the presence of phase frustration ($\beta$). The higher order topology consists of pairwise and triadic couplings. The analytical framework for the investigation is based on the Ott-Antonsen ansatz which leads to a convenient low-dimensional model. Extensive bifurcation analysis of the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation of the full networks are performed to explore the paths to synchronization. The combined analysis shows a complex dependence of the transition to synchronization on adaptation exponents, coupling strengths, phase lag parameter, and multilayer configuration. Various types of transitions to synchronization, namely continuous, tiered, and explosive, are exhibited by the system in different regions of the parameter space. In all the cases, a satisfactory match between the low-dimensional model and the numerical simulation results is observed. The origin of different transitions to synchronization is clearly understood using the low-dimensional model. Exploration of a wide region of the parameter space suggests that the phase frustration parameter inhibits tired as well as explosive synchronization transitions for fixed triadic coupling strength ($K_2$). On the other hand, discontinuous transition is promoted by the phase frustration parameter for fixed pairwise coupling strength ($K_1$). Moreover, the exponent of the adaptation function with the pairwise coupling decreases the width of the hysteresis, despite the dominance of the higher-order coupling for fixed $\beta$ and $K_2$. While, the exponent of the function adapted with higher-order coupling shows the opposite effect, it promotes bistability in spite of dominance of pairwise coupling strength for fixed $\beta$, and $K_1$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a new class of time periodic attractor solutions in scalar field cosmology, which we term Cosmological Frequency Combs (CFC). These solutions arise in exponential quintessence models with a phantom matter background and exhibit coherent phase-locked oscillations in the scalar field's normalized variables. We demonstrate that such dynamics induce modulations in observables like the Hubble parameter and growth rate, offering a dynamical mechanism to even address the H0 tension exactly. Our results uncover a previously unexplored phase of cosmic acceleration, linking the concept of frequency combs to large scale cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Protected chaos in a topological lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a cornerstone of basic and applied sciences, has been significantly enhanced by quantum sensing strategies. Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes.</description>
