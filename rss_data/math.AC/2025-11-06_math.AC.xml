      <title>Commutative Algebra Modeling in Materials Science -- A Case Study on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of important crystalline and highly porous materials whose hierarchical geometry and chemistry hinder interpretable predictions in materials properties. Commutative algebra is a branch of abstract algebra that has been rarely applied in data and material sciences. We introduce the first ever commutative algebra modeling and prediction in materials science. Specifically, category-specific commutative algebra (CSCA) is proposed as a new framework for MOF representation and learning. It integrates element-based categorization with multiscale algebraic invariants to encode both local coordination motifs and global network organization of MOFs. These algebraically consistent, chemically aware representations enable compact, interpretable, and data efficient modeling of MOF properties such as Henry's constants and uptake capacities for common gases. Compared to traditional geometric and graph-based approaches, CSCA achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy while substantially improving interpretability and stability across data sets. By aligning commutative algebra with the chemical hierarchy, the CSCA establishes a rigorous and generalizable paradigm for understanding structure and property relationships in porous materials and provides a nonlinear algebra-based framework for data-driven material discovery.</description>

      <title>Terracini matroids: algebraic matroids of secants and embedded joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of algebraic geometry have sparked much recent work on algebraic matroids. An algebraic matroid encodes algebraic dependencies among coordinate functions on a variety.
  We study the behavior of algebraic matroids under joins and secants of varieties. Motivated by Terracini's lemma, we introduce the notion of a Terracini union of matroids, which captures when the algebraic matroid of a join coincides with the matroid union of the algebraic matroids of its summands. We illustrate applications of our results with a discussion of the implications for toric surfaces and threefolds.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A new hierarchy for complex plane curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the type of a plane curve as the initial degree of the corresponding Bourbaki ideal. Then we show that this invariant behaves well with respect to the union of curves. Curves of type $0$ are precisely the free curves, while curves of type $1$ are the plus-one generated curves. In this paper, we first show that line arrangements and conic-line arrangements can exhibit all the theoretically possible types. In the second part, we study the properties of the curves of type $2$ and construct families of line arrangements and conic-line arrangements of this type.</description>

      <title>A weak regularity lemma for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A regularity lemma for polynomials provides a decomposition in terms of a bounded number of approximately independent polynomials. Such regularity lemmas play an important role in numerous results, yet suffer from the familiar shortcoming of having tower-type bounds or worse. In this paper we design a new, weaker regularity lemma with strong bounds. The new regularity lemma in particular provides means to quantitatively study the curves contained in the image of a polynomial map, which is beyond the reach of standard methods.
  Applications include strong bounds for a problem of Karam on generalized rank, as well as a new method to obtain upper bounds for fan-in parameters in arithmetic circuits. For example, we show that if the image of a polynomial map $\mathbf{P} \colon \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$ of degree $d$ does not contain a line, then $\mathbf{P}$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ arithmetic formula with bottom fan-in at most $d/2$ and top fan-in at most $(2m)^{C(d)}$ (with $C(d)=2^{(1+o(1))d}$). One implication of our work is a certain ``barrier'' to arithmetic circuit lower bounds, in terms of the smallest degree of a polynomial curve contained in the image of the given polynomial map.</description>
