      <title>ProphetKV: User-Query-Driven Selective Recomputation for Efficient KV Cache Reuse in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02579v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).</description>

      <title>Mitigating Timing-Based Attacks in Real-Time Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time cyber-physical systems depend on deterministic task execution to guarantee safety and correctness. Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality.</description>

      <title>Ringmaster: How to juggle high-throughput host OS system calls from TrustZone TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many safety-critical systems require timely processing of sensor inputs to avoid potential safety hazards. Additionally, to support useful application features, such systems increasingly have a large rich operating system (OS) at the cost of potential security bugs. Thus, if a malicious party gains supervisor privileges, they could cause real-world damage by denying service to time-sensitive programs. Many past approaches to this problem completely isolate time-sensitive programs with a hypervisor; however, this prevents the programs from accessing useful OS services. We introduce Ringmaster, a novel framework that enables enclaves or TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to asynchronously access rich, but potentially untrusted, OS services via Linux's io_uring. When service is denied by the untrusted OS, enclaves continue to operate on Ringmaster's minimal ARM TrustZone kernel with access to small, critical device drivers. This approach balances the need for secure, time-sensitive processing with the convenience of rich OS services. Additionally, Ringmaster supports large unmodified programs as enclaves, offering lower overhead compared to existing systems. We demonstrate how Ringmaster helps us build a working highly-secure system with minimal engineering. In our experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle, Ringmaster achieved nearly 1GiB/sec of data into enclave on a Raspberry Pi4b, 0-3% throughput overhead compared to non-enclave tasks.</description>
