      <title>New horizon in the statistical physics of earthquakes: Dragon-king theory and dragon-king earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic quantitative investigation into whether the mechanisms of large earthquakes are unique could significantly deepen our understanding of fault rupture and seismicity patterns. This research holds the potential to advance our ability to predict large earthquakes and enhance the effectiveness of disaster prevention and mitigation strategies. In 2009, one of us introduced the dragon-king theory, offering a quantitative framework for identifying and testing extreme outliers-referred to as dragon-king events-that are endogenously generated. This theory provides valuable tools for explaining, predicting, and managing the risks associated with these rare but highly impactful events. The present paper discusses the feasibility of applying this theory to seismology, proposing that dragon-king earthquake events can be identified as outliers to the Gutenberg-Richter law. It also examines several seismological mechanisms that may contribute to the occurrence of these extraordinary events. Although applying the dragon-king theory to seismology presents practical challenges, it offers the potential to significantly enrich statistical seismology. By reexamining the classification of earthquake rupture types through a statistical testing lens and integrating these insights with underlying physical mechanisms, this approach can greatly enhance the analytical tools and depth of research in the field of statistical seismology.</description>

      <title>Could Ball Lightning Be Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While magnetic monopoles have extensive theoretical justification for their existence, but have proved elusive to observe, ball lightning is both relatively frequently observed and largely unexplained theoretically. It was first proposed in 1990 that ball lightning might result from the catalysis of nuclear fission by a magnetic monopole. The observed frequency of ball lightning does not conflict with current upper theoretical or observational bounds for magnetic monopole flux. Some possible mechanisms to account for the association of magnetic-monopole-caused ball lightning with thunderstorms are described, and proposals for further observational and theoretical research are made.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Semi-convective Staircases in Rotating Flows: Consequences for Fuzzy Cores in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational constraints on the internal structure of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that these planets have ``fuzzy" cores, i.e., radial gradients of the concentration of heavy elements that might span $50\%$ to $70\%$ of each planet's radius. These cores could be composed of a semi-convective staircase, i.e., multiple convective layers separated by diffusive interfaces arising from double-diffusive instabilities. However, to date, no study has demonstrated how such staircases can avoid layer mergers and persist over evolutionary time scales. In fact, previous work has found that these mergers occur rapidly, quickly leading to only a single convective layer. Using 3D simulations of convective staircases in non-rotating and rotating flows, we demonstrate that rotation prolongs the lifetime of a convective staircase by increasing the timescale for both layer merger and erosion of the interface between the final two layers. We present an analytic model for the erosion phase, predicting that rotation increases the erosion time by a factor of approximately $\mathrm{Ro}^{-1/2}$, where $\mathrm{Ro}$ is the Rossby number of the convective flows (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time). For Jovian conditions at early times after formation (when convection is vigorous enough to mix a large fraction of the planet), we find the erosion time to be roughly $10^{9}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the non-rotating case and $10^{11}~\mathrm{yrs}$ in the rotating case. Thus, the current existence of convective staircases within the deep interiors of giant planets is a strong possibility, and rotation could be an important factor in the preservation of their fuzzy cores.</description>

      <title>Geodynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b</title>

Abstract: Many super-Earths are on very short orbits around their host star and, therefore, more likely to be tidally locked. Because this locking can lead to a strong contrast between the dayside and nightside surface temperatures, these super-Earths could exhibit mantle convection patterns and tectonics that could differ significantly from those observed in the present-day solar system. The presence of an atmosphere, however, would allow transport of heat from the dayside towards the nightside and thereby reduce the surface temperature contrast between the two hemispheres. On rocky planets, atmospheric and geodynamic regimes are closely linked, which directly connects the question of atmospheric thickness to the potential interior dynamics of the planet. Here, we study the interior dynamics of super-Earth GJ 486b ($R=1.34$ $R_{\oplus}$, $M=3.0$ $M_{\oplus}$, T$_\mathrm{eq}\approx700$ K), which is one of the most suitable M-dwarf super-Earth candidates for retaining an atmosphere produced by degassing from the mantle and magma ocean. We investigate how the geodynamic regime of GJ 486b is influenced by different surface temperature contrasts by varying possible atmospheric circulation regimes. We also investigate how the strength of the lithosphere affects the convection pattern. We find that hemispheric tectonics, the surface expression of degree-1 convection with downwellings forming on one hemisphere and upwelling material rising on the opposite hemisphere, is a consequence of the strong lithosphere rather than surface temperature contrast. Anchored hemispheric tectonics, where downwellings und upwellings have a preferred (day/night) hemisphere, is favoured for strong temperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside and higher surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>Indications and implications of a borehole seismic monitoring result of the San Andreas Fault foresee future earthquake prediction</title>

Abstract: The Parkfield M6 earthquake predicted from 1985 by the USGS to happen by 1993 happened 11 years later in 2004 instead. Till today, satisfactory answers to why this earthquake was mis-predicted have not been found. Seven months after the earthquake, we deployed a seismic array in the SAFOD main hole to monitor the San Andreas Fault. During a 13 days period, we recorded 220 earthquake events. By analyzing the projected hypocenters of 100 earthquake events, we found three main active sub-faults, namely SAF1, SAF2, and SAF3, with SAF1 being the normally regarded SAF. During the monitoring period, there was an earthquake migration trend that shows the move of SAF1 drags SAF2, which in turn drags SAF3, to slip and dip downwards. This could be reflected by the result of a geological trenching across the SAF. On SAF1, the smaller earthquakes tended to occur earlier in southeast and the larger earthquakes tended to occur later in northwest, which could indicate the existence of strong asperities. However, the new earthquakes on SAF2 were overall remarkably smaller, which could indicate that during the 2004 M6 earthquake the main underground rupture took place on SAF2, which could extend with a bend near Parkfield town to the Southwest Fracture Zone, and further to include the seemingly isolated 2004 M6 hypocenter. The possible prevailing of this triple active sub-faults model in the Parkfield area may account for 12, 24 or 36 (instead of a single 22 years as previously believed) recurring years of M6 earthquakes, depending on how many of these active sub-faults have basically absorbed the tectonic stress. In less than 0.1% of the earthquake's last intermission time, and at just one location, our borehole seismic monitoring has revealed so much insightful information that earthquake prediction may be feasible if the fault is monitored in boreholes at more locations and for longer periods of time.</description>
