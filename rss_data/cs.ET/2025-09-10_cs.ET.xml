      <title>PSketch: A Priority-Aware Sketch Architecture for Real-Time Flow Monitoring via eBPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch-based monitoring in SDN often suffers from tightly coupled pipeline and memory constraints, limiting algorithmic flexibility and reducing accuracy. We propose PSketch, the first in-kernel priority-aware sketching framework implemented with eBPF. It ensures lossless tracking of high-priority flows via a hash-based table and approximates top-k elephant flows using a sketch pipe. PSketch supports both TCP and UDP and enables in-kernel retransmission tracking with minimal overhead. Unlike SDN-based approaches, it runs on commodity Linux systems, removing hardware dependencies. We perform evaluation on 10 Gbps CAIDA traces. Results show that PSketch achieves 96.0% top-k detection accuracy, 96.4% retransmission recall, and only 0.7% throughput degradation.</description>

      <title>Gut-Brain Axis as a Closed-Loop Molecular Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a quantitative framework for analyzing information transfer within biological systems. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive MC framework for the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a system of six coupled, nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs). The proposed model defines a bidirectional feedback loop with a gut-to-brain inflammatory channel and a brain-to-gut neuroendocrine channel. Under prolonged stress, this feedback loop becomes self-perpetuating and drives the system into a pathological state. We evaluate the end-to-end channel across varying conditions using time-domain simulations, small-signal frequency-domain characterization, and an information-theoretic capacity analysis. At homeostasis, the system maintains stable circadian dynamics with higher information throughput, whereas sustained stress drives a shift to dysregulated hypercortisolism. In this pathological state, spectral efficiency decreases due to a narrowed effective bandwidth and a lower passband gain driven by neuroendocrine delays and saturating cytokine-hormone kinetics. These results quantify the impact of these signaling mechanisms on stability and information processing, elucidating the transition from healthy circadian rhythms to a persistent pathological state of hypercortisolism.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop: Quantitative Evaluation of 3D Models Generation by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models, supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy, to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches, geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Lifelong-Sustainable Electronic-Photonic AI Systems via Extreme Efficiency, Reconfigurability, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07396</link>

Abstract: The relentless growth of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented demand for computational power, straining the energy, bandwidth, and scaling limits of conventional electronic platforms. Electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for next-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high bandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and interconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for sustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and lower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon footprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits, while delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and interconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI systems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and cross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We present how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing both chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer device-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for photonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip area cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI workloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by tolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with EPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and robustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI systems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously meet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for sustainable computing.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.</description>

      <title>Bringing Multi-Modal Multi-Task Federated Foundation Models to Education Domain: Prospects and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently, this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii) the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must be collectively addressed for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>TRMAC: A Time-Reversal-based MAC Protocol for Wireless Networks within Computing Packages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in high-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium Access Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense traffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel cross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time Reversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency channel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless channels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate access using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal resource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer simulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols, achieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds of cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future Wireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where spatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC can be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with a similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting the need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction for MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel physics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.</description>

      <title>From Images to Insights: Explainable Biodiversity Monitoring with Plain Language Habitat Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.
