      <title>Updates on the Tsinghua Tabletop Kibble Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the adoption of the revised International System of Units (SI), the Kibble balance has become a pivotal instrument for mass calibrations against the Planck constant, $h$. One of the major focuses in the Kibble balance community is prioritizing experiments that achieve both high accuracy and compactness. The Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance experiment seeks to develop a compact, high-precision, user-friendly, cost-effective, and open-hardware apparatus for mass realization, specifically within the kilogram range. This paper reports on the progress of the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance project over the past two years. Various aspects of the Tsinghua tabletop system, including electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and optical components, are summarized. Key achievements, such as the construction and characterization of the magnet system, determination of absolute gravitational acceleration, investigation of a capacitor-sensor-based weighing unit, and development of a high-precision current source, are presented to provide a comprehensive understanding of the experiment's status.</description>

      <title>Simulation and analysis of list mode measurements on SILENE reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron time correlation measurements are used to characterize fissile systems. For this purpose, detailed information are obtained using list mode measurements where the neutron detection times are recorded in a file called the time list file. In this article, we present the simulation and analysis of list mode measurements performed on SILENE reactor. Analogue Monte Carlo simulations are performed using MCNPX code and the synthetic time list file is obtained by processing the MCNPX-PTRAC coincidence capture file. Both measured and computed time list files are processed using the same postprocessor that we have developed. This software is used to calculate counting statistics data like counting number probability distribution, Rossi alpha and Feynman functions for time gates of increasing duration. The parameter uncertainties are evaluated using a block bootstrap method.</description>

      <title>Non-magnetic glass-fiber cryostat for MADMAX prototype tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype testing phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a magnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of dielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX prototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks, a new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.25 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested and used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as cooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous helium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below 10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to perform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion search in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat, with a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for other purposes beyond MADMAX.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication and initial test of a novel 3D-Trench sensor utilizing 8-inch CMOS compatible technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D silicon sensor has demonstrated excellent performances (signal collection, detection efficiency, power consumption, etc.) comparable or even better with respect to the traditional planar sensor of the ATLAS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), especially after the high irradiation fluence, mainly due to the shorter drift length of the generated carriers. These characteristics have made it the most attractive technology for the detection and track reconstruction of charged particles for the High Energy Physics (HEP). In addition, its application is also being explored in astronomy, microdosimetry and medical imaging. This paper will present the design and fabrication of a novel 3D-Trench sensor which features an enclosed deep trench surrounding the central columnar cathode. This novel sensor has been fabricated on the 8-inch COMS pilot line at the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS) where ultra-narrow etch width of 0.5 {\mu}m and the ultra-high depth-to-width ratio (aspect ratio) (&gt;70) have been achieved. Its preliminary simulation and characterization results including electrostatic potential, electric field, Current-Voltage (IV), Capacitance-Voltage (CV), Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) and Timing Performance before irradiation will be presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Proton irradiation on Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon flexible devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation damage tests in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) flexible flux and dose-measuring devices have been performed with a 3 MeV proton beam, to evaluate combined displacement and total ionizing dose damage. The tested devices had two different configurations and thicknesses. The first device was a 2 um thick n-i-p diode having a 5 mm x 5 mm area. The second device was a 5 um thick charge selective contact detector having the same area. Both the devices were deposited on a flexible polyimide substrate and were irradiated up to the fluence of 1016 neq/cm2. The response to different proton fluxes has been measured before irradiation and after irradiation at 1016 neq/cm2 for charge-selective contacts and n-i-p devices. The effect of annealing for partial performance recovery at 100{\deg}C for 12 hours was also studied and a final characterization on annealed devices was performed. This test is the first combined displacement and total ionizing dose test on flexible a-Si:H devices.</description>

      <title>Search for new interactions at the micron scale with a vector force sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for new gravity-like interactions at the sub-millimeter scale is a compelling area of research, with important implications for the understanding of classical gravity and its connections with quantum physics. We report improved constraints on Yukawa-type interactions in the $10\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ regime using optically levitated dielectric microspheres as test masses. The search is performed, for the first time, sensing multiple spatial components of the force vector, and with sensitivity improved by a factor of $\sim 100$ with respect to previous measurements using the same technique. The resulting upper limit on the strength of a hypothetical new force is $10^7$ at a Yukawa range $\lambda\simeq 5\;\mu$m and close to $10^6$ for $\lambda \gtrsim 10\;\mu$m. This result also advances our efforts to measure gravitational effects using micrometer-size objects, with important implications for embryonic ideas to investigate the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Loss rate of ultracold neutrons due to the absorption by trap walls in large material traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most accurate neutron lifetime measurements now use the material or magnetic traps of ultracold neutrons (UCN). The precision of these experiments is determined by the accuracy of estimating the neutron loss rate. In material UCN traps the main source of neutron losses is the absorption by trap walls. In this paper we analyze the standard methods and their approximations for the calculation of UCN absorption rate by the walls of material traps. We emphasize the approximations used both in the standard analytical formulas and in the numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. For the two simplest trap geometries, rectangular and cylindrical, we obtain analytical formulas for this absorption rate provided the UCN velocity distribution is isotropic at trap bottom. Then we perform numerical calculations of UCN velocity distribution and absorption rate taking into account the diffuse elastic UCN reflections by trap walls obeying two different laws: Lambert`s cosine law and isotropic reflection. We compare the results with the standard estimation methods and discuss the differences. We indicate the difference between the UCN number and density velocity distribution. Our results may be useful to resolve the puzzling four-second discrepancy between the magnetic and material-trap measurements of neutron lifetime.</description>

      <title>Sensor response and radiation damage effects for 3D pixels in the ATLAS IBL Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixel sensors in 3D technology equip the outer ends of the staves of the Insertable B Layer (IBL), the innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector, which was installed before the start of LHC Run 2 in 2015. 3D pixel sensors are expected to exhibit more tolerance to radiation damage and are the technology of choice for the innermost layer in the ATLAS tracker upgrade for the HL-LHC programme. While the LHC has delivered an integrated luminosity of $\simeq$ 235 fb$^{-1}$ since the start of Run 2, the 3D sensors have received a non-ionising energy deposition corresponding to a fluence of ${\simeq} 8.5\times10^{14}$ 1 MeV neutron-equivalent cm$^{-2}$ averaged over the sensor area. This paper presents results of measurements of the 3D pixel sensors' response during Run 2 and the first two years of Run 3, with predictions of its evolution until the end of Run 3 in 2025. Data are compared with radiation damage simulations, based on detailed maps of the electric field in the Si substrate, at various fluence levels and bias voltage values. These results illustrate the potential of 3D technology for pixel applications in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Photon energy reconstruction with the MEG II liquid xenon calorimeter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MEG II experiment searches for a charged-lepton-flavour-violating $\mu \to e \gamma$ with the target sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{-14}$. A liquid xenon calorimeter with VUV-sensitive photosensors measures photon position, timing, and energy. This paper concentrates on the precise photon energy reconstruction with the MEG II liquid xenon calorimeter. Since a muon beam rate is $3\text{-}5 \times 10^{7}~\text{s}^{-1}$, multi-photon elimination analysis is performed using waveform analysis techniques such as a template waveform fit. As a result, background events in the energy range of 48-58 MeV were reduced by 34 %. The calibration of the energy scale of the calorimeter with several calibration sources is also discussed to achieve a high resolution of 1.8 %.</description>

      <title>All-mirror wavefront division interferometer for mid-infrared spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the design of an all-mirror wavefront-division interferometer capable of spectroscopic studies across multiple spectral ranges$\unicode{x2013}$from the plasma frequencies of metals to terahertz wavelengths and beyond. The proposed method leverages the properties of laser sources with high spatial coherence. A theoretical framework for the interferometer scheme is presented, along with an analytical solution for determining the far-field interference pattern, which is validated through both optical propagation simulations and experimental results. The practical implementation of the spectrometer, using cost-effective off-the-shelf components (knife-edge prisms for separation and recombination), is demonstrated. The system features ultra-broad optical bandwidth, high throughput, simple architecture, dispersion-free operation, and variable arm split ratio. These unique attributes make our approach a prospective alternative to standard Fourier transform spectrometer schemes, specifically tailored to laser-based scenarios. Further, the employed design inherently enables the measurement of the sample's dispersion. In the experimental section, we demonstrate the feasibility of spectroscopic measurements by coupling the system with a supercontinuum source with more than an octave-spanning range (1.5 $cm^{-1}$ - 4.4 $cm^{-1}$). As a proof-of-concept, an experimental demonstration is provided for various applied spectroscopic studies: transmission measurements of polymers (polypropylene) and gas (methane), as well as reflectance measurements of dried pharmaceuticals (insulin products on a metal surface).</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>
