      <title>Universal Dynamics of Financial Bubbles in Isolated Markets: Evidence from the Iranian Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative bubbles exhibit common statistical signatures across many financial markets, suggesting the presence of universal underlying mechanisms. We test this hypothesis in the Iranian stock market, an economy that is highly isolated, subject to capital controls, and largely inaccessible to foreign investors. Using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, we analyze two major bubble episodes in 2020 and 2023. The estimated critical exponents beta around 0.46 and 0.20 fall within the empirical ranges documented for canonical historical bubbles such as the 1929 DJIA crash and the 2000 Nasdaq episode. The Tehran Stock Exchange displays clear LPPLS hallmarks, including faster-than-exponential price acceleration, log-periodic corrections, and stable estimates of the critical time horizon. These results indicate that endogenous herding, imitation, and positive-feedback dynamics, rather than exogenous shocks, play a dominant role even in politically and economically isolated markets. By showing that an emerging and semi-closed financial system conforms to the same dynamical patterns observed in global markets, this paper provides new empirical support for the universality of bubble dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, it also presents the first systematic LPPLS analysis of bubbles in the Tehran Stock Exchange. The findings highlight the usefulness of LPPLS-based diagnostic tools for monitoring systemic risk in emerging or restricted economies.</description>

      <title>Extending the application of dynamic Bayesian networks in calculating market risk: Standard and stressed expected shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last five years, expected shortfall (ES) and stressed ES (SES) have become key required regulatory measures of market risk in the banking sector, especially following events such as the global financial crisis. Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&amp;P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation.</description>

      <title>Credit Risk Estimation with Non-Financial Features: Evidence from a Synthetic Istanbul Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial exclusion constrains entrepreneurship, increases income volatility, and widens wealth gaps. Underbanked consumers in Istanbul often have no bureau file because their earnings and payments flow through informal channels. To study how such borrowers can be evaluated we create a synthetic dataset of one hundred thousand Istanbul residents that reproduces first quarter 2025 T\"U\.IK census marginals and telecom usage patterns. Retrieval augmented generation feeds these public statistics into the OpenAI o3 model, which synthesises realistic yet private records. Each profile contains seven socio demographic variables and nine alternative attributes that describe phone specifications, online shopping rhythm, subscription spend, car ownership, monthly rent, and a credit card flag. To test the impact of the alternative financial data CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost are each trained in two versions. Demo models use only the socio demographic variables; Full models include both socio demographic and alternative attributes. Across five fold stratified validation the alternative block raises area under the curve by about one point three percentage and lifts balanced \(F_{1}\) from roughly 0.84 to 0.95, a fourteen percent gain. We contribute an open Istanbul 2025 Q1 synthetic dataset, a fully reproducible modeling pipeline, and empirical evidence that a concise set of behavioural attributes can approach bureau level discrimination power while serving borrowers who lack formal credit records. These findings give lenders and regulators a transparent blueprint for extending fair and safe credit access to the underbanked.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Machine Learning? Regularization and Forecast Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard forecast efficiency tests interpret violations as evidence of behavioral bias. We show theoretically and empirically that rational forecasters using optimal regularization systematically violate these tests. Machine learning forecasts show near zero bias at one year horizon, but strong overreaction at two years, consistent with predictions from a model of regularization and measurement noise. We provide three complementary tests: experimental variation in regularization parameters, cross-sectional heterogeneity in firm signal quality, and quasi-experimental evidence from ML adoption around 2013. Technically trained analysts shift sharply toward overreaction post-2013. Our findings suggest reported violations may reflect statistical sophistication rather than cognitive failure.</description>

      <title>Why is the volatility of single stocks so much rougher than that of the S&amp;P500?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nested factor model was introduced by Chicheportiche et al. to represent non-linear correlations between stocks. Stock returns are explained by a standard factor model, but the (log)-volatilities of factors and residuals are themselves decomposed into factor modes, with a common dominant volatility mode affecting both market and sector factors but also residuals. Here, we consider the case of a single factor where the only dominant log-volatility mode is rough, with a Hurst exponent $H \simeq 0.11$ and the log-volatility residuals are ''super-rough'' or ''multifractal'', with $H \simeq 0$. We demonstrate that such a construction naturally accounts for the somewhat surprising stylized fact reported by Wu et al. , where it has been observed that the Hurst exponents of stock indexes are large compared to those of individual stocks. We propose a statistical procedure to estimate the Hurst factor exponent from the stock returns dynamics together with theoretical guarantees of its consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments and apply it to daily stock data from the S&amp;P500 index. The estimated roughness exponents for both the factor and idiosyncratic components validate the assumptions underlying our model.</description>

      <title>The Memorization Problem: Can We Trust LLMs' Economic Forecasts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) cannot be trusted for economic forecasts during periods covered by their training data. Counterfactual forecasting ability is non-identified when the model has seen the realized values: any observed output is consistent with both genuine skill and memorization. Any evidence of memorization represents only a lower bound on encoded knowledge. We demonstrate LLMs have memorized economic and financial data, recalling exact values before their knowledge cutoff. Instructions to respect historical boundaries fail to prevent recall-level accuracy, and masking fails as LLMs reconstruct entities and dates from minimal context. Post-cutoff, we observe no recall. Memorization extends to embeddings.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>
