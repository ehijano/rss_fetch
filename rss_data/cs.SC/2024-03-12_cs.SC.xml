      <title>Solving the p-Riccati Equations and Applications to the Factorisation of Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solutions of the equation f^{ (p--1) }+ f^p = h^p in the unknown function f overan algebraic function field of characteristic p are very closely linked to the structure and fac-torisations of linear differential operators with coefficients in function fields of characteristic p.However, while being able to solve this equation over general algebraic function fields is necessaryeven for operators with rational coefficients, no general resolution method has been developed.We present an algorithm for testing the existence of solutions in polynomial time in the ``size''of h and an algorithm based on the computation of Riemann-Roch spaces and the selection ofelements in the divisor class group, for computing solutions of size polynomial in the ``size'' of hin polynomial time in the size of h and linear in the characteristic p, and discuss its applicationsto the factorisation of linear differential operators in positive characteristic p.</description>

      <title>ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with Large Language Models via Argumentation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two main barriers to using large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning. Firstly, while LLMs exhibit significant promise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance in complex reasoning and planning falls short of expectations. Secondly, LLMs use uninterpretable methods to make clinical decisions that are fundamentally different from the clinician's cognitive processes. This leads to user distrust. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents, which aims to enable LLM-based agents to make explainable clinical decision reasoning through interaction. ArgMed-Agents performs self-argumentation iterations via Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (a reasoning mechanism for modeling cognitive processes in clinical reasoning), and then constructs the argumentation process as a directed graph representing conflicting relationships. Ultimately, Reasoner(a symbolic solver) identify a series of rational and coherent arguments to support decision. ArgMed-Agents enables LLMs to mimic the process of clinical argumentative reasoning by generating explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner. The setup experiments show that ArgMed-Agents not only improves accuracy in complex clinical decision reasoning problems compared to other prompt methods, but more importantly, it provides users with decision explanations that increase their confidence.</description>

      <title>Provability in BI's Sequent Calculus is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02343v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warning: This paper contains a mistake, rendering the proof of the main theorem invalid. The logic of Bunched Implications (BI) combines both additive and multiplicative connectives, which include two primitive intuitionistic implications. As a consequence, contexts in the sequent presentation are not lists, nor multisets, but rather tree-like structures called bunches. This additional complexity notwithstanding, the logic has a well-behaved metatheory admitting all the familiar forms of semantics and proof systems. However, the presentation of an effective proof-search procedure has been elusive since the logic's debut. We show that one can reduce the proof-search space for any given sequent to a primitive recursive set, the argument generalizing Gentzen's decidability argument for classical propositional logic and combining key features of Dyckhoff's contraction-elimination argument for intuitionistic logic. An effective proof-search procedure, and hence decidability of provability, follows as a corollary.</description>
