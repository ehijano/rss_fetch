      <title>Projective limits of probabilistic symmetries and their applications to random graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We couple projective limits of probability measures to direct limits of their symmetry groups. We show that the direct limit group is the group of symmetries of the projective limit probability measure. If projective systems of probability measures represent point processes in increasingly larger finite regions of the same infinite space, then we show that under some additional niceness and consistency assumptions, an extension of the direct limit group is the symmetry group of the projective limit point process in the whole infinite space. The application of these results to random graph limits provides ``shortest paths'' to graphons and graphexes as it recovers these random graph limits as trivial corollaries. Another application example encompasses a broad class of limits of random graphs with bounded average degrees. This class includes a representative collection of paradigmatic random graph models that have attracted significant research attention in diverse areas of science. Our approach thus provides a general unified framework to study limits of very different types of random graphs.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of the Abstract Random Tensor Estimate by Deng, Nahmod, and Yue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the abstract random tensor estimate, which was established by Deng, Nahmod, and Yue (2022) using the moment method. The key new tool is the direct use of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality with the probabilistic decoupling of the product of Gaussians. We use Hermite and generalized Laguerre-type polynomials allow us to account for pairings in the real and complex-valued Gaussians, respectively, and remove the square-free (tetrahedral) requirement.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian Transition Probability and Correlation Kernel of TASEP in Half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the transition probability for the asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-space for general initial conditions and particle insertion at the boundary. In the limit of total asymmetry, where particles only jump to the right, we show that the transition probability reduces to a single Pfaffian for a large class of initial conditions. We further derive a Fredholm Pfaffian formula for the multipoint distribution of the totally asymmetric model conditioned on the number of particles in the system using a connection with a Pfaffian point process supported on Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.</description>

      <title>Ursell functions in lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ursell functions $U_n$ are higher-order generalizations of the covariance function, which capture the interactions between $n$ random variables. In the classical Ising model, as shown by Shlosman, when considering the spins at some locations, the sign of $U_{2n}$ alternates with $n$ and is independent of the locations of the spins considered. In this paper, we study the Ursell function in Ising lattice gauge theory. When the spins at the edges are used as random variables, we show that $U_n$ can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the configuration and the parameter $\beta$. When considering Wilson loops observables as random variables, using the tool of cluster expansion adapted to this setting, we prove that at sufficiently low temperature, for any number $n$ of disjoint Wilson loops, there exists a configuration of loops such that the Ursell function $U_n$ is positive. These results contrast sharply with the behavior observed for the Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a concise presentation of the construction of the Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, i.e., the spectrum associated to the infinitesimal generator of Liouville Brownian motion, the canonical diffusion in the geometry of LQG. We describe the recently obtained Weyl law in this context (giving a short summary of its proof) and report on some work in progress concerning the associated heat trace. Finally, we summarise and propose some new key open problems in this direction.</description>

      <title>Worst-case mixing estimates for Brownian motion with semipermeable barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing properties of a Brownian motion whose movements are hindered by semipermeable barriers. Our setting assumes that the process takes values in a smooth planar domain and that the barriers are one-dimensional closed curves. We establish an upper bound on the mixing time and a lower bound on the stationary distribution in terms of geometric parameters. These worst-case bounds decay at an exponential rate as the domain grows large, and we give examples that show that exponential decay is necessary in our worst-case setting.</description>

      <title>Fine-Graining and Continuous Space Scaling Limit of the $H^{2|2}$ Model on the Hierarchical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the exact coarse-graining result of Disertori, Merkl and Rolles~\cite{MR4517733} for the random field of $H^{2|2}$-model to the random Schr\"odinger operator representation of the $H^{2|2}$-model. We also introduce a fine-graining procedure as the reverse operation, and establish an associated exponential martingale property. Applying this fine-graining procedure to the $H^{2|2}$-model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice, we establish its continuous space scaling limit as a non-trivial random measure on $[0,1]$.
  This random measure is almost surely singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure if and only if the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process on the Dyson hierarchical lattice is recurrent. If the process is transient, the random measure almost surely has an absolutely continuous component. The density of this component is everywhere non-trivial and can be identified with the pointwise limit of an exponential martingale associated with the $H^{2|2}$-model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice.</description>

      <title>Loewner--Kufarev entropy and large deviations of the Hastings--Levitov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hastings--Levitov HL(0) model in the small particle scaling limit and prove a large deviation principle. The rate function is given by the relative entropy of the driving measure $\rho$ for the Loewner--Kufarev equation:
  \[
  H(\rho) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\iint \bar{\rho}_t(\theta) \log \bar{\rho}_t(\theta) d\theta dt,
  \]
  whenever $\rho = \bar{\rho}_t d\theta dt/2\pi$ with $\int_{S^1} \bar{\rho}_t d\theta/2\pi = 1$.
  We investigate the class of shapes that can be generated by finite entropy Loewner evolution and show that it contains all Weil-Petersson quasicircles, all Becker quasicircles, a Jordan curve with a cusp, and a non-simple curve. We also consider the problem of finding a measure of minimal entropy generating a given shape as well as a simplified version of the problem for a related transport equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for additive functionals of particle systems via Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider additive functionals of systems of random measures whose initial configuration is given by a Poisson point process, and whose individual components evolve according to arbitrary Markovian or non-Markovian measure valued dynamics, with no structural assumptions beyond basic moment bounds. In this setting and under adequate conditions, we establish a general third moment theorem for the normalized functionals. Building on this result, we obtain the first quantitative bounds in the Wasserstein distance for a variety of moving-measure models initialized by Poisson-driven clouds of points, turning qualitative central limit theorems into explicit rates of convergence. The scope of the approach is then demonstrated through several examples, including systems driven by fractional Brownian motion, $\alpha$-stable processes, uniformly elliptic diffusions, and spectral empirical measures arising from Dyson Brownian motion, all under broad assumptions on the control measure of the initial Poisson configuration. The analysis relies on a combination of Stein's method with Mecke's formula, in the spirit of the Poisson Malliavin-Stein methodology.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parallel transport on the Wasserstein space and equivariant diffusions on the group of diffeomorphisms over a closed Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of solutions to stochastic differential equations on the Wasserstein space over a closed Riemannian manifold, under suitable regularity assumptions on the driving vector fields. Interpreting the diffeomorphism group $\mathscr{D}$ as a Riemannian submersion onto the smooth Wasserstein space $\P_\infty$, we further prove the existence and uniqueness of the stochastic parallel parallel transport along diffusions on $\P_\infty$. Finally, we show that equivariant diffusions on $\mathscr{D}$ endowed with a principal bundle structure over $\P_\infty$ admit a unique factorization into a horizontal diffusion and a vertical component expressed as a right exponential of a process taking values in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of the group $G$ of volume preserving diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The Gamma-disordered Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-parameter family of random edge weights on the Aztec diamond graph, given by certain Gamma variables, and prove several results about the corresponding random dimer measures.
  Firstly, we show there is no phase transition at the level of the free energy. This provides rigorous backing for the physics predictions of Zeng-Leath-Hwa and later works that dimer models with random weights are in the glassy `super-rough' phase at all temperatures with no phase transition.
  Secondly, we show that the random dimer covers themselves enjoy exact distributional equalities of certain marginals with path locations in new `hybrid' integrable polymers. These reduce to the stationary log-Gamma, strict-weak, and Beta polymer in random environment in certain cases, allowing transfer of known results from integrable polymers to dimers with random weights. As an example application, we prove that the turning points at the boundaries of the Aztec diamond exhibit fluctuations of order $n^{2/3}$, in contrast to the $n^{1/2}$ fluctuations for deterministic weights.
  Underlying all these is a key integrability property of the weights: they are the unique family for which independence is preserved under the shuffling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sampling on Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric graphs are structures obtained by associating edges in a standard graph with segments of the real line and gluing these segments at the vertices of the graph. The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport. Our algorithm is able to run stable simulations with timesteps significantly larger than the stable limit of the finite volume method used in DuMuX while also achieving speedups of up to ~1500x.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Various Squash Shots and Skill Study of Different Levels of Squash Players and Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compact probabilistic model for two-player and two-team (four-player) squash matches, along with a practical skill-comparison rule derived from point-scoring probabilities. Using recorded shot types and court locations, we analyze how shot distributions differ between professional-level and intermediate-level players. Our analysis shows that professional players use a wider variety of shots and favor backcourt play to maintain control, while intermediate players concentrate more on mid-court shots, generate more errors, and exercise less positional control. These results quantify strategic differences in squash, offer a simple method to compare player and team skill, and provide actionable insights for sports analytics and coaching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free boundary $q$-Whittaker and Hall--Littlewood processes, two probability measures on sequences of partitions. We prove that a certain observable of the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process exhibits a $(q,t)$ symmetry after a random shift, generalizing a previous result of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto, and an extension of that result due to the first author. Our proof is completely different, and as part of our proof, we find contour integral formulas for the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process. We also show a matching between certain observables in the free boundary Hall--Littlewood process and a quasi-open six vertex model, and explain how work of Finn and Vanicat gives an evaluation of a bounded sum over skew Hall--Littlewood functions as a rectangular Koornwinder polynomial.</description>

      <title>Markov Chains Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have long been observed to obtain near-optimal performance in various Bayesian inference settings. However, developing a supporting theory that make these studies rigorous has proved challenging.
  In this paper, we study the classical spiked Wigner inference problem, where one aims to recover a planted Boolean spike from a noisy matrix measurement. We relate the recovery performance of Glauber dynamics on the annealed posterior to the performance of Approximate Message Passing (AMP), which is known to achieve Bayes-optimal performance. Our main results rely on the analysis of an auxiliary Markov chain called restricted Gaussian dynamics (RGD). Concretely, we establish the following results:
  1. RGD can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional recursion which mirrors the evolution of the AMP iterates.
  2. From a warm start, RGD rapidly converges to a fixed point in correlation space, which recovers Bayes-optimal performance when run on the posterior.
  3. Conditioned on widely believed mixing results for the SK model, we recover the phase transition for non-trivial inference.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Time of the Symmetric Noisy Voter Model with Arbitrary Initial and Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of imitation and herding behavior often underestimate the role of individualistic actions and assume symmetric boundary conditions. However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large.

      <title>A Note on the Conditions for COS Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the truncation error of the COS method and give simple, verifiable conditions that guarantee convergence. In one dimension, COS is admissible when the density belongs to both L1 and L2 and has a finite weighted L2 moment of order strictly greater than one. We extend the result to multiple dimensions by requiring the moment order to exceed the dimension. These conditions enlarge the class of densities covered by previous analyses and include heavy-tailed distributions such as Student t with small degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum of passive scalar turbulence through anomalous regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum predicts the distribution of Fourier mass for a passive scalar field advected by a "turbulent" velocity field with spatial regularity $C^\alpha_x$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and subject to a time-stationary forcing. We prove the Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum holds after summing over geometric annuli in Fourier space -- up to logarithmic corrections -- as a consequence of a sharp anomalous regularization result. We then prove this anomalous regularization for a broad class of Kraichnan-type models. The proof of anomalous regularization relies on a Fourier space $\ell^p$ energy equality and a weighted lattice Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of very short character sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem of $(1/\sqrt{h_p})\sum_{X&lt; n \leq X+h_p}\big(\tfrac{n}{p}\big)$ for almost all the primes $p$, with $X$ uniformly random in $[g(p)]$, $g(p)$ an arbitrary divergent function growing slower than any power of $p$, provided $(\log h_p)/(\log g(p))\rightarrow 0, \, h_p \rightarrow \infty$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$. This improves the recent results of Basak, Nath and Zaharescu, who established this for $g(p) = (\log p)^A, A&gt;1$. We also use the best currently available tools to expand the original central limit theorem of Davenport and Erd\H{o}s for all the primes to a shorter interval of starting points.
  In this paper we exploit a Selberg's sieve argument, recently used by Harper, an intersection result due to Evertse and Silverman and some consequences of the Weil bound on general character sums.</description>

Abstract: We study the distributional behavior of additive arithmetic functions evaluated at integers drawn from the harmonic distribution. Our main result shows that a broad family of such functions converges in law to conditioned Dickman-type limits. This contrasts with the Gaussian limits of the classical Erd\"os-Kac theorem for uniform samples. Our perspective combines the probabilistic representation of harmonic samples via independent geometric variables with analytic inputs such as Mertens' approximation, together with a Poissonization procedure</description>

      <title>Shotgun assembly of random regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1512.08473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mossel and Ross (2019) introduce the shotgun assembly problem for random graphs: what radius $R$ ensures that the random graph $G$ can be uniquely recovered from its list of rooted $R$-neighborhoods, with high probability? Here we consider this question for random regular graphs of fixed degree $d\ge3$. A result of Bollob\'as (1982) implies efficient recovery at $R = (1 + \epsilon) \frac12 \log_{d-1}n$ with high probability -- moreover, this recovery algorithm uses only a summary of the distances in each neighborhood. We show that using the full neighborhood structure gives a sharper bound \[
  R = \frac{\log n + \log\log n}{2\log(d-1)} + O(1)\,, \] which we prove is tight up to the $O(1)$ term. One consequence of our proof is that if $G,H$ are independent graphs where $G$ follows the random regular law, then with high probability the graphs are non-isomorphic; furthermore, this can be efficiently certified by testing the $R$-neighborhood list of $H$ against the $R$-neighborhood of a single adversarially chosen vertex of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of random walks on $\mathbb Z^d$ ($d\ge1$) in deterministic reversible environments defined by an assignment of a positive conductance to each edge of $\mathbb Z^d$. We identify a deterministic set of conductance configurations for which the walk obeys an Invariance Principle; i.e., converges in law to a non-degenerate Brownian motion under diffusive scaling of space and time. This set is closed under translations and zero-density perturbations and carries all ergodic conductance laws subject to certain moment conditions. The proofs rely on martingale approximations whose main step is the conversion of averages in time and physical space under the deterministic environment to those in a suitable stochastic counterpart. Our study sets up a framework for "de-randomized homogenization" of other motions in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Gaussian universality for approximately polynomial functions of high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian universality results assert that the properties of many estimators remain unchanged when the input data are replaced by Gaussians. Such results have gained popularity in high-dimensional statistics and machine learning, as Gaussianity often substantially simplifies downstream analyses. Yet, an open question remains on when universality may cease to hold. To address this, we establish nearly optimal upper and lower bounds for Gaussian universality approximation, measured in Kolmogorov distance, over the class of approximately polynomial functions of high-dimensional random vectors. The upper bounds adapt the invariance principle of Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz (2010) for high-dimensional vectors and functions beyond multilinear forms. As applications, we obtain a delta method for high-dimensional data with non-Gaussian limits, a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic normality, and simple estimators that are asymptotically normal but for which bootstrap fails to be consistent. We also extend recent results on the high-dimensional degeneracy of non-degenerate U-statistics, phase transition of MMD in two-sample tests with imbalanced data, and confidence spheres for high-dimensional averages. Our lower bound is constructive and shows that, for polynomials of even degree $m$, universality holds up to $m=o(\log n)$. As a corollary, the Gaussian polynomial approximation error of $\Omega(n^{-1/6m})$ is not improvable for even-degree U-statistics and V-statistics. Our results also explain how universality results for U-statistics and V-statistics differ significantly in their dependence on dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

Abstract: In the article, we find the asymptotic distribution of the derivative of the taut string accompanying a Wiener process in a strip of fixed width on long time intervals. This enables to find explicit expressions for minimal energy (averaged function of the derivative) of an absolutely continuous function in this strip. For example, for kinetic energy which was considered earlier by Lifshits and Setterqvist, the minimal energy per unit of time tends to $\pi^2/6r^2$ where $r$ is the strip width.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, a smaller gap between Hurst index and H\"older exponent implies stability for larger noise amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR processes: Weak-error bounds and option pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper links nearly unstable, heavy-tailed \emph{bivariate cumulative} INAR($\infty$) processes to the rough Heston model via a discrete scaling limit, extending scaling-limit techniques beyond Hawkes processes and providing a microstructural mechanism for rough volatility and leverage effect. Computationally, we simulate the \emph{approximating INAR($\infty$)} sequence rather than discretizing the Volterra SDE, and implement the long-memory convolution with a \emph{divide-and-conquer FFT} (CDQ) that reuses past transforms, yielding an efficient Monte Carlo engine for \emph{European options} and \emph{path-dependent options} (Asian, lookback, barrier). We further derive finite-horizon \emph{weak-error bounds} for option pricing under our microstructural approximation. Numerical experiments show tight confidence intervals with improved efficiency; as $\alpha \to 1$, results align with the classical Heston benchmark, where $\alpha$ is the roughness specification. Using the simulator, we also study the \emph{implied-volatility surface}: the roughness specification ($\alpha&lt;1$) reproduces key empirical features -- most notably the steep short-maturity ATM skew with power-law decay -- whereas the classical model produces a much flatter skew.</description>

Abstract: We establish a limit theorem for a new model of 3-dimensional random walk in an inhomogeneous lattice with random orientations. This model can be seen as a 3dimensional version of the Matheron and de Marsily model [12]. This new model leads us naturally to the study of iterated random walk in random scenery, which is a new process that can be described as a random walk in random scenery evolving in a second random scenery. We use the french acronym PAPAPA for this new process and answer a question about its stochastic behaviour asked about twenty years ago by St{\'e}phane Le Borgne.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $\varphi^4_3$ model satisfies a version of Segal's axioms in the special case of three-dimensional tori and cylinders. As a consequence, we give the first proof that this model satisfies a Markov property and we characterize its boundary law up to absolutely continuous perturbations. In addition, we use Segal's axioms to give an alternative construction of the $\varphi^4_3$ Hamiltonian on two-dimensional tori as compared with Glimm (Comm. Math. Phys., 1968). We exploit this probabilistic approach to prove novel fundamental spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, such as discrete spectrum and a Perron-Froebenius type result on its ground state. The key technical contributions of this article are the development of tools to analyze $\varphi^4_3$ models with rough boundary conditions. We heavily use the variational approach to $\varphi^4_3$ models introduced in Barashkov and Gubinelli (Duke, 2020) that is based on the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula and dual to Polchinski's continuous renormalization group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $S$ transforms of Jacobi processes in the frameworks of free and finite free probability theories. We begin by deriving a partial differential equation satisfied by the free $S$ transform of the free Jacobi process, and we provide a detailed analysis of its characteristic curves. We turn next our attention to the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian Jacobi process and to the dynamic of its roots, referred to as the \emph{frozen Jacobi process}. In particular, we prove, for a specific set of parameters, that the former aligns up to a Szeg\"o variable transformation with the Hermite unitary polynomial. We also provide an expansion of the averaged characteristic polynomial of the Hermitian process in the basis of Jacobi polynomials. Finally, we establish the convergence of the frozen Jacobi process to the free Jacobi process in high dimensions by using the finite free S transform. In doing so, we prove a general result, interesting in its own, on the convergence of the finite differences of the finite free $S$ transform, which paves the way to obtain asymptotics of differential-difference equations satisfied by time-dependent finite free S-transforms of polynomial sequences with positive roots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study is devoted to the interpretation and wellposedness of the stochastic NLS model \begin{equation*} (\imath \partial\_t-\Delta)u=|u|^2+\dot{B}, \quad u\_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \R, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation*} where $\dot{B}$ stands for a space-time fractional noise with index $H=(H\_0,H\_1)$ in a subset of $(0,1)^{2}$. \\ \indent We first establish that in the situation where $0&lt;2H\_0+H\_1\leq 2$, the equation cannot be interpreted in a (classical) functional sense.\\ \indent Our investigations then focus on the rough regime corresponding to the condition $\frac74&lt;2H\_0+H\_1\leq 2$. In this specific case, we exhibit an \textit{explicit} renormalization procedure allowing to restore the (local) convergence of the approximated solutions. \\ \indent We follow a pathwise-type approach emphasizing the distinction between the stochastic objects at the core of the dynamics and the general deterministic machinery.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

      <title>Correlation thresholds in the steady states of particle systems and spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Correlated Spiked Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked matrices $$ X=\tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xu^{\top}+W, \quad Y=\tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yv^{\top}+Z $$ where the spikes $x,y$ have correlation $\rho$. Specifically, we consider two fundamental models: (1) Correlated spiked Wigner model with signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda,\mu$; (2) Correlated spiked $n*N$ Wishart (covariance) model with signal-to-noise ratio $\sqrt\lambda,\sqrt\mu$.
  We propose an efficient detection and estimation algorithm based on counting a specific family of edge-decorated cycles. The algorithm's performance is governed by the function $$ F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\gamma)=\max\Big\{ \frac{ \lambda^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \mu^2 }{ \gamma }, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ \gamma-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,. $$ We prove our algorithm succeeds for the correlated spiked Wigner model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)&gt;1$, and succeeds for the correlated spiked Wishart model whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})&gt;1$. Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from ${X}$ alone or $y$ from ${Y}$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic results with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,1)&lt;1$ for the correlated spiked Wigner model and when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho,\tfrac{n}{N})&lt;1$ for the spiked Wishart model, all algorithms based on low-degree polynomials fails to distinguish $({X},{Y})$ with two independent noise matrices. This strongly suggests that $F=1$ is the precise computation threshold for our models.</description>

      <title>The fastest way through a traffic light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous solution of an optimisation problem of minimizing the expected delay caused by encountering a red traffic light on a road journey. The problem incorporates simple constraints on maximum speed, acceleration and braking rates, and depends on the assumed distribution of the remaining time until the traffic light will turn green, after it is first noticed. We assume that this distribution has a bounded and non-increasing density, which is natural since this holds for the law of the excess time in any stationary renewal process. In two special cases, where this distribution is either Uniform or Exponential, we give a complete characterisation of all possible combinations of phases of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, maximum braking, following an Euler--Lagrange curve, and standing stationary at the traffic light, which can make up an optimal solution. The key technique is to write the problem in terms of a two-dimensional pressure integral, so that the problem becomes analogous to filling a tank with a given quantity of liquid.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an acceleration corrected diffusion approximation of Langevin dynamics with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>
