      <title>Bounding the interleaving distance on concrete categories using a loss function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interleaving distance is arguably the most widely used metric in topological data analysis (TDA) due to its applicability to a wide array of inputs of interest, such as (multiparameter) persistence modules, Reeb graphs, merge trees, and zigzag modules. However, computation of the interleaving distance in the vast majority of this settings is known to be NP-hard, limiting its use in practical settings. Inspired by the work of Chambers et al. on the interleaving distance for mapper graphs, we solve a more general problem bounding the interleaving distance between generalized persistence modules on concrete categories via a loss function. This loss function measures how far an assignment, which can be thought of as an interleaving that might not commute, is from defining a true interleaving. We give settings for which the loss can be computed in polynomial time, including for certain assumptions on $k$-parameter persistence modules.</description>

      <title>A new model structure on dendroidal spaces for the theory of $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new model structure on the category of dendroidal spaces, designed to provide a further model for the homotopy theory of $\infty$-operads. This model is directly analogous to a recent construction on the category of simplicial spaces by Moser and Nuiten, and can be seen as its dendroidal counterpart. In our new model structure, the fibrant objects are the dendroidal Segal spaces, while the cofibrations form a subclass of those in the Segal space model structure. The weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely the Dwyer--Kan equivalences, and the fibrations between them are the isofibrations. We prove that this model structure is Quillen equivalent to the Cisinski--Moerdijk model structures on dendroidal sets and dendroidal spaces, thereby establishing a compatible extension of the theory of $\infty$-categories to the operadic setting.</description>

      <title>Definable functors and Brown--Adams representability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of when the derived category of a ring satisfies Brown--Adams representability is revisited via studying the transfer of pure homological dimension along definable functors: it is shown that, for any ring, the pure global dimension of the derived category is at least the pure global dimension of the ring; expanding results of Beligiannis and Keller-Christensen-Neeman. This result is obtained by constructing `change of category' isomorphisms of PExt groups across definable functors. The same isomorphisms illustrate circumstances when one can transfer the property of Brown--Adams representability. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to test whether certain derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves are a Brown category. We also make an investigation into the structure of derived categories of von Neumann regular rings, which are shown in many cases to control Brown--Adams representability; this includes a new proof of the telescope conjecture, and a new and short proof that a coherent ring satisfies Freyd's (strong) generating hypothesis if and only if it is von Neumann regular.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing span categories for profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major advantages of $\infty$-category theory over classical $1$-category theory is its robust and homotopically meaningful framework for taking (co)limits of diagrams of $\infty$-categories. However, it is both subtle and crucial to specify which variant of the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-categories is being used when forming such (co)limits. In this article, we present a concrete case study illustrating how (co)limits of $\infty$-categories behave in a specific setting. We demonstrate that the span category of a profinite group can be realised as the colimit of the span categories of its quotients by open normal subgroups and provide a number of applications to the world of equivariant (higher) algebra.</description>

      <title>Geometric obstructions for $\xi$-fillings of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the realisation problem for normal 1-types of 4-manifolds with a given boundary. More precisely, given a normal 1-type $\xi$ and closed 3-dimensional $\xi$-manifold $Y$, does there exist a compact 4-dimensional $\xi$-manifold with boundary $Y$? We describe a three stage obstruction theory for the existence of such a 4-manifold, with our main contribution being a `tertiary' obstruction that we describe geometrically via Wall's quadratic self-intersection form.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses algebro-topological techniques such as characteristic classes and obstruction theory, together with the $h$-principles for $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms recently established by the author and the $h$-principle for $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms established by Donaldson, to prove results on the topological properties of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on oriented 6- and 7-manifolds. Specifically, a criterion for an arbitrary oriented 7-manifold to admit a closed (resp. coclosed) $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structure is obtained, proving a conjecture of L\^{e}; a generalisation of Donaldson's '$\mathrm{G}_2$-cobordisms' to $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$, $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms is introduced, with homotopic $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms in a given cohomology class shown to be $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-cobordant, a result which currently has no analogue in the $\mathrm{G}_2$ case; and a complete classification of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ forms up to homotopy is provided. Additionally, a lower bound on the number of homotopy classes of closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms on a given manifold is obtained, and the question of which closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ forms arise as the boundary values of closed $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$-structures on oriented 7-manifolds is investigated.</description>

      <title>Equivariant cohomology of odd-dimensional complex quadrics from a combinatorial point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to determine the ring structure of the torus equivariant cohomology of odd-dimensional complex quadrics by computing the graph equivariant cohomology of their corresponding GKM graphs. We show that its graph equivariant cohomology is generated by three types of subgraphs in the GKM graph, which are subject to four different types of relations. Furthermore, we consider the relationship between the two graph equivariant cohomology rings induced by odd- and even-dimensional complex quadrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method for studying the pointed loop space of general polyhedral products, showing that many properties are determined by the moment-angle complex. To apply the method, we show that localised away from a finite set of primes, the loop space of a moment-angle complex is homotopy equivalent to a product of loops on spheres. As a consequence, we give p-local loop space decompositions of quasitoric manifolds, certain toric orbifolds and a wide family of polyhedral products. This verifies a conjecture of Anick for such spaces. We also describe the additive structure of loop homology of simply connected polyhedral products in terms of polynomials studied by Backelin and Berglund.</description>

      <title>Relative $h$-principles for closed stable forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration to develop a new, general method for proving relative $h$-principles for closed, stable, exterior forms on manifolds. This method is applied to prove the relative $h$-principle for 4 classes of closed stable forms which were previously not known to satisfy the $h$-principle, $\textit{viz.}$ stable $(2k-2)$-forms in $2k$ dimensions, stable $(2k-1)$-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms. The method is also used to produce new, unified proofs of all three previously established $h$-principles for closed, stable forms, $\textit{viz.}$ the $h$-principles for closed stable 2-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms and closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ 3-forms. In addition, it is shown that if a class of closed stable forms satisfies the relative $h$-principle, then the corresponding Hitchin functional (whenever defined) is necessarily unbounded above.
  Due to the general nature of the $h$-principles considered in this paper, the application of convex integration requires an analogue of Hodge decomposition on arbitrary $n$-manifolds (possibly non-compact, or with boundary) which cannot, to the author's knowledge, be found elsewhere in the literature. Such a decomposition is proven in Appendix A.</description>

      <title>The relative $h$-principle for closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration with avoidance and transversality arguments to prove the relative $h$-principle for closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms on oriented 6-manifolds. As corollaries, it is proven that if an oriented 6-manifold $\mathrm{M}$ admits any $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form, then every degree 3 cohomology class on $\mathrm{M}$ can be represented by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and, moreover, that the corresponding Hitchin functional on $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-forms representing this class is necessarily unbounded above. Essential to the proof of the $h$-principle is a careful analysis of the rank 3 distributions induced by an $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{R})^2$ 3-form and their interaction with generic pairs of hyperplanes. The proof also introduces a new property of sets in affine space, termed macilence, as a method of verifying ampleness.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild--Konstant--Rosenberg (HKR) theorem for arbitrary derived Deligne--Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case, although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not always coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, given a derived DM stack, the shifted tangent bundle of its orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to its free loop space. This yields a canonical HKR isomorphism of algebras between the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack and the cohomology of differential forms on its orbifold inertia stack. Moreover, this isomorphism intertwines the natural circle action and the de Rham differential. Similarly, HKR theorems for derived DM stacks are established for Hochschild cohomology, cyclic homology, negative cyclic homology, and periodic cyclic homology. As applications, we provide a rich supply of computations of Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology for interesting derived DM stacks, such as weighted projective lines, root stacks, quotients by algebraic groups, and mapping stacks, among others.</description>
