      <title>On General 2-dimensional Lattice Spectra: Closedness, Hall's Ray, and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrange and Markov spectra have been studied since late 19th century, concerning badly approximable real numbers. The Mordell-Gruber spectrum has been studied since 1936, concerning the supremum of the area of a rectangle centered at the origin that contains no other points of a unimodular lattice. We develop techniques that incorporate unimodular lattices and integer sequences, providing the log-systole function which unifies four famous spectra. We compute the Mordell-Gruber spectrum in the two-dimensional case and generalize Perron's formulas behind some famous spectra. Furthermore, we generalize the sum of Cantor sets to prove that certain functions on cartesian product of two Cantor sets contain an interval. Combining the techniques, we prove closedness and existence of Hall's interval in several different applications.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Identifiability in Kinetic Flux Profiling Models of Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolic fluxes are the rates of life-sustaining chemical reactions within a cell and metabolites are the components. Determining the changes in these fluxes is crucial to understanding diseases with metabolic causes and consequences. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) is a method for estimating flux that utilizes data from isotope tracing experiments. In these experiments, the isotope-labeled nutrient is metabolized through a pathway and integrated into the downstream metabolite pools. Measurements of proportion labeled for each metabolite in the pathway are taken at multiple time points and used to fit an ordinary differential equations model with fluxes as parameters. We begin by generalizing the process of converting diagrams of metabolic pathways into mathematical models composed of differential equations and algebraic constraints. The scaled differential equations for proportions of unlabeled metabolite contain parameters related to the metabolic fluxes in the pathway. We investigate flux parameter identifiability given data collected only at the steady state of the differential equation. Next, we give criteria for valid parameter estimations in the case of a large separation of timescales with fast-slow analysis. Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated data from KFP experiments containing both irreversible and reversible reactions illustrates the accuracy and reliability of flux estimations. These analyses provide constraints that serve as guidelines for the design of KFP experiments to estimate metabolic fluxes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative recurrence for Z-extension of three-dimensional Axiom A flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative recurrence properties in the case of $\mathbb{Z}$-extension of Axiom A flows on a Riemannian manifold. We study the asymptotic behavior of the first return time to a small neighborhood of the starting point. We establish results of almost everywhere convergence, and of convergence in distribution with respect to any probability measure absolutely continuous with respect to the infinite invariant measure. In particular, our results apply to geodesic flows on $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of compact smooth surfaces of negative curvature.</description>

      <title>The differential of self-consistent transfer operators and the local convergence to equilibrium of mean field strongly coupled dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09314v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the differential of a self-consistent transfer operator at a fixed point of the operator itself and show that its spectral properties can be used to establish a kind of local exponential convergence to equilibrium: probability measures near the fixed point converge exponentially fast to the fixed point by the iteration of the transfer operator. This holds also in the strong coupling case. We also show that for mean field coupled systems satisfying uniformly a Lasota-Yorke inequality also the differential does. We present examples of application of the general results to deterministic expanding maps outside the weak coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Prox-regular sweeping processes with bounded retraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand we prove that the Moreau's sweeping process driven by a uniformly prox-regular moving set with local bounded retraction has a unique solution provided that the coefficient of prox-regularity is larger than the size of any jump of the driving set. On the other hand we show how the case of local bounded retraction can be easily reduced to the $1$-Lipschitz continuous case: indeed we first solve the Lipschitz continuous case by means of the so called ``catching-up algorithm", and we reduce the local bounded retraction case to the Lipschitz one by using a reparametrization technique for functions with values in the family of prox-regular sets.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Convergence of Sequences of Singular Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the almost everywhere convergence of sequences of convolution operators given by probability measures $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb R$. If this sequence of operators constitutes an approximate identity on a particular class of functions $\mathcal F$, under what additional conditions do we have $\mu_n \ast f \to f$ a.e. for all $f \in \mathcal F$? We focus on the particular case of a sequence of contractions $C_{t_n}\mu$ of a single probability measure $\mu$, with $t_n \to 0$, so that that the sequence of operators is an approximate identity.</description>

      <title>Hidden subcriticality, symplectic structure, and universality of sharp arithmetic spectral results for type I operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of dual cocycles to develop several new concepts and tools for the study of one-frequency quasiperiodic operators with analytic potentials. As applications we solve two long-standing arithmetic conjectures: universality of sharp phase transition in frequency and absolute continuity of the integrated density of states for all frequencies for the entire class of (non-critical) type I operators, a large open set including the analytic neighborhood of several popular explicit models. Additionally, we prove the universality of $1/2$-H\"older continuity of the integrated density of states for all type I operators with Diophantine frequencies, partially solving You's conjecture \cite{You}.
  A key dynamical finding: the special symplectic structure of the center of the dual cocycle that, remarkably, holds also in the limit where the cocycle does not even exist, allows, among other things, to pass for the first time from trigonometric polynomials to general analytic potentials, in the duality-based arguments. It is also applicable in other outstanding problems where the results so far have only been obtained for the trigonometric polynomial case. The hidden subcriticality uncovered by this structure allows to define the rotation numbers for these complex-symplectic cocycles and reveals the dynamical nature of the special place of even potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-established that the spectral measure for one-frequency Schr\"odinger operators with Diophantine frequencies exhibits optimal $1/2$-H\"older continuity within the absolutely continuous spectrum. This study extends these findings by precisely characterizing the local distribution of the spectral measure for dense small potentials, including a notable result for any subcritical almost Mathieu operators. Additionally, we investigate the stratified H\"older continuity of the spectral measure at subcritical energies.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Continuous eigenfunctions of the transfer operator for Dyson models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we address a well-known problem at the intersection of ergodic theory and statistical mechanics. We prove that there exists a continuous eigenfunction for the transfer operator corresponding to pair potentials that satisfy a square summability condition, when the inverse temperature is subcritical. As a corollary we obtain a continuous eigenfunction for the classical Dyson model, with interactions $\J(k)=\beta \, k^{-\alpha}$, $k\ge1$, in the whole subcritical regime $\beta&lt;\beta_c$ for which the parameter $\alpha$ is greater than $3/2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of delayed complex balanced reaction networks with non-mass action kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider delayed chemical reaction networks with generalized kinetics of product form and show that complex balancing implies that within each positive stoichiometric compatibility class there is a unique positive equilibrium that is locally asymptotically stable relative to its class. The main tools of the proofs are respectively a version of the well-known classical logarithmic Lyapunov function applied to kinetic systems and its generalization to the delayed case as a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Finally, we demonstrate our results through illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Surfaces of genus $g\geq 1$ in 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider surfaces embedded in a 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifold and the problem of the finiteness of the induced distance (i.e., the infimum of the length of horizontal curves that belong to the surface). Recently it has been proved that for a surface having the topology of a sphere embedded in a tight co-orientable structure, the distance is always finite. In this paper we study closed surfaces of genus larger than 1, proving that such surfaces can be embedded in such a way that the induced distance is finite or infinite. We then study the structural stability of the finiteness/not-finiteness of the distance.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Normal Form and Growth of Sobolev Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16492v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a class of reducible Hamiltonian partial differential equations (PDEs) with arbitrary spatial dimensions, quantified by a quadratic polynomial with time-dependent coefficients, we present a comprehensive classification of long-term solution behaviors within Sobolev space. This classification is achieved through the utilization of Metaplectic and Schr\"odinger representations. Each pattern of Sobolev norm behavior corresponds to a specific $n-$dimensional symplectic normal form, as detailed in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
  When applied to periodically or quasi-periodically forced $n-$dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators, we identify novel growth rates for the $\mathcal{H}^s-$norm as $t$ tends to infinity, such as $t^{(n-1)s}e^{\lambda st}$ (with $\lambda&gt;0$) and $t^{(2n-1)s}+ \iota t^{2ns}$ (with $\iota\geq 0$). Notably, we demonstrate that stability in Sobolev space, defined as the boundedness of the Sobolev norm, is essentially a unique characteristic of one-dimensional scenarios, as outlined in Theorem 1.3.
  As a byproduct, we discover that the growth rate of the Sobolev norm for the quantum Hamiltonian can be directly described by that of the solution to the classical Hamiltonian which exhibits the ``fastest" growth, as articulated in Theorem 1.4.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Approximation of Fading Mode in Neurooscillator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of two delay differential equations with a large parameter, modeling the association of a pair of neurooscillators. The unknown functions describe the changes in the normalized membrane potentials of neurons over time, with the large parameter characterizing the speed of electrical processes. The first equation is separated from the system and represents a generalized Hutchinson equation. This equation, as known, possesses periodic solutions with high peaks over the period. The second equation is also based on the generalized Hutchinson equation, but with an additional term, linking it to an oscillator satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, it is possible to asymptotically construct the so-called fading neuron mode, which is as follows: for any natural number $n$, one can adjust the parameters of the problem in such a way that the solution is asymptotically close to a periodic function with high peaks over $n$ periods, and then, after a transient process represented by decreasing peaks, becomes asymptotically small.</description>
