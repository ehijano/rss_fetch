      <title>Model-Free Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO: A Channel Charting-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is fundamental to wireless communications, yet it becomes increasingly challenging in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems where base stations employ hundreds of antennas. Traditional least-squares methods require prohibitive pilot overhead that scales with antenna count, while sparse estimation methods depend on precise channel models that may not always be practical. This paper proposes a model-free approach combining deep autoencoders and LSTM networks. The method first learns low-dimensional channel representations preserving temporal correlation through augmenting a channel charting-inspired loss function, then tracks these features to recover full channel information from limited pilots. Simulation results using ray-tracing datasets show that the proposed approach achieves up to 9 dB improvement in normalized mean square error compared to the least-squares methods under ill-conditioned scenarios, while maintaining scalability across MIMO configurations.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Periodic Ambiguity Function of Random Communication Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the ambiguity function (AF) of communication signals carrying random data payloads, which is a fundamental metric characterizing sensing capability in ISAC systems. We first develop a unified analytical framework to evaluate the AF of communication-centric ISAC signals constructed from arbitrary orthonormal bases and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) constellation symbols. Subsequently, we derive the discrete periodic ambiguity function (DP-AF) and provide closed-form expressions for its expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) and average sidelobe level. Notably, we prove that the normalized EISL is invariant across all constellations and modulation bases. Finally, the theoretical findings are validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Based Radio Frequency Fingerprinting for GNSS Spoofing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of technology has led to an increase in the number of devices that rely on position, velocity, and time (PVT) information to perform their functions. As such, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have been adopted as one of the most promising solutions to provide PVT. Consequently, there are renewed efforts aimed at enhancing GNSS capabilities to meet emerging use cases and their requirements. For example, GNSS is evolving to rely on low-earth-orbit satellites, shifting the focus from traditional medium-earth-orbit satellites. Unfortunately, these developments also bring forth higher risks of interference signals such as spoofers, which pose serious security threats. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired solutions are being developed to overcome the limitations of conventional mathematics-based approaches, which have proven inflexible when dealing with diverse forms of interference. In this paper, we advance this direction by proposing a meta-learning framework that enables GNSS receivers to detect various types of spoofers. Specifically, our approach exploits the radio frequency fingerprints present in the signal at both the pre-correlation and post-correlation stages of the receiver. The proposed solution has superior generalization properties compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly detects spoofers of different forms, with spoofing detection accuracies of more than 95% on multiple datasets from the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT) and the Oak Ridge Spoofing and Interference Test Battery (OAKBAT) repositories</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Dataset for Indoor Radio Mapping with 3D Point Clouds and RSSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of smart devices supporting bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time video analytics, smart sensing, and Extended Reality (XR), necessitates reliable wireless connectivity in indoor environments. Therein, accurate estimation of Radio Environment Maps (REMs) enables adaptive wireless network planning and optimization of Access Point (AP) placement. However, generating realistic REMs remains challenging due to the complexity of indoor spaces. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces a multimodal dataset that integrates high-resolution 3D LiDAR scans with Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements collected under 20 distinct AP configurations in a multi-room indoor environment. The dataset captures two measurement scenarios: the first without human presence in the environment, and the second with human presence. Thus, the presented dataset supports the study of dynamic environmental effects on wireless signal propagation. This resource is designed to facilitate research in data-driven wireless modeling, particularly in the context of emerging high-frequency standards such as IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7), and aims to advance the development of robust, high-capacity indoor communication systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Time-Varying mmWave Channel Estimation: A Rank-Aware Matrix Completion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional channel estimation in fast time-varying millimeter-wave MIMO systems with a hybrid architecture. By exploiting the low-rank and sparsity properties of the channel matrix, we propose a two-phase compressed sensing framework consisting of observation matrix completion and channel matrix sparse recovery, respectively. First, we formulate the observation matrix completion problem as a low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) problem and develop a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm that enables the matrix and its rank to iteratively update. This approach achieves high-precision completion of the observation matrix and explicit rank estimation without prior knowledge. Second, we devise a rank-aware batch orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method for achieving low-latency sparse channel recovery. To handle abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, we establish a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model that leverages the temporal rank correlation between continuous-time instances to obtain a complete observation matrix capable of perceiving rank changes for more accurate channel estimates. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation frame and demonstrate that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art performance in low-rank matrix recovery with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Secure Communication in ISAC Systems with STAR-RIS and RSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for improving physical layer security (PLS) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Specifically, we consider a multi-user, multi-sensing target scenario, where each sensing target is treated as a potential eavesdropper, reflecting realistic deployment conditions. To enable fairness-aware secure communication among users while maintaining sensing performance, we formulate a joint optimization problem that designs the base station beamforming vectors and STAR-RIS coefficients, aiming to maximize the minimum secrecy rate under a minimum beampattern gain constraint. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and the majorization-minimization (MM) method. Simulation results verify the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate significant improvements in secure communication performance.</description>

      <title>Target Detection with Tightly-coupled Antennas: Analysis for Unknown Wideband Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents analysis for target detection using tightly-coupled antenna (TCA) arrays with high mutual coupling (MC). We show that the wide operational bandwidth of TCAs is advantageous for target detection. We assume a sensing receiver equipped with a TCA array that collects joint time and frequency samples of the target's echo signals. Echoes are assumed to be unknown wideband signals, and noise at the TCA array follows a frequency-varying correlation model due to MC. We also assume that the echo signals are time varying, with no assumption on the temporal variation. We consider three regimes in frequency as constant, slowly or rapidly varying, to capture all possible spectral dynamics of the echoes. We propose a novel detector for the slowly-varying regime, and derive detectors based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the other regimes. For the rapidly-varying regime, we derive an extended energy detector for correlated noise with frequency and time samples. We analyze the performance of all the detectors. We also derive and analyze an ideal detector giving an upper bound on performance. We validate our analysis with simulations and demonstrate that our proposed detector outperforms the MLE-based detectors in terms of robustness to frequency variation. Also, we highlight that TCA arrays offer clear advantages over weakly-coupled antenna arrays in target detection.</description>

      <title>Stacked Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Design for Multi-User Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00878v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as an effective solution for next-generation wireless networks. A SIM comprises multiple metasurface layers that enable signal processing directly in the wave domain. Moreover, recent advances in flexible metamaterials have highlighted the potential of flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs), which can be physically morphed to enhance communication performance. In this paper, we propose a stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM)-based communication system for the first time, where each metasurface layer is deformable to improve the system's performance. We first present the system model, including the transmit and receive signal models as well as the channel model, and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate under constraints on the transmit power budget, morphing distance, and the unit-modulus condition of the meta-atom responses. To solve this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFIM-based system achieves significant performance gains compared to its rigid SIM counterpart.</description>

      <title>Towards Channel Charting Enhancement with Non-Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how fully-passive electromagnetic skins (EMSs) can be engineered to enhance channel charting (CC) in dense urban environments. We employ two complementary state-of-the-art CC techniques, semi-supervised t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and a semi-supervised Autoencoder (AE), to verify the consistency of results across nonparametric and parametric mappings. We show that the accuracy of CC hinges on a balance between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial dissimilarity: EMS codebooks that only maximize gain, as in conventional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) optimization, suppress location fingerprints and degrade CC, while randomized phases increase diversity but reduce SNR. To address this trade-off, we design static EMS phase profiles via a quantile-driven criterion that targets worst-case users and improves both trustworthiness and continuity. In a 3D ray-traced city at 30 GHz, the proposed EMS reduces the 90th-percentile localization error from &gt; 50 m to &lt; 25 m for both t-SNE and AE-based CC, and decreases severe trajectory dropouts by over 4x under 15% supervision. The improvements hold consistently across the evaluated configurations, establishing static, pre-configured EMS as a practical enabler of CC without reconfiguration overheads.</description>

      <title>Lightweight ResNet-Based Deep Learning for Photoplethysmography Signal Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing application of deep learning in wearable devices, lightweight and efficient models are critical to address the computational constraints in resource-limited platforms. The performance of these approaches can be potentially improved by using various preprocessing methods. This study proposes a lightweight ResNet-based deep learning framework with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules for photoplethysmography (PPG) signal quality assessment (SQA) and compares different input configurations, including the PPG signal alone, its first derivative (FDP), its second derivative (SDP), the autocorrelation of PPG (ATC), and various combinations of these channels. Experimental evaluations on the Moore4Medical (M4M) and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate the model's performance, achieving up to 96.52% AUC on the M4M test dataset and up to 84.43% AUC on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The novel M4M dataset was collected to explore PPG-based monitoring for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) and AF burden in high-risk patients. Compared to the five reproduced existing studies, our models achieves over 99% reduction in parameters and more than 60% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for On-the-Edge Murmur Detection in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and reliable detection of heart murmurs is essential for the timely diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, yet traditional auscultation remains subjective and dependent on expert interpretation. This work investigates artificial intelligence (AI)-based murmur detection using the CirCor Heart Sound dataset, with a focus on enabling uncertainty-aware, resource-efficient deployment on edge devices. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures of increasing complexity (Light, Baseline, and Heavy) were compared in terms of classification performance, computational cost, and suitability for on-device inference. Additionally, Monte Carlo Dropout was applied for uncertainty estimation, providing confidence measures to improve prediction sensitivity. Results show that lightweight models can achieve accuracy comparable to deeper networks (91%) while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Incorporating uncertainty-based selective classification further improved sensitivity by 3%, enhancing robustness and clinical reliability. The findings highlight the feasibility of developing computationally efficient, uncertainty-aware AI systems for heart murmur screening in low-resource and remote healthcare settings.</description>

      <title>Seed-Induced Uniqueness in Transformer Models: Subspace Alignment Governs Subliminal Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze subliminal transfer in Transformer models, where a teacher embeds hidden traits that can be linearly decoded by a student without degrading main-task performance. Prior work often attributes transferability to global representational similarity, typically quantified with Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). Using synthetic corpora with disentangled public and private labels, we distill students under matched and independent random initializations. We find that transfer strength hinges on alignment within a trait-discriminative subspace: same-seed students inherit this alignment and show higher leakage {\tau \approx} 0.24, whereas different-seed students -- despite global CKA &gt; 0.9 -- exhibit substantially reduced excess accuracy {\tau \approx} 0.12 - 0.13. We formalize this with subspace-level CKA diagnostic and residualized probes, showing that leakage tracks alignment within the trait-discriminative subspace rather than global representational similarity. Security controls (projection penalty, adversarial reversal, right-for-the-wrong-reasons regularization) reduce leakage in same-base models without impairing public-task fidelity. These results establish seed-induced uniqueness as a resilience property and argue for subspace-aware diagnostics for secure multi-model deployments.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Using Pinching Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pinching-Antenna System (PASS) reconfigures wireless channels through \emph{pinching beamforming}, in which the active positions of pinching antennas (PAs) along dielectric waveguides are optimized to shape the radiation pattern. This article investigates the performance of PASS-enabled tri-hybrid beamforming, where pinched waveguides are integrated with a hybrid digital-analog beamformer to mitigate path loss and enhance spectral efficiency. The channel capacity of the proposed system is characterized by deriving the optimal tri-hybrid beamformer at both the digital and analog domains, as well as the optimal placement of PAs. Closed-form upper and lower bounds of the channel capacity are obtained, leading to a capacity scaling law with respect to the number of PAs. Numerical results verify the tightness of the derived bounds and demonstrate that applying PASS to tri-hybrid beamforming yields a significant performance gain over conventional hybrid beamforming under the same number of radio-frequency chains.</description>

      <title>Hi-WaveTST: A Hybrid High-Frequency Wavelet-Transformer for Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become state-of-the-art (SOTA) for time-series classification, with models like PatchTST demonstrating exceptional performance. These models rely on patching the time series and learning relationships between raw temporal data blocks. We argue that this approach is blind to critical, non-obvious high-frequency information that is complementary to the temporal dynamics. In this letter, we propose Hi-WaveTST, a novel Hybrid architecture that augments the original temporal patch with a learnable, High-Frequency wavelet feature stream. Our wavelet stream uses a deep Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) on each patch and extracts features using a learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer. On the UCI-HAR benchmark dataset, our hybrid model achieves a mean accuracy of 93.38 percent plus-minus 0.0043, significantly outperforming the SOTA PatchTST baseline (92.59 percent plus-minus 0.0039). A comprehensive ablation study proves that every component of our design-the hybrid architecture, the deep high-frequency wavelet decomposition, and the learnable GeM pooling-is essential for this state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Classification of motor faults based on transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient of omni-directional antenna using DCNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most commonly used electrical rotary machines in the field are induction machines. In this paper, we propose an antenna based approach for the classification of motor faults in induction motors using the reflection coefficient S11 and the transmission coefficient S21 of the antenna. The spectrograms of S11 and S21 are seen to possess unique signatures for various fault conditions that are used for the classification. To learn the required characteristics and classification boundaries, deep convolution neural network (DCNN) is applied to the spectrogram of the S-parameter. DCNN has been found to reach classification accuracy 93% using S11, 98.1% using S21 and 100% using both S11 and S21. The effect of antenna operating frequency, its location and duration of signal on the classification accuracy is also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>CRMD: Complex Robust Modal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to real-valued signals, complex-valued signals provide a unique and intuitive representation of the phase of real physical systems and processes, which holds fundamental significance and is widely applied across many fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a robust modal decomposition (RMD) in the complex domain as a natural and general extension of the original real-valued RMD. We revisit and derive the mathematical principles of RMD in the complex domain, and develop an algorithmic version tailored for this domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic simulation datasets and real-world datasets from diverse fields, including a millimeter-wave radar physiological signal detection dataset, a faulty bearing dataset, a radio-frequency unmanned aerial vehicle identification dataset, and a WiFi CSI-based respiration detection dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed complex-domain robust modal decomposition significantly improves performance across these various applications.</description>

      <title>MM-2FSK: Multimodal Frequency Shift Keying for Ultra-Efficient and Robust High-Resolution MIMO Radar Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01405v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of static and rapidly moving targets demands three-dimensional imaging solutions with high temporal and spatial resolution. Radar sensors are a promising sensing modality because of their fast capture rates and their independence from lighting conditions. To achieve high spatial resolution, MIMO radars with large apertures are required. Yet, they are infrequently used for dynamic scenarios due to significant limitations in signal processing algorithms. These limitations impose substantial hardware constraints due to their computational intensity and reliance on large signal bandwidths, ultimately restricting the sensor's capture rate.
  One solution of previous work is to use few frequencies only, which enables faster capture and requires less computation; however, this requires coarse knowledge of the target's position and works in a limited depth range only. To address these challenges, we extend previous work into the multimodal domain with MM-2FSK, which leverages an assistive optical depth sensing modality to obtain a depth prior, enabling high framerate capture with only few frequencies.
  We evaluate our method using various target objects with known ground truth geometry that is spatially registered to real millimeter-wave MIMO radar measurements. Our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of depth quality, being able to compete with the time- and resource-intensive measurements with many frequencies.</description>

      <title>AoI-Aware Machine Learning for Constrained Multimodal Sensing-Aided Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using environmental sensory data can enhance communications beam training and reduce its overhead compared to conventional methods. However, the availability of fresh sensory data during inference may be limited due to sensing constraints or sensor failures, necessitating a realistic model for multimodal sensing. This paper proposes a joint multimodal sensing and beam prediction framework that operates under a constraint on the average sensing rate, i.e., how often fresh sensory data should be obtained. The proposed method combines deep reinforcement learning, i.e., a deep Q-network (DQN), with a neural network (NN)-based beam predictor. The DQN determines the sensing decisions, while the NN predicts the best beam from the codebook. To capture the effect of limited fresh data during inference, the age of information (AoI) is incorporated into the training of both the DQN and the beam predictor. Lyapunov optimization is employed to design a reward function that enforces the average sensing constraint. Simulation results on a real-world dataset show that AoI-aware training improves top-1 and top-3 inference accuracy by 44.16% and 52.96%, respectively, under a strict sensing constraint. The performance gain, however, diminishes as the sensing constraint is relaxed.</description>

      <title>Robust Radar Mounting Angle Estimation in Operational Driving Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robust estimation of the mounting angle for millimeter-wave automotive radars installed on moving vehicles is investigated. We propose a novel signal processing pipeline that combines radar and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to achieve accurate and reliable performance in realistic driving scenarios. Unlike previous studies, the method employs neural networks to process sparse and noisy radar measurements, reject detections from moving objects, and estimate radar motion. In addition, a measurement model is introduced to correct IMU bias and scale factor errors. Using vehicle kinematics, the radar mounting angle is then computed from the estimated radar motion and the vehicle's yaw rate. To benchmark performance, the proposed approach is comprehensively compared with two problem formulations and four estimation techniques reported in the literature. Validation is carried out on the challenging RadarScenes dataset, covering over 79 km of real-world driving. Results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, with reliable estimates obtained within approximately 25 seconds of driving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that automotive radar mounting angles can be accurately estimated in complex, real traffic conditions, without requiring controlled environments, dedicated targets, or specially designed driving routes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Movable Antenna Position and Transmissive RIS Phase for Efficient Base Station Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) and transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (TRIS) represent two innovative technologies that significantly enhance the flexibility of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact base station architecture that synergistically integrates a movable antenna with a transmissive RIS in the near field, enabling joint optimization of antenna positioning and TRIS phase adjustments. The proposed model compensates for phase quantization loss and significantly enhances signal strength, even with low-resolution (1-2 bit) phase shifters. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluate system performance as a function of TRIS size and antenna placement. Our results indicate that antenna mobility provides an additional degree of freedom to enhance the desired signal and achieve a higher SNR, particularly when combined with TRIS capabilities. These findings demonstrate that MA-TRIS integration offers a cost-effective and energy-efficient pathway toward compact 6G base stations, combining hardware simplicity with strong performance gains.</description>

      <title>Clutter Suppression in Bistatic ISAC with Joint Angle and Doppler Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of radar and communications in wireless systems marks a paradigm shift for the sixth-generation (6G) networks. As 6G systems are expected to operate at higher frequencies and employ larger antenna arrays than fifth-generation (5G) systems, they can also enable more accurate sensing capabilities. To this end, the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm aims to unify the physical and radio frequency (RF) domains by introducing the sensing functionality into the communication network. However, the clutter poses a challenge, as it can significantly degrade the sensing accuracy in ISAC systems. This paper presents a novel two-dimensional root multiple signal classification (2D-rootMUSIC)-based algorithm for static background clutter suppression. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the strong background clutter, yields accurate parameter estimation performance, and offers a notable improvement in the signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio (SCNR), while outperforming the prior-art benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>AnyPPG: An ECG-Guided PPG Foundation Model Trained on Over 100,000 Hours of Recordings for Holistic Health Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers a noninvasive and accessible modality for health monitoring beyond clinical settings. However, existing studies are limited by the scale and diversity of labeled data, constraining model accuracy, generalizability, and the exploration of broader applications. This study investigates the potential of PPG for holistic health profiling through the integration of foundation model techniques.
  Methods: We present AnyPPG, a PPG foundation model pretrained on large-scale, multi-source synchronized PPG-ECG data. By aligning PPG and ECG representations within a shared space, AnyPPG learns physiologically meaningful features from unlabeled signals. Its capability was further evaluated across a diverse set of downstream tasks, encompassing both conventional physiological analysis and comprehensive multi-organ disease diagnosis.
  Results: Across eleven physiological analysis tasks spanning six independent datasets, AnyPPG achieved state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of 12.8% in regression and 9.1% in classification tasks over the next-best model. In multi-organ disease diagnosis, AnyPPG demonstrated broad cross-system diagnostic potential. Among 1,014 ICD-10 three-digit disease categories, 13 achieved an AUC above 0.8 and 137 exceeded 0.7. Beyond strong performance in cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, valvular disorders, and hypertension, AnyPPG also showed substantial diagnostic value for non-cardiovascular conditions, exemplified by Parkinson's disease (AUC = 0.78) and chronic kidney disease (AUC = 0.74).
  Conclusions: AnyPPG demonstrates that a PPG foundation model trained through physiological alignment with ECG can produce accurate and robust signal representations. Building on this capability, it underscores the potential of PPG as a modality for comprehensive assessment of systemic and multi-organ health.</description>

      <title>On Systematic Performance of 3-D Holographic MIMO: Clarke, Kronecker, and 3GPP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has emerged as a key enabler for 6G networks, yet conventional planar implementations suffer from spatial correlation and mutual coupling at sub-wavelength spacing, which fundamentally limit the effective degrees of freedom (EDOF) and channel capacity. Three-dimensional (3-D) holographic MIMO offers a pathway to overcome these constraints by exploiting volumetric array configurations that enlarge the effective aperture and unlock additional spatial modes. This work presents the first systematic evaluation that jointly incorporates electromagnetic (EM) characteristics, such as mutual coupling and radiation efficiency, into the analysis of 3-D arrays under Clarke, Kronecker, and standardized 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) channel models. Analytical derivations and full-wave simulations demonstrate that 3-D architectures achieve higher EDOF, narrower beamwidths, and notable capacity improvements compared with planar baselines. In 3GPP urban macro channels with horizontal element spacing of 0.3 lambda, 3-D configurations yield approximately 20% capacity improvement over conventional 2-D arrays, confirming the robustness and scalability of volumetric designs under realistic conditions. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical feasibility and practical deployment, offering design guidance for next-generation 6G base station arrays.</description>

      <title>Practical Approaches to Quantifying Intra-Pair Skew Impact via Insertion Loss Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in AI workloads and escalating data center requirements have created demand for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of intra-pair skew can significantly degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. To quantify the impact of intra-pair skew, conventional time-domain methods are often unreliable for coupled interconnects due to skew variations across voltage levels, while frequency-domain approaches frequently fail to address reciprocity and symmetry issues. This can result in channels that meet skew specifications in one direction but not the other, despite the inherently reciprocal nature of skew impact. To address these limitations, we introduce two new reciprocal parameters for quantifying intra-pair skew effects: Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM SILD). Measurements conducted using 224 Gb/s SerDes IP and a variety of channels with different intra-pair skews demonstrate a strong correlation between FOM SILD and bit error rate (BER). Results show that when FOM SILD is below 0.2-0.3 dB, BER remains stable, indicating minimal signal integrity degradation; however, BER increases noticeably as FOM SILD exceeds 0.3 dB. Statistical analysis across more than 3,000 high-speed twinax cables reveals that the majority exhibit FOM SILD values less than 0.1 dB, underscoring the practical relevance of the proposed metrics for high-speed interconnect assessment.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction and Unsupervised Clustering for Parity Detection: A Feature Engineering Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even -- by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering. Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers, achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques, originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides an illustrative perspective on how feature engineering and clustering may be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, potentially bridging symbolic reasoning and feature-based learning.</description>

      <title>A generative adversarial network optimization method for damage detection and digital twinning by deep AI fault learning: Z24 Bridge structural health monitoring benchmark validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization-based damage detection and damage state digital twinning capabilities are examined here of a novel conditional-labeled generative adversarial network methodology. The framework outperforms current approaches for fault anomaly detection as no prior information is required for the health state of the system: a topic of high significance for real-world applications. Specifically, current artificial intelligence-based digital twinning approaches suffer from the uncertainty related to obtaining poor predictions when a low number of measurements is available, physics knowledge is missing, or when the damage state is unknown. To this end, an unsupervised framework is examined and validated rigorously on the benchmark structural health monitoring measurements of Z24 Bridge: a post-tensioned concrete highway bridge in Switzerland. In implementing the approach, firstly, different same damage-level measurements are used as inputs, while the model is forced to converge conditionally to two different damage states. Secondly, the process is repeated for a different group of measurements. Finally, the convergence scores are compared to identify which one belongs to a different damage state. The process for both healthy-to-healthy and damage-to-healthy input data creates, simultaneously, measurements for digital twinning purposes at different damage states, capable of pattern recognition and machine learning data generation. Further to this process, a support vector machine classifier and a principal component analysis procedure is developed to assess the generated and real measurements of each damage category, serving as a secondary new dynamics learning indicator in damage scenarios. Importantly, the approach is shown to capture accurately damage over healthy measurements, providing a powerful tool for vibration-based system-level monitoring and scalable infrastructure resilience.</description>

      <title>Deep recurrent-convolutional neural network learning and physics Kalman filtering comparison in dynamic load identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic structural load identification capabilities of the gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks are examined herein. The examination is on realistic small dataset training conditions and on a comparative view to the physics-based residual Kalman filter (RKF). The dynamic load identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining poor predictions when in civil engineering applications only a low number of tests are performed or are available, or when the structural model is unidentifiable. In considering the methods, first, a simulated structure is investigated under a shaker excitation at the top floor. Second, a building in California is investigated under seismic base excitation, which results in loading for all degrees of freedom. Finally, the International Association for Structural Control-American Society of Civil Engineers (IASC-ASCE) structural health monitoring benchmark problem is examined for impact and instant loading conditions. Importantly, the methods are shown to outperform each other on different loading scenarios, while the RKF is shown to outperform the networks in physically parametrized identifiable cases.</description>

      <title>MeixnerNet: Adaptive and Robust Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Discrete Orthogonal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results by defining graph convolutions in the spectral domain. A common approach, popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings.
  In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm.
  We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile, collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.</description>

      <title>Casing Collar Identification using AlexNet-based Neural Networks for Depth Measurement in Oil and Gas Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network-based CCL signal recognition has achieved significant progress in collar identification, preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover, the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper presents a system integrated into downhole tools for CCL signal acquisition to facilitate dataset construction. We propose comprehensive preprocessing methods for data augmentation and evaluate their effectiveness using our AlexNet-based neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across various configuration combinations, we analyze the contribution of each augmentation method. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing (LDS), and random cropping are fundamental requirements for model training, while label smoothing regularization (LSR), time scaling, and multiple sampling significantly enhance model generalization capability. The F1 scores of our two benchmark models trained with the proposed augmentation methods maximumly improve from 0.937 and 0.952 to 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. Performance validation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach. This work addresses the gaps in data augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models in CCL data-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Fluid Antenna-Assisted Non-Terrestrial Networks in 6G and Beyond: Fundamentals, State of the Art, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the surging demand for ultra-reliable, low-latency, and ubiquitous connectivity in Sixth-Generation (6G) networks, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) emerge as a key complement to terrestrial networks by offering flexible access and global coverage. Despite the significant potential, NTNs still face critical challenges, including dynamic propagation environments, energy constraints, and dense interference. As a key 6G technology, Fluid Antennas (FAs) can reshape wireless channels by reconfiguring radiating elements within a limited space, such as their positions and rotations, to provide higher channel diversity and multiplexing gains. Compared to fixed-position antennas, FAs can present a promising integration path for NTNs to mitigate dynamic channel fading and optimize resource allocation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of FA-assisted NTNs. We begin with a brief overview of the classical structure and limitations of existing NTNs, the fundamentals and advantages of FAs, and the basic principles of FA-assisted NTNs. We then investigate the joint optimization solutions, detailing the adjustments of FA configurations, NTN platform motion modes, and resource allocations. We also discuss the combination with other emerging technologies and explore FA-assisted NTNs as a novel network architecture for intelligent function integrations. Furthermore, we delve into the physical layer security and covert communication in FA-assisted NTNs. Finally, we highlight the potential future directions to empower broader applications of FA-assisted NTNs.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Plug-and-Play MCMC Algorithm for High-Dimensional Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are standard approaches to solve imaging inverse problems and quantify estimation uncertainties, a key requirement in absence of ground-truth data. To improve estimation quality, Plug-and-Play MCMC algorithms, such as PnP-ULA, have been recently developed to accommodate priors encoded by a denoising neural network. Designing scalable samplers for high-dimensional imaging inverse problems remains a challenge: drawing and storing high-dimensional samples can be prohibitive, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, this work proposes a distributed sampler based on approximate data augmentation and PnP-ULA to solve very large problems. The proposed sampler uses lightweight denoising convolutional neural network, to efficiently exploit multiple GPUs on a Single Program Multiple Data architecture. Reconstruction performance and scalability are evaluated on several imaging problems. Communication and computation overheads due to the denoiser are carefully discussed. The proposed distributed approach noticeably combines three very precious qualities: it is scalable, enables uncertainty quantification, for a reconstruction performance comparable to other PnP methods.</description>

      <title>Keys in the Weights: Transformer Authentication Using Model-Bound Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Model-Bound Latent Exchange (MoBLE), a decoder-binding property in Transformer autoencoders formalized as Zero-Shot Decoder Non-Transferability (ZSDN). In identity tasks using iso-architectural models trained on identical data but differing in seeds, self-decoding achieves more than 0.91 exact match and 0.98 token accuracy, while zero-shot cross-decoding collapses to chance without exact matches. This separation arises without injected secrets or adversarial training, and is corroborated by weight-space distances and attention-divergence diagnostics. We interpret ZSDN as model binding, a latent-based authentication and access-control mechanism, even when the architecture and training recipe are public: encoder's hidden state representation deterministically reveals the plaintext, yet only the correctly keyed decoder reproduces it in zero-shot. We formally define ZSDN, a decoder-binding advantage metric, and outline deployment considerations for secure artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines. Finally, we discuss learnability risks (e.g., adapter alignment) and outline mitigations. MoBLE offers a lightweight, accelerator-friendly approach to secure AI deployment in safety-critical domains, including aviation and cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Adapt under Attack and Domain Shift: Unified Adversarial Meta-Learning and Domain Adaptation for Robust Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a leading approach for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, vulnerability to adversarial attacks and susceptibility to data distribution shifts hinder their practical deployment in real-world, dynamic environments. To address these threats, we propose a novel, unified framework that integrates meta-learning with domain adaptation, making AMC systems resistant to both adversarial attacks and environmental changes. Our framework utilizes a two-phase strategy. First, in an offline phase, we employ a meta-learning approach to train the model on clean and adversarially perturbed samples from a single source domain. This method enables the model to generalize its defense, making it resistant to a combination of previously unseen attacks. Subsequently, in the online phase, we apply domain adaptation to align the model's features with a new target domain, allowing it to adapt without requiring substantial labeled data. As a result, our framework achieves a significant improvement in modulation classification accuracy against these combined threats, offering a critical solution to the deployment and operational challenges of modern AMC systems.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Model-Enabled Scenario-Specific Neural Receivers for Superimposed Pilot Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural receivers have demonstrated strong performance in wireless communication systems. However, their effectiveness typically depends on access to large-scale, scenario-specific channel data for training, which is often difficult to obtain in practice. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion models (DMs), have emerged as effective tools for synthesizing high-dimensional data. This paper presents a scenario-specific channel generation method based on conditional DMs, which accurately model channel distributions conditioned on user location and velocity information. The generated synthetic channel data are then employed for data augmentation to improve the training of a neural receiver designed for superimposed pilot-based transmission. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates high-fidelity channel samples and significantly enhances neural receiver performance in the target scenarios, outperforming conventional data augmentation and generative adversarial network-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Numerically Efficient and Stable Algorithms for Kernel-Based Regularized System Identification Using Givens-Vector Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerically efficient and stable algorithms are essential for kernel-based regularized system identification. The state of art algorithms exploit the semiseparable structure of the kernel and are based on the generator representation of the kernel matrix. However, as will be shown from both the theory and the practice, the algorithms based on the generator representation are sometimes numerically unstable, which limits their application in practice. This paper aims to address this issue by deriving and exploiting an alternative Givens-vector representation of some widely used kernel matrices. Based on the Givens-vector representation, we derive algorithms that yield more accurate results than existing algorithms without sacrificing efficiency. We demonstrate their usage for the kernel-based regularized system identification. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithms admit the same order of computational complexity as the state-of-the-art ones based on generator representation, but without issues with numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Large Language Model Inference via Resource-Aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01695v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for on-device large language model (LLM) inference highlights the need for efficient mobile edge computing (MEC) solutions, especially in resource-constrained settings. Speculative decoding offers a promising solution by partitioning token generation between a lightweight draft model on mobile devices and a powerful target model on edge servers, but suffers from communication overhead and asynchronous delays. This paper is the first to propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes user association and resource allocation (UARA) to support efficient parallel speculative decoding. We solve the UARA problem using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. To evaluate our approach under realistic conditions, we conduct experiments using the Sionna simulator. Results show that our method achieves up to 28.0% and an average of 23.7% reduction in end-to-end latency without compromising inference accuracy, enabling scalable and low-latency LLM services in MEC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes passive WiFi indoor localization. Instead of using WiFi signals received by mobile devices as fingerprints, we use signals received by routers to locate the mobile carrier. Consequently, software installation on the mobile device is not required. To resolve the data insufficiency problem, flow control signals such as request to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS) are utilized. In our model, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) are used as fingerprints for several algorithms, including deterministic, probabilistic and neural networks localization algorithms. We further investigated localization algorithms performance through extensive on-site experiments with various models of phones at hundreds of testing locations. We demonstrate that our passive scheme achieves an average localization error of 0.8 m when the phone is actively transmitting data frames and 1.5 m when it is not transmitting data frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel over-the-air computation (AirComp) framework empowered by movable antennas (MAs) is proposed to significantly enhance computation accuracy. Within this framework, the joint optimization of transmit power control, antenna positioning, and receive beamforming is investigated. Two design strategies are developed: (i) a dynamic design, where MA positions are optimized based on fast-varying instantaneous channel state information (CSI); and (ii) a static design, where antenna positions are optimized using only slow-varying statistical CSI. Numerical results validate the superior MSE performance of the proposed MA-enabled AirComp framework and demonstrate its clear advantage over benchmark systems employing conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs).</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feasibility of the promising large intelligent surface (LIS) concept, as well as its scalability, relies on the use of low-cost hardware components, raising concerns about the effects of hardware distortion. We analyze LIS systems with receive-chain (RX-chain) hardware distortion, showing how it may limit performance gains when scaling up these systems. In particular, using the memory-less polynomial model, analytical expressions are derived for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC). We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. The cost of assuming ideal hardware is further analyzed by quantifying the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with non-ideal hardware. The analytical expressions derived in this work are also used to propose practical antenna selection schemes for LIS, and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly leading to increased energy efficiency. Specifically, by turning off RX-chains with lower contribution to the post-MRC SNDR, we can reduce the energy consumption while maintaining performance. We also consider a more practical scenario where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

      <title>AsyMov: Integrated Sensing and Communications with Asynchronous Moving Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the device velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating minimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for enhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory (Cram\'er-Rao bound), simulation, and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups in the 60 GHz and 28 GHz bands, including moving human subjects. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against state-of-the-art methods and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Waveform Channel Modeling for Wideband Optical Fiber Transmission: Model Comparisons, Challenges and Potential Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate waveform simulation is critical for understanding fiber channel characteristics, developing digital signal processing (DSP) technologies, optimizing optical network configurations, and advancing the optical fiber transmission system towards wideband. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for waveform modeling, offering high accuracy and low complexity compared to traditional split-step Fourier method (SSFM), due to its strong nonlinear fitting capabilities and efficient parallel computation. However, most DL methods are designed for few-channel and low-rate WDM systems, leaving their scalability to wideband systems uncertain. Moreover, the lack of a standardized accuracy evaluation method and the inconsistent results between waveform errors and transmission performance errors, hinders fair comparisons of various DL schemes. In this paper, we introduce a DSP-assisted accuracy evaluation method integrated with nonlinear DSP, providing a fair benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of DL models. Using this method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DL schemes, ranging from simple configurations to more complex wideband setups. The feature decoupled distributed method combining with bidirectional long short-term memory achieves the better performance compared to other DL schemes. Furthermore, in scenarios with more-channel and higher-rate, the performance advantages of FDD-BiLSTM will be further improved. However, as the number of channels and symbol rates increase, the performance of FDD-BiLSTM still gradually deteriorate. We analyze these challenges from three perspectives: the more intricate linear and nonlinear effects, the higher sampling rate required for SSFM. To address these challenges, we discuss potential solutions from two aspects: incorporating more prior physical knowledge and optimizing the structure of DL models.</description>

      <title>An Active Dry-Contact Continuous EEG Monitoring System for Seizure Detection Applications in Clinical Neurophysiology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Young children and infants, especially newborns, are highly susceptible to seizures, which, if undetected and untreated, can lead to severe long-term neurological consequences. Early detection typically requires continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring in hospital settings, involving costly equipment and highly trained specialists. This study presents a low-cost, active dry-contact electrode-based, adjustable electroencephalography (EEG) headset, combined with an explainable deep learning model for seizure detection from reduced-montage EEG, and a multimodal artifact removal algorithm to enhance signal quality. Methods: EEG signals were acquired via active electrodes and processed through a custom-designed analog front end for filtering and digitization. The adjustable headset was fabricated using three-dimensional printing and laser cutting to accommodate varying head sizes. The deep learning model was trained to detect neonatal seizures in real time, and a dedicated multimodal algorithm was implemented for artifact removal while preserving seizure-relevant information. System performance was evaluated in a representative clinical setting on a pediatric patient with absence seizures, with simultaneous recordings obtained from the proposed device and a commercial wet-electrode cEEG system for comparison. Results: Signals from the proposed system exhibited a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.8 with those from the commercial device. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis indicated noise mitigation performance comparable to the commercial system. The deep learning model achieved accuracy and recall improvements of 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, over state-of-the-art approaches. The artifact removal algorithm effectively identified and eliminated noise while preserving seizure-related EEG features.</description>

Abstract: The Continuous Boostlet Transform (CBT) is introduced as a powerful tool for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, particularly acoustic wavefields. Overcoming the limitations of classical wavelets, the CBT leverages the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations to capture sparse features of natural acoustic fields. This paper presents the mathematical framework of the CBT, including its definition, fundamental properties, and associated uncertainty principles, such as Heisenberg's, logarithmic, Pitt's, and Nazarov's inequalities. These results illuminate the trade-offs between time and frequency localization in the boostlet domain. Practical examples with constant and exponential functions highlight the CBT's adaptability. With applications in radar, communications, audio processing, and seismic analysis, the CBT offers flexible time-frequency resolution, making it ideal for non-stationary and transient signals, and a valuable tool for modern signal processing.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted IRS (UMI) in the Presence of Hovering Fluctuations: 3D Pattern Characterization and Performance Analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to leverage the benefits of this technology for future communication networks, such as 6G. Key advantages include enhanced spectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible deployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI) technology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this challenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active elements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles, considering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The relationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking into account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form distribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear approximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit theorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance of UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should utilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As a result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS systems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in UAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the optimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.</description>

      <title>KAN-HAR: A Human activity recognition based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a critical role in numerous applications, including healthcare monitoring, fitness tracking, and smart environments. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches, while effective, often require extensive parameter tuning and may lack interpretability. In this work, we investigate the use of a single three-axis accelerometer and the Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (KAN) for HAR tasks, leveraging its ability to model complex nonlinear relationships with improved interpretability and parameter efficiency. The MotionSense dataset, containing smartphone-based motion sensor signals across various physical activities, is employed to evaluate the proposed approach. Our methodology involves preprocessing and normalization of accelerometer and gyroscope data, followed by KAN-based feature learning and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the KAN achieves competitive or superior classification performance compared to conventional deep neural networks, while maintaining a significantly reduced parameter count. This highlights the potential of KAN architectures as an efficient and interpretable alternative for real-world HAR systems. The open-source implementation of the proposed framework is available at the Project's GitHub Repository.</description>

      <title>RadarPLM: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection with Preference-aware Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities in capturing universal knowledge, making them promising applications for radar signal processing. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning PLMs on radar signals is both computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, particularly in low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) environments. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework for PLM-based marine radar target detection. First, we design a lightweight adaptation module, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning while preserving the pretrained model's general knowledge. Second, a novel preference-aware loss is developed to selectively optimize different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, guiding the model to concentrate on the most generalizable feature patterns during optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets demonstrate that the proposed finetuning framework achieves an average performance improvement of 9.9% over the standard approach under low SCR conditions. Furthermore, the fine-tuned model, RadarPLM, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, particularly when training data are limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a promising candidate measure for the assessment and optimization of localization systems, as it captures nonlinear dependencies between random variables. However, the high cost of computing MI, especially for high-dimensional problems, prohibits its application for many real-world localization systems. We evaluate an algorithm from a new class of neural MI estimators called Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to approximate the MI between the set of feasible user element (UE) locations and the corresponding set of measurements from said UE locations used for positioning. We apply this estimator to a simulated multilateration (MLAT) system, where the true MI for benchmarking can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. The estimator is experimentally evaluated w.r.t. its convergence and consistency and we investigate the usefulness of MI for assessing simple MLAT systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Based Framework for Passive Intermodulation Cancellation in MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>AI Signal Processing Paradigm for Movable Antenna: From Spatial Position Optimization to Electromagnetic Reconfigurability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) have become increasingly prominent. As a remedy, spatially movable antenna (SMA) and electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) have respectively emerged as key technologies to break through this bottleneck. SMA activates spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the electromagnetic domain. However, the ``spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this issue, we integrate the spatial optimization of SMA and the electromagnetic reconfiguration of ERA, propose a unified modeling framework termed movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA) and investigate the channel modeling and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for MARA. Besides, we systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems. This paper fills the gap in existing literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal processing paradigm under spatial-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and provides theoretical guidance for the design and optimization of 6G wireless systems with advanced MARA.</description>

      <title>Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning</title>

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev\.minimum, Elev\.L3, lev\.MAD\.mode, Elev\.mode, Elev\.MAD\.median, and Elev\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.</description>

      <title>Spherical Point Process with Random Heights: New Approach for Modeling and Analysis of Downlink Satellite Networks</title>

Abstract: The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite industry is undergoing rapid expansion, with operators competitively launching satellites due to the first-come, first-served principle governing orbital rights. This has led to the formation of increasingly large-scale, volumetric constellation where satellites operate across a diverse range of altitudes. To address the need for analyzing such complex networks, this paper establishes a new analytical framework for LEO constellations by leveraging a 3D Poisson point process (PPP). Specifically, we introduce a random height model (RHM) that can capture various altitude distributions by applying a random radial displacement to points generated by a homogeneous PPP on a nominal shell. Building on this, we derive an analytical expression for the downlink coverage probability. To motivate our model, we show that the altitude distributions of several leading satellite constellations, including Starlink, align with our model's assumptions. We then demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations that the coverage probability of our RHM closely matches that of these real-world networks. Finally, we confirm the accuracy of our analytical expressions by showing their agreement with simulation results. Our work thereby provides a powerful tool for understanding and predict how the statistical distribution of satellite altitudes impacts network performance.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Learning via Regularization, Confidence Minimization, and Selective Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Stable Super-Resolution: Model-Based Formulation and Stability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In mathematics, a super-resolution problem can be formulated as acquiring high-frequency data from low-frequency measurements. This extrapolation problem in the frequency domain is well-known to be unstable. We propose a model-based super-resolution framework (Model-SR) for solving the super-resolution problem and analyzing its stability, aiming to narrow the gap between limited theory and the broad empirical success of super-resolution methods. The key rationale is that, to be determined by its low-frequency components, the target signal must possess a low-dimensional structure. Instead of assuming that the signal itself lies on a low-dimensional manifold in the signal space, we assume that it is generated from a model with a low-dimensional parameter space. This shift of perspective allows us to analyze stability directly through the model parameters. Within this framework, we can recover the signal by solving a nonlinear least square problem and achieve super-resolution by extracting its high-frequency components. Theoretically, the resolution-enhancing map is proven to have Lipschitz continuity, with a constant that depends crucially on parameter separation conditions\. This separation condition can be effectively enforced via sparsity modeling, which requires using the minimal number of parameters to represent the measured signal, thereby highlighting the role of sparsity in the stability of super-resolution. Moreover, the Lipschitz constant grows with the high-frequency cutoff, ultimately rendering extrapolation ineffective beyond a certain threshold. We apply the general theory to three concrete models and give the stability estimates for each model. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the super-resolution behavior of the proposed framework. The model-based mathematical framework can be extended to problems with similar structures.</description>

      <title>Anatomically Guided Motion Correction for Placental IVIM Parameter Estimation with Accelerated Sampling Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method that may be applied to the placenta to help diagnose abnormal pregnancies. IVIM requires prolonged scan times, followed by a model-based estimation procedure. Maternal or fetal motion during the scan affects the accuracy of this estimation. In this work, we proposed to address this challenging motion correction and data fitting problem by using additional anatomical information that is routinely collected at the beginning of the examination. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) was applied to these anatomical data, to provide a patient-specific, 3D isotropic, anatomic reference. Our first contribution is a novel framework with a two-step motion correction that uses both IVIM and the SRR anatomic data, accounting for both intra- and inter-scan, non-rigid motion. Our second contribution is an automation and acceleration of the IVIM data fitting, using a state-of-the-art Bayesian-type algorithm, modified with a preconditioned Crank-Nicholson (pCN) sampling strategy. The accuracy of the IVIM parameter fitting was improved by the proposed motion correction strategy, as assessed by the mean absolute fitting error in the region of interest, which was 4.14 before and 3.02 after correction (arbitrary units of signal intensity). The novel sampling strategy accelerated parameter estimation by 39% in average, with the same accuracy as that of the conventional Bayesian approach. In conclusion, the proposed method may be applied to obtain fast and reliable IVIM parameter estimates in challenging scenarios such as prenatal MRI.</description>

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the community.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$ -- hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$ -- that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>
