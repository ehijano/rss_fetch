      <title>Quantum Particle Creation by Cosmic Strings in de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the phenomenon of particle creation associated with cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime, a model that represents the universe exponential expansion. We examine how the presence of cosmic strings in a de Sitter background affects particle production, focusing on the roles of string tension and angular deficits. Utilizing the Klein Gordon equation adapted to curved spacetime with cosmic string defects, we derive solutions expressed through hypergeometric functions to describe particle states. Our findings highlight how string properties influence particle creation rates and energy distributions. By analyzing both point-like and linear potentials near the string, we determine exact solutions, investigate asymptotic behaviors, and calculate particle creation probabilities using Bogoliubov transformations.</description>

      <title>Observer in quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the new formalism of quantum theory - the quantum principle of least action - the initial state of the universe is determined, which is an analogue of the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wave function. The quantum evolution of the universe is modified by an additional condition in a certain compact region of space-time, which is called the observation region. The additional condition is the covariant conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor of matter. The consequence of this is the deterministic nature of the motion of the energy and momentum densities of matter in the observation region. The geometric parameters of the region boundary are also determined by the deterministic motion of the matter fields inside. The choice of boundary conditions for the energy-momentum flow at the boundary serves as a mechanism for decoherence of the quantum evolution of the universe. The result of decoherence is a certain correspondence of the final state of the universe, including its norm, to the state of the observer in the specified region. It is proposed to use the norm of the final state as an action functional in quantum cosmology, which determines the world history of the universe as it is seen by the observer.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing cosmic expansion in $f(R, G)$ gravity using a log-periodic deceleration model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time cosmology in $f(R, G)=R+\alpha R^{2}+\beta e^{\gamma G}$, using a logarithmic parametrization of the deceleration parameter $q(z)=q_{0}+q_{1}sin[log(1+z)]$. The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is reconstructed and model parameters are constrained via MCMC analysis using CC ($31$), BAO ($26$) and Pantheon+SHOES ($1701$) datasets. Our results yield a Hubble constant in the range $H_0 = 71.7$--$72.8$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with late-time observations. The present deceleration parameter is found to be $q_{0}=-0.484$ to $-0.517$, while the evolution parameter $q_{1}\approx 1$, indicating increasing acceleration. The transition redshift shifts from $z_{tr}=0.879$ (CC) to $0.744$ (CC+BAO+Pantheon+SHOES), supporting a dynamic acceleration phase. The model reproduces early radiation behavior with $\omega (z&gt;&gt;1) \approx 0.33$ and predicts present-day values $\omega_{0} \approx -0.49$. Energy conditions NEC and DEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated at late times. The statefinder parameters $\{r_0, s_0\} = (0.866, 0.046)$ lie near the $\Lambda$CDM point. Estimated age of the Universe ranges from $13.01$ to $13.59$ Gyr. Thermodynamic analysis confirms consistency with the generalized second law. Overall, the model offers a viable and observationally consistent description of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Cosmological insights from an exponential $Om(z)$ function in $f(T,T_{G})$ gravity framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a modified teleparallel gravity model defined by $f(T,T_{G})=T+\gamma\sqrt{T_{G}}+\delta\sqrt{T}$ by introducing an exponential $Om(z)$ diagnostic of the form $Om(z)=\alpha e^{\frac{z}{1+z}}+\beta$. This novel form captures smooth redshift evolution and allows for a flexible, model-independent probe of dark energy dynamics. We derive a Hubble function from this expression and use MCMC analysis with $31$ CC, $26$ BAO and $1701$ Pantheon+ data points to constrain the model parameters. The best-fit results yield $H_{0} \in [68.46, 77.38]$km/s/Mpc for $\alpha \in [-0.232, -0.068]$ and $\beta \in [0.218, 0.560]$ which is consistent with local $H_{0}$ values. Our model predicts a transition redshift $z_{tr} \approx (0.48-0.54)$, present $q_{0}\approx -0.34$, and $\omega_{0}\approx-0.33$. It satisfies NEC and DEC, closely tracks $\Lambda$CDM in the statefinder plane and estimates a cosmic age of $(13.28-13.87)$ Gyr which confirms its strength in explaining late-time acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that the exponential $Om(z)$ parameterization provides a robust and insightful approach to trace dark energy evolution within modified gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>Constraint instabilities in first-order viscous relativistic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic hydrodynamics provides a solid framework for evolving matter and energy in a wide variety of phenomena. Nevertheless, the inclusion of dissipative effects in realistic scenarios through causal, stable, and well-posed theories still constitutes an open problem. In this paper, we point out that the first-order reduction originally proposed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha and Kovtun (BDNK) for proving the local well-posedness of conformally-invariant viscous fluids in Sobolev spaces, admits a set of differential constraints which do not propagate along evolution. To see so, we first show analytically that this is the case for uniform-velocity configurations. Motivated by this result, we perform numerical simulations of the BDNK first-order reduction restricted to plane-symmetric configurations in Minkowski spacetime. We report on initial data sets which satisfy the constraints, but display exponential grow at early times. Thus, although the principal part of the reduction is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues --as proved by BDNK--, the corresponding differential constraints appearing from it are not conserved along evolution. This result suggests that an alternative path is needed to prove the strong-hyperbolicity for the conformal version of the theory.</description>

      <title>Stability and collisions of excited spherical boson stars: glimpses of chains and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar, spherically symmetric, radially excited boson stars were previously shown to be stabilized, against spherical dynamics, by sufficiently strong self-interactions. Here, we further test their stability now in a full 3+1D evolution. We show that the stable stars in the former case become afflicted by a non-spherical instability. Then, we perform head-on collisions of both (stable) fundamental and (sufficiently long-lived) excited boson stars. Depending on the stars chosen, either a black hole or a bosonic remnant are possible. In particular, collisions of excited stars result in a bosonic bound state which resembles a dynamical superposition of chains and rings, akin to the ones found as equilibrium solutions in Liang:2025myf. These evolutions emphasize a key difference concerning the dynamical robustness of fundamental vs. excited spherical boson stars, when generic (beyond spherical) dynamics is considered.</description>

      <title>New Methods for Offline GstLAL Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present new methods implemented in the GstLAL offline gravitational wave search. These include a technique to reuse the matched filtering data products from a GstLAL online analysis, which hugely reduces the time and computational resources required to obtain offline results; a technique to combine these results with a separate search for heavier black hole mergers, enabling detections from a larger set of gravitational wave sources; changes to the likelihood ratio which increases the sensitivity of the analysis; and two separate changes to the background estimation, allowing more precise significance estimation of gravitational wave candidates. Some of these methods increase the sensitivity of the analysis, whereas others correct previous mis-estimations of sensitivity by eliminating false positives. These methods have been adopted for GstLAL's offline results during the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (O4). To test these new methods, we perform an offline analysis over one chunk of O3 data, lasting from May 12 19:36:42 UTC 2019 to May 21 14:45:08 UTC 2019, and compare it with previous GstLAL results over the same period of time. We show that cumulatively these methods afford around a 50% - 100% increase in sensitivity in the highest mass space, while simultaneously increasing the reliability of results, and making them more reusable and computationally cheaper.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes in Loop Quantum Gravity. LN3: Boundary equations for Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shall here perform the canonical analysis of field equations of ABI model in order to determine constraint equations. We shall show that one can use algebraic constraints in the covariant framework to fix $k^i$ as a function of the frame and obtain a model where $(A^i_a, E_i^a)$ is a pair of independent fields which are also a pair of conjugated fields.
  We shall not impose any relation on Immirzi parameter $\beta$ and Holst parameter $\gamma$, still constraint equations will depend on $\beta$ only and they agree with standard result of LQG which are obtained by a suitable canonical transformation on a leaf of the ADM foliation used to define a Hamiltonian framework. We eventually state the scheme for quantization that will be discussed in the following lecture notes.</description>

      <title>Reducing the irreducible: the charged black hole bomb in a moving cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the charged black hole bomb by numerically solving the fully non-linear Einstein-Maxwell-(charged, complex) Klein-Gordon system with a moving mirror. By dynamically varying the cavity size, we find that the system evolves toward new hairy black hole equilibria. Expanding the mirror radius enhances superradiant extraction, increasing both the scalar field charge and the black hole's irreducible mass. Remarkably, on the other hand, shrinking the cavity size has the opposite effect: the black hole is able to reduce its irreducible mass as more charge than energy flows back from the field, without violating charge conservation or energy conditions. As a consistency check, in the limit of a vanishing cavity, we find that the system returns to the original Reissner-Nordstr\"om configuration. We discuss the implications of these findings for black hole thermodynamics in confined configurations where superradiant modes exist and the limitations of this setup, particularly in relation to Hawking's black hole area theorem.</description>

      <title>Black-hole hair from vector dark matter accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a single black hole in equilibrium with a dark photon-cold dark matter environment. Representing the dark photon as a Proca field, we show that a Schwarzschild black hole grows vector-field "hair" when allowed to accrete from an infinite homogeneous bath of particles far from the horizon. We solve the Proca equation in linear perturbation theory, separating it using the vector spherical harmonics and Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos approaches for the odd-parity and even-parity sectors, respectively. In the "particle" dark matter regime, the field is purely infalling and exhibits a sharply peaked density profile, in concordance with the particle dark matter "spikes" studied in the literature. In the "wave" regime, the field exhibits standing waves, and the profile is smeared. We find a dark-matter density amplification upward of $10^7$ near the horizon. Though small for most black holes, we find the mass enclosed in the cloud can reach $\sim 1 \%$ of the black hole mass for large supermassive black holes. These black holes are also most susceptible to vector dark matter accretion, with mass accretion rates as large as $10 M_\odot/$yr.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Pulsar Signals in Astrophysical Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the fully relativistic time delay of pulsar signals propagating in the vicinity of a rotating black hole and its potential mimickers, including a deformed Kerr black hole and the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity. We aim to compute and compare the pulsar time delays caused by different spacetime geometries to explore possible observational signatures that distinguish between black holes and their alternatives. We begin by solving the equations of motion for null geodesics in these background geometries. Subsequently, we address the emitter-observer problem to compute the time delay of pulsar signals in Kerr, deformed Kerr, and JNW spacetimes. A comparative analysis between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes allows us to observe the effect of spin on propagation delay in pulsar timing. Further, we examine the impact of the deformation parameter in the deformed Kerr black hole and the influence of the scalar field on the rotating JNW spacetime. Our study considers both direct and indirect photons emitted by a source in the equatorial circular orbit. We find that the variations in the spin parameter show very small but detectable changes when we compare the time delay cases of a Kerr black hole with deformed Kerr and rotating JNW spacetimes. Our pulsar time delay results suggest a potential observable distinguishing feature of these astrophysical black hole geometries which could be useful for the forthcoming observational facilities such as Square Kilometer Array Observatory, Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope and Event Horizon Telescope.</description>

      <title>The de Sitter Weak Gravity Conjecture from 3-Form Black Holes and Inflation with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the de Sitter (dS) Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and slow-roll inflation within a framework governed by a 3-form gauge field. Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that the dS WGC can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Across the Horizon: On Gravitational Wave Flux Laws and Tests of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the first detection of gravitational waves, this dissertation develops analytical, numerical, and data analysis techniques to address persistent blind spots in our understanding of gravity. Beginning with asymptotically flat spacetimes and the geometry of null geodesic congruences, the derivation of the shear tensor--encoding gravitational radiation--is revisited. The covariant phase space formulation of General Relativity is then employed to derive a non-conservation law associated with the symmetry group at null infinity, generalizing prior constructions of radiative phase space and yielding consistent results. These flux laws are used to derive constraint equations that enable the evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art numerical waveform models, leading to new insights and a robust algorithm for benchmarking future improvements. These flux laws are further applied to compute quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms arising from the gravitational wave echo effect. Two leading phenomenological scenarios involving echoes from binary black hole mergers are analyzed. The structure of both the primary echo signal and its induced corrections to nonlinear features of the waveform are studied for observability by the upcoming LISA mission. The results indicate that LISA could detect such signals, potentially probing black hole area quantization. Finally, motivated by recent hints of a stochastic gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Array data, this work reviews its theoretical basis and studies several astrophysical and cosmological source scenarios. A forecast for detection prospects with LISA is presented using a modern data analysis pipeline. The results suggest LISA will constrain the extra-galactic stochastic background to a spectral energy density below $ \Omega_\text{GW} \lesssim 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>AthenaK simulations of the binary black hole merger GW150914</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new binary black hole simulations targeted to GW150914 using the GPU-accelerated code \texttt{AthenaK}. We compute the properties of the final remnant with the isolated horizon formalism and obtain gravitational-waveforms at future null infinity via Cauchy characteristic extraction. We compare our results with those obtained by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) groups, targeted to the same event. We find excellent agreement in the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity. For the dominant $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode of the gravitational-wave signal we find maximum dephasing of $\Delta \phi \simeq 0.35$ and amplitude difference of $\Delta A/A \simeq 0.4\%$. We use our newly computed waveform to re-analyze the GW150914 data and find posteriors for chirp mass, luminosity distance, and inclination that are broadely consistent with those obtained using semi-analytic waveform models. This work demonstrates the viability of \texttt{AthenaK} for many-orbits binary black hole merger simulations. A step-by-step tutorial, including all necessary input files and analysis scripts to reproduce our results, is available on \texttt{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between new agegraphic and Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter in the context of $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universe in the context of $f(T)$ gravity with flat-FRW background and consider it to be a combination of three components: baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. We consider the new agegraphic as an alternative for dark energy and the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) as an alternative for dark matter. After that, first we obtain the Friedman equations and then we obtain the continuity equations in the presence of the interaction term between the dark components of the universe, so that the interaction term is considered as the flow of energy from dark matter to dark energy. In what follows, we plot the variation of the cosmological parameters of dark energy in terms of the redshift parameter by using of the power-law cosmology. Finally, we investigate the evolution and stability of the universe and report the values of the density parameters of the universe components that confirm the present model with observational data.</description>

      <title>Phase Diffusion of Light Immersed In Quantum Tides: Open Quantum System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between quantum gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) fields is investigated within the open quantum system formalism, where GWs are considered as a heat bath reservoir occupying a generic state $\hat{\rho}_{\text{gws}}$. Following the quantum Langevin equations, it turns out that the correlations of the Langevin noise operator associated with the GW background directly determine the statistical properties of the EM phasor $\phi(t)$. We apply this formalism to the background of inflationary-generated primordial gravitational waves (PGW). Since this background has an astronomically large correlation time, of the order of the Hubble time $H_0^{-1}$, we show that it leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the EM field, which causes memory effects. As a result of the Gaussianity of PGW, it turns out that the EM phasor goes through a stochastic process, which is a manifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation in EM-GW system. The variance of the EM phase smears out as $\Delta^2\varphi(t)= \Delta^2\varphi_0+ 4(t/\tau_c)^4$, where the characteristic time scale $\tau_c$ is associated with the diffusion rate caused by PGWs. The specific quartic growth of the phase noise is thus attributed to the two-mode squeezed nature of PGWs, which is inherently different from the phase diffusion induced by vacuum fluctuations of spacetime or a thermal heat bath of gravitons.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Barriers: Kramers' Escape Rate Analysis of Metastable Dynamics in First-Order Multi-Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expanding application of classical thermodynamic methods to black hole physics has yielded significant advances in characterizing phase transition behavior. Among these approaches, thermodynamic analysis -- particularly kinetic formulations like the Kramers' escape rate -- provides a robust framework for probing black hole phase transitions with minimal relativistic constraints. This study investigates the kinetics and dynamic evolution of first-order phase transitions in black holes exhibiting multiple critical points, employing a particle-based escape rate model. The distinct free energy landscapes inherent to multi-critical systems, which can simultaneously support multiple local minima under specific thermodynamic conditions (temperature and pressure) within a given reference frame, raise fundamental questions regarding transition pathways. We rigorously assess whether the Kramers' escape rate retains its predictive validity in these complex multi-minima systems, as established for conventional single-minimum configurations. Furthermore, we examine whether transitions proceed via a sequential, stepwise mechanism between adjacent minima, or if pathways exist that bypass intermediate states through direct descent to the global minimum. Our analysis of black holes undergoing multiphase transitions reveals both parallels and significant deviations from single-transition models. Crucially, we demonstrate that the Kramers' escape rate remains a quantitatively reliable indicator of first-order phase transitions in black holes, even within multi-critical frameworks. This approach offers deeper insights into the governing energetic landscapes and kinetic processes underlying these phenomena.</description>

      <title>A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizon structure is exactly that of the Kerr spacetime. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden position-dependent change (a quench) in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed by Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide new support for this analogue by analysing the entanglement of a scalar field in a (1 + 1)-dimensional continuum spacetime with a similar quench, and the harvesting of this entanglement by a pair of Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We present numerical evidence that the concurrence and mutual information harvested by the detectors are qualitatively similar to those in Rindler spacetime, but they exhibit a small yet noticeable variation when the energy pulse created by the quench crosses the detectors. These findings provide further motivation to implement the experimental proposal of Rodr\'iguez-Laguna et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute explicitly the equations of motion of the Hamiltonian formulation of quadratic gravity. This is the theory with the most general Lagrangian with terms of quadratic order in the curvature tensor. We employ the symbolic computational tool Cadabra. We present the linearized version of the equations of motion, performing the longitudinal-transverse decomposition. We compare the linear equations with the covariant field equations, finding that, if general-relativity terms are active, the linear Hamiltonian formulation is valid only if the perturbative spatial metric is traceless, a condition that can be freely imposed by recurring to an arbitrary function. We apply the equations of motion on homogeneous and isotropic configurations, finding explicit solutions.</description>

      <title>Charged scalar boson in Melvin universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the dynamics of a charged scalar boson in the Melvin universe by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with minimal coupling in both inertial and non-inertial frames. Non-inertial effects are introduced through a rotating reference frame, resulting in a modified spacetime geometry and the appearance of a critical radius that limits the radial domain of the field. Analytical solutions are obtained under appropriate approximations, and the corresponding energy spectra are derived. The results indicate that both the magnetic field and non-inertial effects modify the energy levels, with additional contributions depending on the coupling between the rotation parameter and the quantum numbers. A numerical analysis is also presented, illustrating the behavior of the solutions for two characteristic magnetic field scales: one that may be considered extreme, of the order of the ones proposed to be produced in heavy-ion collisions and another near the Planck scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Klein-Gordon equation and Schr\"odinger equation on curved manifolds embedded in high-dimensional manifolds to describe the motion of constrained spineless particles. We start from the equations on the main manifold and obtain the effective equations on the submanifold by degenerate additional dimensions. A geometric induced potential appears in our results.We reviewed the previous works of others and our results are consistent in the special case they calculated,We focused on discussing our results under general conditions and obtained a connection between differential geometry and physics.Especially the influence of peripheral manifolds on submanifold physics is somewhat counterintuitive.We have analyzed several explicit examples, presenting an elucidation of the interactions between the submanifold and matter fields. In one specific case, our approach derived the mass term of scalar fields on a lower-dimensional manifold through purely geometric induction. This mass term coincides with that in Kaluza-Klein theory, yet was achieved without invoking any periodic compactification constraints.</description>

      <title>Butterfly in Spacetime: Inherent Instabilities in Stable Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper numerically studies the time evolution of s-wave scalar probe field in a black hole of which the event horizon is surrounded by matter. As a toy model, it encodes the effects of matter into deformations of Regge-Wheeler potential. It considers three different types of local deformations in the vicinity of the event horizon, the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of an arbitrarily strongly stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.</description>

      <title>Open quantum battery in the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charging performance of a quantum battery (QB) coupled to a scalar field under the background of a three-dimensional rotating black hole. It is shown that under Dirichlet boundary conditions, when the QB's energy level spacing is smaller than the charging amplitude, the black hole rotation enhances the charging performance at finite times, whereas in other parameter regimes, it degrades the charging performance. Notably, as the black hole approaches extremal rotation, charging performance undergoes significant amplification or suppression, depending on the parameter regime. This indicates that the performance of QBs can probe critical properties of black holes. Additionally, regarding the energy flow in QB, it is further demonstrated that the energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations via dissipation, and rotation suppresses the QB's capacity to extract this energy. Our findings not only advance the relativistic dissipation dynamics of QBs but also propose a novel method to detect black hole rotation and extremal-state transitions.</description>

      <title>Absence of curvature singularities in symmetric perfect fluid spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the higher dimensional homogeneous and isotropic perfect fluid spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. We solve the modified field equations with higher order curvature terms to determine the evolution of the scale factor. We transparently show that this scale factor cannot become smaller than a finite minimum positive value which depends on the dimension and equation of state. This bound completely eliminates any curvature singularities in the spacetimes, where the scale factor must tend to zero. This is a unique property of EGB gravity which, despite being ghost-free and having quasi-linear field equations like general relativity, allows for the violation of singularity theorems. This phenomenon, thus, gives a natural way to dynamically construct regular black holes via higher dimensional continual gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>$f(R, G, T)$ Gravity: Cosmological Implications and Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07623v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological implications of a four-dimensional extension of the Gauss-Bonnet f(G) gravity, where $G$ is the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function $f(R,G,T)$ of G, of the Ricci scalar $R$, and of the trace $T$ of the matter energy-momentum tensor. By construction, the extended Gauss-Bonnet type action involves a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry. The field equations of the model are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric. The generalized Friedmann equations, describing the cosmological evolution in the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, are also presented in their general form. We investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe in the generalized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theiry for a specific choice of the Lagrangian density, as given by $f(R, G, T) = \alpha_1 G + \alpha_2 R^{\beta} - 2\alpha_3 \sqrt{-T}$, where $\alpha_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) are model parameters. First, the theoretical predictions of the model are compared with a set of observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type IA Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) via an MCMC analysis, which allows us to obtain constraints on the model parameters. A comparison with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM system is also performed. Next, the generalized Friedmann equations are reformulated as a dynamical system, and the properties of its critical points are studied by using the Lyapunov linear stability analysis. This investigation allows for the reconstruction of the Universe's history in this model, from the early inflationary era to the late accelerating phase. The statefinder diagnostic parameters for the model are also considered from the dynamical system perspective.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse of Matter in the presence of Scalar field Dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the gravitational collapse of an overdense dark matter region in a coupled scalar field dark energy scenario within a flat FLRW background. It finds that, depending on the initial conditions, some overdense regions avoid collapse and expand eternally with the background. The interior overdense region follows a closed FLRW metric, while its boundary is described by generalized Vaidya spacetime, which allows flux across the boundary while preserving the homogeneity of dark energy inside. Dark matter evolves as cold dark matter, but in non-minimal coupling, the modified Klein-Gordon equation alters dark energy evolution. The results highlight the impact of coupled dark energy on dark matter virialization and cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain general relativistic time-dependent gravitational fields, free test particles can asymptotically line up relative to fiducial static observers and produce a cosmic jet whose speed approaches the speed of light. Two scenarios for the formation of these purely gravitational jets have thus far been theoretically demonstrated: the double-jet collapse scenario and the wave scenario that involves both a cosmic jet in the general direction of wave propagation as well as a counterjet in the opposite direction. These scenarios are briefly reviewed in this paper. Moreover, to elucidate the process of jet formation in these scenarios, we study the propagation of scalar fields in related gravitational fields in connection with the correspondence between the scalar wave perturbations and the motion of free test particles and null rays.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation between Pulsars from Interfering Gravitational-Wave Sources in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nanohertz band, the spatial correlations in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) produced by interfering gravitational waves (GWs) from multiple sources likely deviate from the traditional ones without interference under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ensemble. This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Polymer Geodesic Motion in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we will study the geodesic motion of massive particles, in a Schwarzschild background, with a semi-classical quantum framework called "Polymer Quantum Mechanics" (PQM) in order to investigate the black hole phenomenology resulting from this formulation, which accounts for Planckian scale physics. In particular we studied two main scenarios, being the radial in-fall and circular orbits and their stability. In this framework, we built an effective Hamiltonian taking into account the polymer quantum effects, altering the classical equations of motion with Planckian scale corrections. As a main result, we obtained the existence of a classically forbidden region surrounding the event horizon, preventing particles from crossing it. Additionally, we discovered the presence of stable circular orbits below both the classical Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the horizon (corresponding to closed time-like geodesics).</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from QCD phase transition in the framework of higher-order GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by a first-order cosmological QCD phase transition in the early universe, within the framework of a new higher-order generalized uncertainty principle. This model predicts a minimal length scale for both positive and negative values of the deformation parameter $\beta$. However, our analysis shows that only positive $\beta$ leads to physically viable stochastic gravitational wave background spectra. We derive generalized uncertainty principle induced corrections to the radiation energy density and the Hubble expansion rate and analyze their impact on the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background signal. The results indicate that an increase in $\beta$ leads to a redshift in the peak frequency and a modest enhancement in the energy density. Finally, we examine the detectability of these modified signals by comparing them with the sensitivity curves of current and upcoming pulsar timing arrays. Our findings suggest that the stochastic gravitational wave background signal for positive $\beta$ values can be probed by observatories such as SKA, IPTA, and NANOGrav, offering a potential avenue for testing the effects of quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dyonic black holes in a weak field expansion of non-linear electrodynamics. The breadth of parameter space permits a rich thermodynamic structure, additional turning points and intricate phase phenomena. Energy conditions are employed to ensure the physical viability of solutions. Analytic special cases illustrate novel properties of black holes in non-linear electrodynamics, including modified extremal limit behaviour. Numerical solutions offer the most elaborate thermodynamic landscape, culminating in up to five turning points, and multiple reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space Metric Tensor from Nonadiabatic Evolution of Bloch Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal a fundamental geometric structure of momentum space arising from the nonadiabatic evolution of Bloch electrons. By extending semiclassical wave packet theory to incorporate nonadiabatic effects, we introduce a momentum-space metric tensor -- the nonadiabatic metric. This metric gives rise to two velocity corrections, dubbed geometric and geodesic velocities, providing a unified and intuitive framework for understanding nonlinear and nonadiabatic transport phenomena beyond Berry phase effects. Furthermore, we show that the nonadiabatic metric endows momentum space with a curved geometry, recasting wave packet dynamics as forced geodesic motion. In this picture, the metric defines distances, the Berry connection acts as a gauge potential, band dispersion serves as a scalar potential, and the toroidal topology of the Brillouin zone imposes periodic boundary conditions. When the nonadiabatic metric is constant, it reduces to an effective mass, allowing electrons to behave as massive particles in flat bands. In a flat Chern band with harmonic attractive interactions, the two-body wave functions mirror the Landau-level wave functions on a torus.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-Attractor E-Model in Warm Inflation: Observational Viability from Planck 2018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Save $R^2$ Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the latest Planck-Atacama Cosmology Telescope (P-ACT) joint results on the primordial scalar power spectrum, we show that the $R^2$ inflation model extended with a non-minimally coupled scalar field $\chi$--namely the $R^2$-Higgs model--can yield a larger spectral index $n_s$ and a small positive running $\alpha_s$ at cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales, which are consistent with the data. This is because the $\chi$ field contributes a blue-tilted component to the primordial power spectrum which both modifies the large-scale power and, as a result, significantly enhances power on small scales. The consequent enhancement be large enough to lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) of mass $\lesssim 10^{20}\mathrm{g}$, accounting for all of the dark matter. Furthermore, future observations of the small-scale power spectrum, CMB spectral distortions, and stochastic gravitational waves will provide decisive tests of this model and its predictions for PBHs.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p &lt; t_0 &lt; 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational wave signals in a non-supersymmetric grand unified model where the group $SO(10)$ is broken in two steps to the Standard Model gauge group. We calculate the analytical form of the one-loop effective potential responsible for the first step of symmetry breaking and show that it can lead to a first-order phase transition with gravitational wave production. We also determine the gravitational wave background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles. The present experimental sensitivity is still far from the expected signals but could be in reach of novel detector concepts.</description>

      <title>CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.</description>

      <title>Photon rings in a holographic toy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light circling around an astrophysical black hole can spend a long time skirting its unstably bound photon orbits before escaping to infinity. To a distant observer, this orbiting light would appear as a bright ring encircling the image of the black hole. Though not yet resolved by radio-interferometric observations from the ground, this ``photon ring'' will be the target of future space-based black hole observations. Motivated by this experimental prospect, studies have sought to elucidate the theoretical connections between the photon ring -- an observable, classical effect -- and the putative holographic description of black holes in quantum gravity. General relativity predicts that the detailed structure of the photon ring encodes the high-frequency (eikonal) spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted by a perturbed black hole as it rings down, and also that the photon ring displays an emergent conformal symmetry that acts upon this spectrum. In holography, the classical QNM frequencies are expected to map to Ruelle resonances of the dual quantum theory. In this paper, we explore these connections in a lower-dimensional toy model based on Warped AdS$_3$ black holes that shares many features with the (3+1)-dimensional Kerr background -- including a photon ring at finite radius -- while still providing analytic control of the QNM frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in sub-solar mass black holes due to their potential to provide valuable information about cosmology or the black hole population. Motivated by this, we study observable phenomena connected to the merger of a sub-solar mass black hole with a neutron star. For this purpose, we perform new numerical-relativity simulations of a binary system composed of a black hole with mass $0.5M_\odot$ and a neutron star with mass $1.4 M_\odot$. We investigate the merger dynamics of this exotic system and provide information about the connected gravitational-wave and kilonova signals. Our study indicates that current gravitational-waveform models cannot adequately describe such systems and that phenomenological relations connecting the binary parameters with the ejecta and remnant properties do not apply to our system. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the kilonova signal on the azimuthal viewing angle due to the asymmetric mass ejection. This first-of-its-kind simulation opens the door for studying sub-solar mass black hole - neutron star mergers and could serve as a testing ground for future model development.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Euler-Heisenberg Black Hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational lensing of Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. This kind of black hole solution enables us to investigate the nontrivial interplay between the dark matter effects and nonlinear electrodynamics effects (or quantum electrodynamics effects) on charged black hole systems. The important observables in gravitational lensings are calculated and discussed in our work, including the gravitational deflection angle of light and time delay of light. Additionally, we also explore the massive orbit's bound orbits (and their precession angles) and black hole shadow radius for Euler-Heisenberg black hole in the presence of dark matter. The results indicate that the Euler-Heisenberg black hole with a larger perfect fluid dark matter parameter could greatly reduce the gravitational deflection angle of light, time delay of light, and precession angle of massive object's bound orbit, while the nonlinear electrodynamics effects do not have large influences on these observables.

      <title>Charged black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T) = R + \beta T$. In the limit $\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \approx R$. We propose a power-law Lagrangian of the form $\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \alpha F^p$, where $\alpha =f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we derive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant. Our analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$, where we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these solutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we verify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event horizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the free forms of the first and second derivatives $\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field. From these relations, we derive the general form of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations. This Lagrangian exhibits an intrinsic nonlinearity due to the influence of two constants, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Specifically, $\alpha$ originates from the power-law term in the proposed Lagrangian, while $\beta$ arises from the assumed linear function $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the nonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, rather than $\alpha$ alone.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode expansions of black hole perturbations: a hyperboloidal Keldysh's approach</title>

Abstract: We study quasinormal mode expansions by adopting a Keldysh scheme for the spectral construction of asymptotic resonant expansions. Quasinormal modes are first cast in terms of a non-selfadjoint problem by adopting, in a black hole perturbation setting, a spacetime hyperboloidal approach. Then the Keldysh expansion of the resolvent, built on bi-orthogonal systems, provides a spectral version of Lax-Phillips expansions on scattering resonances. We clarify the role of scalar product structures in the Keldysh setting, that prove non-necessary to construct the resonant expansions (in particular the quasinormal mode time-series at null infinity), but are required to define the (constant) excitation coefficients in the bulk resonant expansion. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Keldysh spectral approach to (non-selfadjoint) dynamics, even beyond its limits of validity, in particular recovering Schwarzschild black hole late power-law tails. We also study early dynamics by exploring i) the existence of an earliest time of validity of the resonant expansion and ii) the interplay between overtones extracted with the Keldysh scheme and regularity. Specifically, we address convergence aspects of the series and, on the other hand, we implement non-modal analysis tools, namely assessing $H^p$-Sobolev dynamical transient growths and constructing $H^p$-pseudospectra. Finally, we apply the Keldysh scheme to calculate ''second-order'' quasinormal modes and complement the qualitative study of overtone distribution by presenting the Weyl law for the counting of quasinormal modes in black holes with different (flat, De Sitter, anti-De Sitter) spacetime asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the fermionic quasi-bound states around Schwarzschild black holes with improved analytic spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes have long served as a testing ground for probing theories of gravity and quantum mechanics. Notably, fundamental fields in the neighborhood of black holes exhibit rich phenomena that could yield astrophysical observable signatures. However, exploring these structures typically requires computationally intensive numerical calculations. In this work, the dynamics of a massive Dirac field outside a Schwarzschild black hole is revisited. We propose a novel matching scheme that enables the analytical solution of the coupled first-order Dirac equation, as opposed to the conventional second-order approach. This method yields a compact and unified analytical expression for the energy spectrum, which shows improved agreement with numerical results. The improvement is due to high-order correction of angular parameter that has been ignored previously.</description>

      <title>Scalar Instabilities Inside The Extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen Black Hole: Novel Exact Solutions and Chronology Protection Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of test scalar fields in the region inside the extremal Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole (DKSBH) horizon, where closed timelike curves exist. We successfully find and present the novel exact solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in the extremal DKSBH spacetime in terms of the Double Confluent Heun functions. The spacetime stability is explored by investigating the scalar's quasiresonance~(QS) frequencies obtained from polynomial condition of the Double Confluent Heun function. We found that both massive and massless scalar quasiresonances are double branched, having purely positive and negative imaginary frequencies, therefore, do not propagate, prohibiting time travel and suggesting no violation of Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture (CPC). However, only the positive branch with $0\leq\Omega_0&lt;2(n+1)$ and negative branch with $\Omega_0&gt;2(n+1)$ that grow exponentially has the ability to destroy spacetime. Remarkably, a new mass scale $M_{p}^{2}/M$, where $M$ is the black hole mass, is found to play a crucial role. The QS zeroth modes flip sign between purely damping and purely growing when the scalar mass is at this mass scale.</description>

      <title>Length dependence of waveform mismatch: a caveat on waveform accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration's code SpEC can now routinely simulate binary black hole mergers undergoing $\sim25$ orbits, with the longest simulations undergoing nearly $\sim180$ orbits. While this sounds impressive, the mismatch between the highest resolutions for this long simulation is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. Meanwhile, the mismatch between resolutions for the more typical simulations tends to be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, despite the resolutions being similar to the long simulations'. In this note, we explain why mismatch alone gives an incomplete picture of code -- and waveform -- quality, especially in the context of providing waveform templates for LISA and 3G detectors, which require templates with $\mathcal{O}(10^{3}) - \mathcal{O}(10^{5})$ orbits. We argue that to ready the GW community for the sensitivity of future detectors, numerical relativity groups must be aware of this caveat, and also run future simulations with at least three resolutions to properly assess waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate warm inflation in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity within a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Unlike cold inflation, where the inflaton evolves in isolation, warm inflation features continuous interaction between the inflaton field and radiation throughout the inflationary epoch, facilitating energy transfer through dissipative processes and maintaining thermal equilibrium. In our novel approach, we employ $f(Q)$ dark energy as the driving mechanism for warm inflation, leveraging the geometric degrees of freedom associated with non-metricity as dynamical variables. We derive the field equations using slow-roll approximations and analyze two specific $f(Q)$ models: a power-law form $f(Q) = Q + mQ^n$ and a logarithmic form $f(Q) = mQ\ln(nQ)$. Our analysis focuses on the high dissipative regime where thermal fluctuations dominate over quantum fluctuations. We compute key inflationary observables including the scalar spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and slow-roll parameters. Our results demonstrate that $f(Q)$ dark energy successfully drives warm inflation while satisfying essential physical conditions: dominance of $f(Q)$ energy density over radiation density initially, and thermal fluctuations exceeding quantum fluctuations ($T &gt; H$). As inflation progresses, energy transfers from the geometric $f(Q)$ sector to radiation, eventually bringing both densities to comparable levels near inflation's end. Importantly, our computed values align well with current observational constraints from Planck and BICEP/Keck: $n_s = 0.965 \pm 0.004$ and $r &lt; 0.036$. This validates the viability of warm inflation in $f(Q)$ gravity and establishes a unified geometric framework for understanding both early universe inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: We explore on the one hand, whether the well-known theorem of equipartition of energy also applies to physical systems in which gravity plays a non-negligible role, as is the case of cosmological horizons and, on the other hand, if the holographic principle holds for these systems. Furthermore, we find a direct connection between the partition function of the gravitating system and the metric of the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>The radial metric function does not identify null surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which a hypersurface becomes null through the use of coordinate transformations. We demonstrate that, in static spacetimes, the correct criterion for a surface to be null is $g_{tt} = 0$, rather than $g^{rr} = 0$, in agreement with the results of Vollick. We further show that, if a Kruskal-like coordinate exists, the proxy condition $g^{rr} = 0$ is equivalent to $g_{tt} = 0$ if $\partial_r g_{tt} \neq 0$ and both $g^{rr}$ and $g_{tt}$ vanish at the same rate near the horizon. Our method extends naturally to axisymmetric stationary spacetimes, for which we demonstrate that the condition $\det\big(h_{ab}\big) = 0$ for the induced metric on a null hypersurface is recovered. By contrast with the induced metric approach, our method provides a physical perspective that connects the general null condition with its underlying relationship to photon geodesics.</description>

      <title>How black hole mimickers and Shapiro-free lenses signal effective dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the existence of two exotic compact objects in the leading relativistic model of modified Newtonian dynamics, namely aether-scalar-tensor theory. This model is consistent with precision cosmology and gravitational wave constraints on tensor speed. Black hole mimickers could subtly change observations: gravitational waves from their mergers might show unusual echoes or altered ringdown patterns, and images of their horizon-scale shadows might be slightly different from those of a true black hole. Shapiro-free lenses are massless objects that deflect light without any gravitational time delay, producing distinctive lensing events. These predictions connect to ongoing and future gravitational-wave searches, horizon-scale imaging, and time-domain lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Notes on a Gaussian-Based Distribution Algebra for the Non-linear Wave Equation of the Shift Vector in Quantum Foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes, a non-linear distributional renormalisation algebra is developed, tailored to the geometry of Gaussian Quantum Foam. The construction is based on sequences of smooth Gaussian functions restricted to spacelike hypersurfaces in a sequence of homotopic and globally hyperbolic spacetimes, converging in the sense of distributions to Quantum Foam.
  A restricted subspace of Schwartz functions is defined, consisting of finite products of scaled Gaussians supported on the hypersurfaces. An associated distribution space is introduced as the space of distributional limits of such sequences. The resulting renormalisation algebra is closed under addition, multiplication, and arbitrary-order differentiation, with all non-linear operations defined at the level of smooth representatives prior to taking the limit.
  This algebra is then applied to the non-linear scalar wave equation governing the shift vector field. In the distributional limit, the wave operator acting on the Gaussian sequence yields a linear combination of the Dirac measure and its second-order derivative, which together encode the singular curvature response of the collapsing Quantum Foam element.
  The presence of the measure's second-order derivative signals a sharply localised curvature impulse, consistent with a quantum geometric source driving the displacement of the vacuum. Meanwhile, the measure term corresponds to a uniform shift across the hypersurfaces, reflecting residual translation in the emerging classical geometry.
  In the classical limit, the non-linear wave equation reduces to the massless vacuum Klein-Gordon equation, thereby linking the quantum and classical regimes through a unified distributional formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the dynamics of a dust shell in an effective theory of spherically symmetric gravity containing quantum corrections from loop quantum gravity is investigated. To provide a consistent framework for including the dust, we go beyond the standard formulation of the effective theory by introducing an action that includes not only the effective Hamiltonian constraint, but also the diffeomorphism constraint, along with appropriate gauge-fixing and boundary terms. By adding the dust shell action and substituting vacuum solutions for the interior and exterior regions, we derive a reduced action in which only the shell radius $\mathfrak{x}$ and the exterior black hole mass appear as dynamical variables. Varying the reduced action yields the evolution equation for $\mathfrak{x}$, which is then solved numerically to explore the dynamical properties of the dust shell and the continuity properties of the metric. Finally, our approach is compared with previous studies to highlight key differences and improvements.</description>

      <title>Viscosity in Isotropic Cosmological Backgrounds in General Relativity and Starobinsky Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general analysis of the role of shear viscosity in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on isotropic space-time in both Einstein and $f(R)$ gravity. By computing the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in a general class of isotropic (but not necessarily homogeneous) geometries, we show that shear viscosity does not contribute to the background dynamics when the fluid is comoving. This result holds in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and implies that shear viscosity cannot affect the electromagnetic luminosity distance which is determined by the background light-like geodesics. As an application of our results, we critically examine recent claims that shear viscosity can alter the Hubble evolution and the electromagnetic luminosity distance in Starobinsky gravity. We demonstrate that the continuity equation used in that work is at odds both with the covariant conservation of the stress-energy tensor and the local second law of thermodynamics. We further show that even in models where such modifications could mimic bulk viscosity, the resulting entropy evolution is inconsistent with standard thermodynamic expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of geodynamics in a space-time crystal based on an event wave packet constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space manifold of space-time and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a particle not only involves the lattice connection but also higher-order corrections from space-time inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi energy-momentum dispersion gradients. These emergent connections and metric terms in the geodesic equations indicate the potential to experimentally realize artificial gravitational effects, thereby establishing a direct conceptual link between general relativity and quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A concrete model of extracting the physics from the bulk of a gravitational universe is important to the study of quantum gravity and its possible relationship with experiments. Such a model can be constructed in the AdS/CFT correspondence by gluing a bath on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This bath models a laboratory and is described by a quantum field theory. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT) description this coupling is achieved by a double-trace deformation that couples the CFT with the bath. This suggests that the physics observed by the laboratory is fully unitary. In this paper, we analyze the quantum aspects of this model in detail which conveys new lessons about the AdS/CFT correspondence, and we discuss the potential usefulness of this model in understanding subregion physics in a gravitational universe.</description>

Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-20}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $1~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to gravitational wave emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 20 within a 4 yr observation run, if all dark matter is made up of $\sim30{\rm\,M}_\odot$ PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Wedge Holographic Complexity in Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate holographic complexities in the context of wedge holography, focusing specifically on black string geometry in AdS$_3$. The wedge spacetime is bounded by two end-of-the-world (EOW) branes with intrinsic Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity. In line with this codimension-two holography, there are three equivalent perspectives: bulk perspective, brane perspective, and boundary perspective. Using both the ''Complexity=Volume'' (CV) and ''Complexity=Action'' (CA) proposals, we analyze the complexity in wedge black string geometry in the tensionless limit. By treating the branes as rigid, we find the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match exactly across bulk and brane perspectives. These results are consistent with those from JT gravity, with additional contributions from the intrinsic gravity of the branes. For fluctuating branes, we find that the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match between bulk and brane perspectives at the linear order of fluctuation. The CV results exhibit $\frac{\phi_h^2}{\phi_0}$ corrections from fluctuations, consistent with the findings in previous work. Moreover, the CA results reveal an additional constant term in the fluctuating branes case. We provide an interpretation of this in terms of gravitational edge mode effects. The distinct corrections arising from fluctuations in the CA and CV proposals suggest that the CV proposal is more sensitive to geometric details. Furthermore, we discuss these results in relation to Lloyd's bound on complexity, their general time dependence, and the effects of fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <title>DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological "wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Epoch of Reionization Signal with 3D U-Net Neural Networks Using Data-driven Systematic Effect Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images in South Celestial Pole (SCP) field and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole (NCP) field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression (GPR), and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1752 hours of integration time, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal noise and excess variances with observations up to 4380 hours and 13140 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively. The incoherence of excess variances in the frequency direction can greatly affect deep learning to extract 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>SgrA* spin and mass estimates through the detection of multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the parameter estimation accuracy that can be achieved for the mass and spin of SgrA$^\ast$, the SMBH in our Galactic Center, by detecting multiple extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs). XMRIs are formed by brown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus emitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future space-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest the presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them some of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our analysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\approx10$), high-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple sources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by approximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing a small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic Center, we estimate that almost 80\,\% of the detectable XMRIs orbiting SgrA$^\ast$ will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an $\mathrm{SNR}\in [10,100]$. The remaining $\sim$20\,\% of the sources have an $\mathrm{SNR}\in [100,1000]$ and eccentricities ranging from 0.25 to 0.92. Additionally, some XMRIs with high SNR are far from being circular. These loud sources with $\mathrm{SNR}\approx 1000$ can have eccentricities as high as $e\approx0.7$; although their detection chances are low, representing $\lesssim$2\,\% of the detectable sources, their presence is not ruled out.</description>

      <title>Long-term impact of the magnetic-field strength on the evolution and electromagnetic emission by neutron-star merger remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential to understand the complex physics accompanying the merger of binary systems of neutron stars. However, these simulations become computationally challenging when they have to model the merger remnants on timescales over which secular phenomena, such as the launching of magnetically driven outflows, develop. To tackle these challenges, we have recently developed a hybrid approach that combines, via a hand-off transition, a fully general-relativistic code (FIL) with a more efficient code making use of the conformally flat approximation (BHAC+). We here report important additional developments of BHAC+ consisting of the inclusion of gravitational-wave radiation-reaction contributions and of higher-order formulations of the equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Both improvements have allowed us to explore BNS merger remnants with high accuracy and over timescales that would have been computationally prohibitive otherwise. More specifically, we have investigated the impact of the magnetic-field strength on the long-term (i.e., $\sim 200\,{\rm ms}$) and high-resolution (i.e., $150\,{\rm m}$) evolutions of the "magnetar" resulting from the merger of two neutron stars with a realistic equation of state. In this way, and for sufficiently large magnetic fields, we observe the weakening or suppression of differential rotation and the generation of magnetic flares in the outer layers of the remnant. These flares, driven mostly by the Parker instability, are responsible for intense and collimated Poynting flux outbursts and mass ejections. This novel phenomenology offers the possibility of seeking corresponding signatures from the observations of short gamma-ray bursts and hence revealing the existence of a long-lived strongly magnetized remnant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The potential in the axion direction is almost exactly flat during inflation, hence, the axion field remains nearly massless. In this paper, we develop a generalized class of such models, where the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is preserved, but the axion acquires a large mass and becomes strongly stabilized during inflation, which eliminates isocurvature perturbations in this scenario. Inflation in such two-field models occurs as in the single-field $\alpha$-attractors and leads to the same cosmological predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of the cosmological model and the mass and redshift distributions of the binary black hole population with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of constraining the mass and redshift distributions of binary black hole systems jointly with the underlying cosmological model using one year of observations of the Einstein Telescope. To this aim, we fixed the underlying cosmological model to a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, then we considered the mass distribution given by a smoothed power law, and the redshift distributions given by the Madau-Dickinson model. We built mock catalogs with different SNR thresholds, and finally inferred astrophysical and cosmological parameters jointly adopting a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We found that as the SNR threshold decreases, the precision on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$, improves significantly due to the increased number of detectable events at high redshift. However, degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters exist and evolve with the SNR threshold. Finally, we showed that one year of observations will serve to reconstruct the mass distribution with its features. Conversely, the redshift distribution will be poorly constrained and will need more observations to improve.</description>

      <title>Power Spectra in Double-Field Inflation Using Renormalization-Group Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A perturbative strategy for inflation described by two-inflaton fields is developed using a mathematical analogy with the renormalization-group. Two small quantities, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, corresponding to standard slow-roll parameters are defined and systematic expansions of all inflationary quantities in terms of powers of $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are found. No other slow-roll parameters are needed. To illustrate this perturbative method in the multi-field context, we adopt a simple two-inflaton model with quadratic potentials in the parameter range where both fields contribute similarly to the dynamics of inflation. The model, even though it is not a viable alternative for phenomenological description of the inflationary period, nicely illustrates subtleties of the perturbative approach. In particular, this method allows us to derive two independent gauge-invariant scalar perturbations that are conserved in the superhorizon limit, overcoming typical problems that emerge in multi-field inflation. Furthermore, it is possible to perform nonperturbative resummations that allow to study the model in a true multi-field regime. We derive tensor and scalar power spectra to the next-to-next-to-leading and next-to-leading orders, respectively, as well as their spectral indices. The hierarchy between the two scalar perturbations allows us to single out the dominant entry of the scalar power-spectrum matrix. Modifications due to the second inflaton occur already at the leading order. Finally, we explain why the quadratic two-inflaton model is not compatible with the present experimental constraints even though non-trivial corrections to scalar perturbations do emerge.</description>

      <title>Resolving the S8 tension with the Lambda Prime ($\Lambda'$) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $S_8$ parameter, which quantifies the amplitude of matter fluctuations on scales of $8h^{-1}$ Mpc, has been a source of tension between weak lensing surveys (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC) and the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. This discrepancy challenges the standard ${\Lambda}$CDM model and has become one of the most significant tensions in modern cosmology. The ${\Lambda'}$ model offers a potential resolution by introducing modifications to the cosmic growth history through alterations to the gravitational sector. The alterations involve including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations which introduce a time dependent factor yielding a time varying cosmological constant ${\Lambda'}=(1-{\alpha(t)^2}{\Lambda_{DE}}\frac{{\rho}_g}{\rho_{DE}}$ and subsequently the evolution of the cosmos. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy density. In this study we analyze results from six surveys and compare the results for $w_a$ and $w_0$ with the ${\Lambda'}$ model. We also find ${\sigma}_8={0.750}_{-0.020}^{+0.020}$ , $S_8={0.788}$. These values are closer to some low $S_8$ measurements from weak lensing surveys (e.g DES, KiDS), which report $S_8 \approx 0.76-0.78$, suggesting that the model may alleviate the $S_8$ tension. High values of ${\alpha(t)}$ in the late universe are the cause of suppressed structure formation and low values of ${\Lambda'}$. The late universe in the ${\Lambda'}$ model is effectively or apparently 5-10% younger than in ${\Lambda}$CDM which translates to $H_0={72.734}_{-1.687}^{+1.687}$ km/s/Mpc, which is in agreement with late universe probes. ${\Lambda'}$ is classified under the dynamical dark energy models, however unlike alternatives, it does not invoke exotic particles nor phantom energy.</description>

Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>
