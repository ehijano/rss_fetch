      <title>LingxiDiagBench: A Multi-Agent Framework for Benchmarking LLMs in Chinese Psychiatric Consultation and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, but the shortage of psychiatrists and the inherent subjectivity of interview-based diagnosis create substantial barriers to timely and consistent mental-health assessment. Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench.</description>

Abstract: Since the early 2000s, control of multiagent systems has attracted significant research interest, with applications ranging from natural collective behaviors and social dynamics to engineered systems such as autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, and smart grids. Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.
  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.
  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends. The authors appreciate feedback from readers to further improve the content of the book.</description>

      <title>Tiny Moves: Game-based Hypothesis Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>SciDataCopilot: An Agentic Data Preparation Framework for AGI-driven Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current landscape of AI for Science (AI4S) is predominantly anchored in large-scale textual corpora, where generative AI systems excel at hypothesis generation, literature search, and multi-modal reasoning. However, a critical bottleneck for accelerating closed-loop scientific discovery remains the utilization of raw experimental data. Characterized by extreme heterogeneity, high specificity, and deep domain expertise requirements, raw data possess neither direct semantic alignment with linguistic representations nor structural homogeneity suitable for a unified embedding space. The disconnect prevents the emerging class of Artificial General Intelligence for Science (AGI4S) from effectively interfacing with the physical reality of experimentation. In this work, we extend the text-centric AI-Ready concept to Scientific AI-Ready data paradigm, explicitly formalizing how scientific data is specified, structured, and composed within a computational workflow. To operationalize this idea, we propose SciDataCopilot, an autonomous agentic framework designed to handle data ingestion, scientific intent parsing, and multi-modal integration in a end-to-end manner. By positioning data readiness as a core operational primitive, the framework provides a principled foundation for reusable, transferable systems, enabling the transition toward experiment-driven scientific general intelligence. Extensive evaluations across three heterogeneous scientific domains show that SciDataCopilot improves efficiency, scalability, and consistency over manual pipelines, with up to 30$\times$ speedup in data preparation.</description>

      <title>CoMMa: Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents From A Game-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks have broadened the ability to tackle oncology decision support tasks that require reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data. We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.</description>

      <title>VLM-Guided Iterative Refinement for Surgical Image Segmentation with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.</description>

      <title>Collective Behavior of AI Agents: the Case of Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large scale data analysis of Moltbook, a Reddit-style social media platform exclusively populated by AI agents. Analyzing over 369,000 posts and 3.0 million comments from approximately 46,000 active agents, we find that AI collective behavior exhibits many of the same statistical regularities observed in human online communities: heavy-tailed distributions of activity, power-law scaling of popularity metrics, and temporal decay patterns consistent with limited attention dynamics. However, we also identify key differences, including a sublinear relationship between upvotes and discussion size that contrasts with human behavior. These findings suggest that, while individual AI agents may differ fundamentally from humans, their emergent collective dynamics share structural similarities with human social systems.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changes in Congested On-Ramp Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic. The code for MARL-MASS is available with an open-source licence at https://github.com/hkbharath/MARL-MASS</description>

      <title>Resilient Topology-Aware Coordination for Dynamic 3D UAV Networks under Node Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 3D Aerial-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), ensuring continuous service coverage under unexpected hardware failures is critical for mission-critical applications. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests. Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis, including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation. Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important limitations and areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Virtual Force-Based Routing of Modular Agents on a Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular vehicles present a novel area of academic and industrial interest in the field of multi-agent systems. Modularity allows vehicles to connect and disconnect with each other mid-transit which provides a balance between efficiency and flexibility when solving complex and large scale tasks in urban or aerial transportation. This paper details a generalized scheme to route multiple modular agents on a graph to a predetermined set of target nodes. The objective is to visit all target nodes while incurring minimum resource expenditure. Agents that are joined together will incur the equivalent cost of a single agent, which is motivated by the logistical benefits of traffic reduction and increased fuel efficiency. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel algorithm that seeks to balance the optimality of the path that every single module takes and the cost benefit of joining modules. Our approach models the agents and targets as point charges, where the modules take the path of highest attractive force from its target node and neighboring agents. We validate our approach by simulating multiple modular agents along real-world transportation routes in the road network of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA. The proposed method easily exceeds the available benchmarks and illustrates the benefits of modularity in multi-target planning problems.</description>

Abstract: People care about decision outcomes and how decisions get made, both when making decisions and reflecting on decisions. But formalizing the full range of normative concerns that drive decisions is an open challenge. We introduce Axiomatic Choice as a framework for making and evaluating decisions based on formal normative statements about decisions. These statements, or axioms, capture a wide array of desiderata, e.g., ethical constraints, beyond the typical treatment in Social Choice. Using our model of axioms and decisions we define key properties and introduce a taxonomy of axioms which may be of general interest. We then use these properties and our taxonomy to define the Decision-Evaluation Paradox, formalize the concepts of transparency and deception in explaining and justifying decisions, and reveal the limits of existing methods using axioms to make decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.</description>

      <title>Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.</description>

      <title>CyberExplorer: Benchmarking LLM Offensive Security Capabilities in a Real-World Attacking Simulation Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world offensive security operations are inherently open-ended: attackers explore unknown attack surfaces, revise hypotheses under uncertainty, and operate without guaranteed success. Existing LLM-based offensive agent evaluations rely on closed-world settings with predefined goals and binary success criteria. To address this gap, we introduce CyberExplorer, an evaluation suite with two core components: (1) an open-environment benchmark built on a virtual machine hosting 40 vulnerable web services derived from real-world CTF challenges, where agents autonomously perform reconnaissance, target selection, and exploitation without prior knowledge of vulnerability locations; and (2) a reactive multi-agent framework supporting dynamic exploration without predefined plans. CyberExplorer enables fine-grained evaluation beyond flag recovery, capturing interaction dynamics, coordination behavior, failure modes, and vulnerability discovery signals-bridging the gap between benchmarks and realistic multi-target attack scenarios.</description>
