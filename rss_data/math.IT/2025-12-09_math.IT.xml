      <title>Hybrid Beamfocusing Design for RSMA-Enabled Near-Field Wideband Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks will utilize extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) over high-frequency bands, which, however, produce near-field spherical wavefronts and spatial wideband effects. To exploit and mitigate these, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled transmit scheme for wideband near-field communications (NFC). Our solution leverages true-time-delay (TTD)-based hybrid beamfocusing architectures to mitigate spatial wideband effect and reduce radio frequency chain requirements. The objective is to maximize the minimum rate by jointly optimizing frequency-dependent analog beamfocusing, frequency-independent analog beamfocusing, digital beamfocusing, and common rate allocation. To solve this complicated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based iterative algorithm that partitions the variables into three blocks and then employs block coordinate descent (BCD) to optimize each block alternately. This algorithm is further extended to support the sub-connected TTD-based analog beamfocusing architectures. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that our transmit scheme: 1) effectively compensates for spatial wideband effect, addressing a critical challenge in wideband operation; 2) achieves performance comparable to full digital beamfocusing while maintaining lower hardware complexity; 3) achieves substantial performance gains over the other two benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Error Bounds for Causally Conditioned Directed Information Rates of Gaussian Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed information and its causally conditioned variations are often used to measure causal influences between random processes. In practice, these quantities must be measured from data. Non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimates are known for sequences over finite alphabets, but less is known for real-valued data. This paper examines the case in which the data are sequences of Gaussian vectors. We provide an explicit formula for causally conditioned directed information rate based on optimal prediction and define an estimator based on this formula. We show that our estimator gives an error of order $O\left(N^{-1/2}\log(N)\right)$ with high probability, where $N$ is the total sample size.</description>

      <title>Performance Bounds on Pliable Index Coding Using Absent Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise bounds on the optimal broadcast rate for a few classes of pliable-index-coding instances. Unlike the majority of currently solved instances, which belong to a special class where all receivers with a certain side-information cardinality are either present or absent, we consider more general instances without this constraint. We devise a novel algorithm that constructs a decoding chain by iteratively adding a message that can be decoded by a receiver whose side information is already in the chain. If the decoding chain cannot proceed due to the absence of a receiver with the required messages, we skip a message by adding it to the chain regardless. We prove that a lower bound on the optimal broadcast rate is a function of the number of skipped messages, across all possible decoding choices of the receivers and any realisation of the algorithm for each decoding choice. While this result is not computationally feasible in isolation, it serves as a basis for deriving explicit lower bounds on the broadcast rate for specific classes of pliable-index-coding instances. These lower bounds depend on the number of absent receivers or the pattern of their side-information sets. Specifically, we explicitly characterise the optimal broadcast rate for instances with up to and including four absent receivers with any side-information pattern, as well as instances where the side-information sets are nested in particular ways.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected UAV in Complex Environment with Partial CKM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an increasingly important role in future wireless networks. To facilitate the reliable navigation for cellular-connected UAVs, channel knowledge map (CKM) is considered a promising approach capable of tackling the non-negligible co-channel interference resulting from the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability of air-ground (AG) channels. Nevertheless, due to measurement constraints and the aging of information, CKM is usually incomplete and needs to be regularly updated to capture the dynamic nature of complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory design strategy in which UAV navigation and CKM completion are incorporated into a common framework, enabling mutual benefits for both tasks. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV deployed in an urban environment measures the radio information during its flight and completes the CKM with Kriging interpolation. Based on the method of grid discretization and spherical approximation, a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The problem falls into the category of combinatorial mathematics and is essentially equivalent to determining an optimum sequence of grid points to traverse. Through proper mathematical manipulation, the problem is reformulated as variants of two classic models in graph theory, namely the shortest-path problem (SPP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two navigation strategies based on the two different models are proposed and thoroughly compared based on numerical results to provide implementable methods for engineering practice and reveal the trade-offs between UAV navigation and CKM completion. Simulation results reveal that the proposed navigation strategies can quickly expand the Pareto boundary of the problem and approach the performance of fully-known CKM.</description>

      <title>Algebra in Algorithmic Coding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the notion and history of error-correcting codes and the algorithms needed to make them effective in information transmission. We then give some basic as well as more modern constructions of, and algorithms for, error-correcting codes that depend on relatively simple elements of applied algebra. While the role of algebra in the constructions of codes has been widely acknowledged in texts and other writings, the role in the design of algorithms is often less widely understood, and this survey hopes to reduce this difference to some extent.</description>

      <title>Improved Interactive Protocol for Synchronizing From Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data synchronization is a fundamental problem with applications in diverse fields such as cloud storage, genomics, and distributed systems. This paper addresses the challenge of synchronizing two files, one of which is a subsequence of the other and related through a constant rate of deletions, using an improved communication protocol. Building upon prior work, we integrate advanced multi-deletion correction codes into an existing baseline protocol, which previously relied on single-deletion correction. Our proposed protocol reduces communication cost by leveraging more general partitioning techniques as well as multi-deletion error correction. We derive a generalized upper bound on the expected number of transmitted bits, applicable to a broad class of deletion correction codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline in communication cost. These findings establish the efficacy of the improved protocol in achieving low-redundancy synchronization in scenarios where deletion errors occur.</description>

      <title>Cell-free ISAC for Drone Detection Considering Coverage and Age of Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing presence of unauthorized drones poses significant threats to public safety, underscoring the need for aerial surveillance solutions. This work proposes a cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework enabling drone detection within the existing communication network infrastructure, while maintaining communication services. The system exploits the spatial diversity and coordination of distributed access points (APs) in a cell-free massive MIMO architecture to detect aerial passive targets. To evaluate sensing performance, we introduce two key metrics: age of sensing (AoS), capturing the freshness of sensing information, and sensing coverage. The proposed AoS metric includes not only the transmission delays as in the existing models, but also the processing for sensing and networking delay, which are critical in dynamic environments like drone detection. We introduce an ambiguity parameter quantifying the similarity between the target-to-receiver channels for two hotspots and develop a novel network configuration strategy, including hotspot grouping, AP clustering, and sensing pilot assignment, leveraging simultaneous multi-point sensing to minimize AoS. Our results show that the best trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage is achieved when the number of hotspots sharing the same time/frequency resource matches the number of sensing pilots, indicating ambiguity as the primary factor limiting the sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes for Insertion-Deletion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds and optimal constructions of pure quantum locally recoverable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating the concept of locality into quantum information theory, quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs) have been proposed, motivated by their potential applications in large-scale quantum data storage and their relevance to quantum LDPC codes. Despite the progress in optimal quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), optimal constructions of qLRCs remain largely unexplored, partly due to the fact that the existing bounds for qLRCs are not sufficiently tight. In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters. Based on these constructions, we further identify many infinite families of optimal qLRCs with respect to different bounds, achieving code lengths much larger than those of known optimal qLRCs.</description>

      <title>Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining: Scaling Localization Models with Unlabeled Wireless Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor localization offers significant promise for applications such as indoor navigation, augmented reality, and pervasive computing. While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Linear codes over $\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}$ with mixed-alphabet defining sets and their Gray images: Constructions of projective few-weight, distance-optimal and minimal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R}=\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}\times \mathbb{F}_q$ be the mixed alphabet ring. In this paper, we construct four infinite families of linear codes over the ring $\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}$ whose defining sets are certain nonempty subsets of $\mathcal{R}^m$ associated with three simplicial complexes of $\mathbb{F}_q^m,$ each possessing a single maximal element. We explicitly determine the parameters and Lee weight distributions of these codes. We also study their Gray images and obtain three infinite families of few weight, near Griesmer, distance optimal and minimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters. We also provide two constructions of infinite families of projective few weight codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters, and observe that these codes are self orthogonal for $q=2$ or $3.$ Additionally, we obtain two infinite families of binary distance optimal projective codes and an infinite family of dimension optimal projective codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters. Apart from this, we construct an infinite family of quaternary projective $3$-weight codes whose non zero Hamming weights sum to $\frac{9}{4}$ times the code length, which give rise to strongly walk regular graphs. As an application of our newly constructed minimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$, we examine the minimal access structures of Massey's secret sharing schemes based on their duals and determine the number of dictatorial participants in these schemes. Finally, we investigate the locality properties of our newly constructed projective codes.</description>

      <title>Dualities of dihedral and generalised quaternion codes and applications to quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of $q$ elements, for some prime power $q$, and let $G$ be a finite group. A (left) group code, or simply a $G$-code, is a (left) ideal of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $\gcd(q,n)=1$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ with $\gcd(q,4n)=1$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach.</description>

      <title>Orbit recovery under the rigid motions group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbit recovery problem under the rigid-motion group SE(n), where the objective is to reconstruct an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations subjected to unknown rotations and translations. This problem is fundamental in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology.
  Our main theoretical contribution is bounding the sample complexity of this problem. We show that if the d-th order moment under the rotation group SO(n) uniquely determines the signal orbit, then orbit recovery under SE(n) is achievable with $N\gtrsim \sigma^{2d+4}$ samples as the noise variance $\sigma^2 \to \infty$. The key technical insight is that the d-th order SO(n) moments can be explicitly recovered from (d+2)-order SE(n) autocorrelations, enabling us to transfer known results from the rotation-only setting to the rigid-motion case. We further harness this result to derive a matching bound to the sample complexity of the multi-target detection model that serves as an abstract framework for electron-microscopy-based technologies in structural biology, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).
  Beyond theory, we present a provable computational pipeline for rigid-motion orbit recovery in three dimensions. Starting from rigid-motion autocorrelations, we extract the SO(3) moments and demonstrate successful reconstruction of a 3-D macromolecular structure. Importantly, this algorithmic approach is valid at any noise level, suggesting that even very small macromolecules, long believed to be inaccessible using structural biology electron-microscopy-based technologies, may, in principle, be reconstructed given sufficient data.</description>

Abstract: The diamond relay channel, where a source communicates with a destination via two parallel relays, is one of the canonical models for cooperative communications. We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds. These results demonstrate that neural CF can scale to multi-relay systems while maintaining both performance and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation for OTFS systems using Sparse Bayesian Learning with Adaptive Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a two-dimensional modulation scheme designed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, exhibiting superior performance over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in environments with high Doppler frequency shifts. We investigated the channel estimation in the DD domain of OTFS systems, modeling it as a sparse signal recovery problem. Subsequently, within the existing sparse Bayesian learning framework, we proposed an adaptive Bayesian threshold-based active denoising mechanism. Combined with inverse-free sparse Bayesian learning, this effectively addresses the pseudo-peak issue in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios while maintaining low complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing channel estimation algorithms in terms of anti-noise performance and complexity.</description>

      <title>Learning Invariant Graph Representations Through Redundant Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning invariant graph representations for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains challenging because the learned representations often retain spurious components. To address this challenge, this work introduces a new tool from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that goes beyond classical information-theoretic measures. We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework.</description>

      <title>Beamspace Dimensionality Reduction for Massive MU-MIMO: Geometric Insights and Information-Theoretic Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamspace dimensionality reduction, a classical tool in array processing, has been shown in recent work to significantly reduce computational complexity and training overhead for adaptive reception in massive multiuser (MU) MIMO. For sparse multipath propagation and uniformly spaced antenna arrays, beamspace transformation, or application of a spatial FFT, concentrates the energy of each user into a small number of spatial frequency bins. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) detection performed in parallel using a beamspace window of small, fixed size for each user, even as the number of antennas and users scale up, while being robust to moderate variations in the relative powers of the users. In this paper, we develop a fundamental geometric understanding of this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' in a regime in which zero-forcing solutions do not exist. For simplified channel models, we show that, when we enforce a suitable separation in spatial frequency between users, the interference power falling into a desired user's beamspace window of size $W$ concentrates into a number of dominant eigenmodes smaller than $W$, with the desired user having relatively small projection onto these modes. Thus, linear suppression of dominant interference modes can be accomplished with small noise enhancement. We show that similar observations apply for MIMO-OFDM over wideband multipath channels synthesized from measured 28 GHz data. We propose, and evaluate via information-theoretic benchmarks, per-subcarrier reduced dimension beamspace LMMSE in this setting.</description>

      <title>Interpretive Efficiency: Information-Geometric Foundations of Data Usefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability is central to trustworthy machine learning, yet existing metrics rarely quantify how effectively data support an interpretive representation. We propose Interpretive Efficiency, a normalized, task-aware functional that measures the fraction of task-relevant information transmitted through an interpretive channel. The definition is grounded in five axioms ensuring boundedness, Blackwell-style monotonicity, data-processing stability, admissible invariance, and asymptotic consistency. We relate the functional to mutual information and derive a local Fisher-geometric expansion, then establish asymptotic and finite-sample estimation guarantees using standard empirical-process tools. Experiments on controlled image and signal tasks demonstrate that the measure recovers theoretical orderings, exposes representational redundancy masked by accuracy, and correlates with robustness, making it a practical, theory-backed diagnostic for representation design.</description>

      <title>Non-Equiprobable Signaling for Wireless Channels Subject to Mobility and Delay Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter describes how to improve performance of OFDM systems by combining non-equiprobable signaling with low density parity check (LDPC) coding. We partition a standard QAM constellation into annular subconstellations of equal size, and we implement non-equiprobable signaling through a shaping code which selects subconstellations with large average energy less frequently than subconstellations with small average energy. In equiprobable signaling, the LDPC code selects a signal point from the inner subconstellation. In non-equiprobable signaling this inner signal point has a representative in each subconstellation and the shaping code selects the representative for transmission. It is possible to use standard QAM constellations to achieve any desired fractional bit rate with this method of shaping the energy distribution of the transmitted signal. We describe how to combine coding and shaping by integrating shaping into the calculation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) necessary for decoding LDPC codes. We present simulation results for non-equiprobable transmission at $1.5$ bits/symbol on a representative Veh-A channel showing gains of $4$ dB at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$. As the transmission rate increases, the gains from non-equiprobable signaling diminish, but we show through simulation that they are still significant for $16$-QAM.</description>

      <title>FlatFormer: A Flat Transformer Knowledge Tracing Model Based on Cognitive Bias Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) models face a critical ``Performance-Complexity Trap'': capturing complex cognitive dynamics like learning sessions and memory decay typically requires deep hierarchical architectures, which incur prohibitive computational costs for real-time deployment. To resolve this, we propose FlatFormer, a streamlined architecture based on the novel design paradigm of ``Information Injection over Structural Stacking.'' Unlike parameter-heavy hierarchical models, FlatFormer leverages a standard flat Transformer augmented with two lightweight injection mechanisms: (i) a hybrid input encoding strategy combining learnable session identifiers with fixed sinusoidal step embeddings; and (ii) a pre-computed power-law bias integrated directly into attention logits to explicitly model the forgetting curve. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets (e.g., EdNet, Junyi) show that FlatFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, on the EdNet dataset, compared to the strongest hierarchical baseline (HiTSKT), its absolute AUC increased by 8.3%, while using less than 15% of parameters, and inference speed was about three times faster. These results validate that high cognitive fidelity does not necessitate architectural complexity.</description>

      <title>Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</description>

      <title>The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design under Costly Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal auction design in an independent private values environment where bidders can endogenously -- but at a cost -- improve information about their own valuations. The optimal mechanism is two-stage: at stage-1 bidders register an information acquisition plan and pay a transfer; at stage-2 they bid, and allocation and payments are determined. We show that the revenue-optimal stage-2 rule is the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) mechanism, while stage-1 transfers implement the optimal screening of types and absorb information rents consistent with incentive compatibility and participation. By committing to VCG ex post, the pre-auction information game becomes a potential game, so equilibrium information choices maximize expected welfare; the stage-1 fee schedule then transfers an optimal amount of payoff without conditioning on unverifiable cost scales. The design is robust to asymmetric primitives and accommodates a wide range of information technologies, providing a simple implementation that unifies efficiency and optimal revenue in environments with endogenous information acquisition.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Generalized Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Extension to Multicast Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</description>

Abstract: Single Input-Multiple Output (SIMO) systems are key enablers of high data rates in the next generation wireless communications. However in SIMO systems, channel estimation and equalization are challenging particularly in the presence of rapidly changing channels. The high pilot overhead required for channel estimation can reduce the system throughput for large antenna configuration. In this paper, we provide an iterative matrix decomposition algorithm for near-pilotless or blind decoding of SIMO signals, in a single carrier system with frequency domain equalization. This novel approach replaces the standard equalization and estimates both the transmitted data and the channel without the knowledge of any prior distributions, by making use of only one pilot. Our simulations demonstrate improved performance, in terms of error rates, compared to the more widely used pilot-based Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study the information-theoretical limits of oblivious transfer. This work also investigates the problem of oblivious transfer over a noisy multiple access channel involving two non-colluding senders and a single receiver. The channel model is characterized by correlations among the parties, with the parties assumed to be either honest-but-curious or, in the receiver's case, potentially malicious. At first, we study the information-theoretical limits of oblivious transfer between two parties and extend it to the multiple access channel model. We propose a multiparty protocol for honest-but-curious parties where the general multiple access channel is reduced to a certain correlation. In scenarios where the receiver is malicious, the protocol achieves an achievable rate region.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Then-Beamforming: Robust Transmission Design for RIS-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the warden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain due to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISACC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISACC systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Power Amplifier-Resilient Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Joint Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter analyzes the effects of power amplifiers (PAs) on the downlink of cell-free massive MIMO systems. We model signal transmission incorporating nonlinear PA distortion and derive a unified spectral efficiency (SE) expression applicable to arbitrary precoding schemes. To combat PA-induced performance degradation, a joint optimization approach for user association and max-min power control is proposed. Furthermore, a low-complexity alternative is developed to approximate the joint optimization with reduced computational overhead. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed approaches over conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Erasure-prone Quantum Storage with Erasure-prone Entanglement Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</description>

      <title>Information Physics of Intelligence: Unifying Logical Depth and Entropy under Thermodynamic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This "Energy-Time-Space" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Han's Fourier Entropy-Influence Inequality via an Information-Theoretic Proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We strengthen Han's Fourier entropy-influence inequality $$ H[\widehat{f}] \leq C_{1}I(f) + C_{2}\sum_{i\in [n]}I_{i}(f)\ln\frac{1}{I_{i}(f)} $$ originally proved for $\{-1,1\}$-valued Boolean functions with $C_{1}=3+2\ln 2$ and $C_{2}=1$. We show, by a short information-theoretic proof, that it in fact holds with sharp constants $C_{1}=C_{2}=1$ for all real-valued Boolean functions of unit $L^{2}$-norm, thereby establishing the inequality as an elementary structural property of Shannon entropy and influence.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Approximation Factor in Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.05876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following problem: given two arbitrary densities $q_1,q_2$ and a sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is closer to $p$ in total variation.
  A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}= \min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3.
  We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g.\ a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup.
  We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed to vanishing error. In this work we characterize this task in a near-tight manner in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering the previous vanishing-error asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and provide methods for cardinality bounds in the smooth entropy calculus. We also introduce entangled state versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling. This provides a strong characterization of this network task in the one-shot, quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of bosonic Gaussian thermal states</title>

Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures, Kubo-Mori, and $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Multi-head Transformers Provably Learn Symbolic Multi-step Reasoning via Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, understandings of the underlying mechanisms by which they acquire these abilities through training remain limited, particularly from a theoretical standpoint. This work investigates how transformers learn to solve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought processes, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks: a backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to the root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements two-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then reversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer transformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to unseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward reasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and coordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive path. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained transformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures. Moreover, they offer insights into the emergence of reasoning abilities, suggesting that when tasks are structured to take intermediate chain-of-thought steps, even shallow multi-head transformers can effectively solve problems that would otherwise require deeper architectures.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory of Finite Abstractions and their Fundamental Scalability Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results on their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the information theory of lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems. Rate measures abstraction size, while distortion describes accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum achievable abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and the abstraction size; and vice-versa a lower bound on the minimum size, for given distortion. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through trajectory entropy. We demonstrate its tightness on some dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how this new theory enables constructing minimal abstractions, optimizing the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system.</description>

      <title>Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.</description>
