      <title>Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the Long-Tail Adjusted Next POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yukayo/LoTNext.</description>

      <title>Towards Truss-Based Temporal Community Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying communities from temporal networks facilitates the understanding of potential dynamic relationships among entities, which has already received extensive applications. However, existing methods primarily rely on lower-order connectivity (e.g., temporal edges) to capture the structural and temporal cohesiveness of the community, often neglecting higher-order temporal connectivity, which leads to sub-optimal results. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a novel temporal community model named maximal-truss (MDT). This model emphasizes maximal temporal support, ensuring all edges are connected by a sequence of triangles with elegant temporal properties. To search the MDT containing the user-initiated query node q (q-MDT), we first design a powerful local search framework with some effective pruning strategies. This approach aims to identify the solution from the small temporal subgraph which is expanded from q. To further improve the performance on large graphs, we build the temporal trussness index (TT-index) for all edges. Leveraging the TT-index allows us to efficiently search high-probability target subgraphs instead of performing a full search across the entire input graph. Empirical results on nine real-world networks and seven competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability</description>

      <title>Heuristic-based Dynamic Leiden Algorithm for Efficient Tracking of Communities on Evolving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection, or clustering, identifies groups of nodes in a graph that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. Given the size and dynamic nature of real-world graphs, efficient community detection is crucial for tracking evolving communities, enhancing our understanding and management of complex systems. The Leiden algorithm, which improves upon the Louvain algorithm, efficiently detects communities in large networks, producing high-quality structures. However, existing multicore dynamic community detection algorithms based on Leiden are inefficient and lack support for tracking evolving communities. This technical report introduces the first implementations of parallel Naive-dynamic (ND), Delta-screening (DS), and Dynamic Frontier (DF) Leiden algorithms that efficiently track communities over time. Experiments on a 64-core AMD EPYC-7742 processor demonstrate that ND, DS, and DF Leiden achieve average speedups of 3.9x, 4.4x, and 6.1x, respectively, on large graphs with random batch updates compared to the Static Leiden algorithm, and these approaches scale at 1.4 - 1.5x for every thread doubling.</description>

      <title>Changes in Sentiments and User Engagement for 2024 U.S. Presidential Candidates After Biden's Withdrawal: An Analysis of TikTok Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 U.S. presidential election has sparked widespread online discussions about the presidential candidates. Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race and Kamala Harris's subsequent entry as the Democratic candidate likely alter the dynamics of these online discussions; yet, this hypothesis requires evidence. Here, we study how sentiments and user engagement in social media posts mentioning presidential candidates change after Biden's withdrawal. Our analysis is based on N=680,609 TikTok videos that have accumulated over 4 billion views, with more than 23 million comments, 31 million shares, and 335 million likes from November 1, 2023, to October 6, 2024. We find that: (i) Before Biden's withdrawal, video posts mentioning the Republican candidate (Donald Trump) have higher positive sentiment and lower negative sentiment compared to those mentioning the Democratic candidate (Joe Biden). (ii) Following Biden's withdrawal, positive sentiment in video posts mentioning the Democratic candidate (Kamala Harris) increases by 46.8%, while negative sentiment decreases by 52.0%. (iii) Regarding user engagement, before Biden's withdrawal, video posts mentioning the Democratic candidate have 64.9% higher odds of being shared and 39.5% higher odds of receiving likes compared to posts mentioning the Republican candidate, with similar odds of receiving comments. (iv) After Biden's withdrawal, the odds of being shared increase by 53.3%, and the odds of receiving likes increase by 77.4% in both video posts mentioning the Democratic candidate and video posts mentioning the Republican candidate. Our findings offer insights into how sentiments and user engagement in online posts about the 2024 U.S. presidential candidates shift following Biden's dropping out from the presidential race.</description>

      <title>Misleading Ourselves: How Disinformation Manipulates Sensemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informal sensemaking surrounding U.S. election processes has been fraught in recent years, due to the inherent uncertainty of elections, the complexity of election processes in the U.S., and to disinformation. Based on insights from qualitative analysis of election rumors spreading online in 2020 and 2022, we introduce the concept of manipulated sensemaking to describe how disinformation functions by disrupting online audiences ability to make sense of novel, uncertain, or ambiguous information. We describe how at the core of this disruption is the ability for disinformation to shape broad, underlying stories called deep stories which determine the frames we use to make sense of this novel information. Additionally, we explain how sensemakings orientation around plausible explanations over accurate explanations makes it vulnerable to manipulation. Lastly, we demonstrate how disinformed deep stories shape sensemaking not just for a single event, but for many events in the future.</description>

      <title>LangGFM: A Large Language Model Alone Can be a Powerful Graph Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently gained significant attention. However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</description>

      <title>DST-TransitNet: A Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Model for Scalable and Efficient Network-Wide Prediction of Station-Level Transit Ridership</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of public transit ridership is vital for efficient planning and management of transit in rapidly growing urban areas in Canada. Unexpected increases in passengers can cause overcrowded vehicles, longer boarding times, and service disruptions. Traditional time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA face limitations, particularly in short-term predictions and integration of spatial and temporal features. These models struggle with the dynamic nature of ridership patterns and often ignore spatial correlations between nearby stops. Deep Learning (DL) models present a promising alternative, demonstrating superior performance in short-term prediction tasks by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal features. However, challenges such as dynamic spatial feature extraction, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency, and ensuring scalability remain.
  This paper introduces DST-TransitNet, a hybrid DL model for system-wide station-level ridership prediction. This proposed model uses graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to dynamically integrate the changing temporal and spatial correlations within the stations. The model also employs a precise time series decomposition framework to enhance accuracy and interpretability. Tested on Bogota's BRT system data, with three distinct social scenarios, DST-TransitNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in precision, efficiency and robustness. Meanwhile, it maintains stability over long prediction intervals, demonstrating practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Transit Pulse: Utilizing Social Media as a Source for Customer Feedback and Information Extraction with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Users of the transit system flood social networks daily with messages that contain valuable insights crucial for improving service quality. These posts help transit agencies quickly identify emerging issues. Parsing topics and sentiments is key to gaining comprehensive insights to foster service excellence. However, the volume of messages makes manual analysis impractical, and standard NLP techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) fall short in nuanced interpretation. Traditional sentiment analysis separates topics and sentiments before integrating them, often missing the interaction between them. This incremental approach complicates classification and reduces analytical productivity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to extracting and analyzing transit-related information, including sentiment and sarcasm detection, identification of unusual system problems, and location data from social media. Our method employs Large Language Models (LLM), specifically Llama 3, for a streamlined analysis free from pre-established topic labels. To enhance the model's domain-specific knowledge, we utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), integrating external knowledge sources into the information extraction pipeline. We validated our method through extensive experiments comparing its performance with traditional NLP approaches on user tweet data from the real world transit system. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs to transform social media data analysis in the public transit domain, providing actionable insights and enhancing transit agencies' responsiveness by extracting a broader range of information.</description>

      <title>Crafting Tomorrow: The Influence of Design Choices on Fresh Content in Social Media Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in popularity of social media platforms, has resulted in millions of new, content pieces being created every day. This surge in content creation underscores the need to pay attention to our design choices as they can greatly impact how long content remains relevant. In today's landscape where regularly recommending new content is crucial, particularly in the absence of detailed information, a variety of factors such as UI features, algorithms and system settings contribute to shaping the journey of content across the platform. While previous research has focused on how new content affects users' experiences, this study takes a different approach by analyzing these decisions considering the content itself.
  Through a series of carefully crafted experiments we explore how seemingly small decisions can influence the longevity of content, measured by metrics like Content Progression (CVP) and Content Survival (CSR). We also emphasize the importance of recognizing the stages that content goes through underscoring the need to tailor strategies for each stage as a one size fits all approach may not be effective. Additionally we argue for a departure from traditional experimental setups in the study of content lifecycles, to avoid potential misunderstandings while proposing advanced techniques, to achieve greater precision and accuracy in the evaluation process.</description>

      <title>A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach for Fair Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fair graph clustering is crucial for ensuring equitable representation and treatment of diverse communities in network analysis. Traditional methods often ignore disparities among social, economic, and demographic groups, perpetuating biased outcomes and reinforcing inequalities. This study introduces fair graph clustering within the framework of the disparate impact doctrine, treating it as a joint optimization problem integrating clustering quality and fairness constraints. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we employ a semidefinite relaxation approach to approximate the underlying optimization problem. For up to medium-sized graphs, we utilize a singular value decomposition-based algorithm, while for larger graphs, we propose a novel algorithm based on the alternative direction method of multipliers. Unlike existing methods, our formulation allows for tuning the trade-off between clustering quality and fairness. Experimental results on graphs generated from the standard stochastic block model demonstrate the superiority of our approach in achieving an optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>The microscale organization of directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world complex systems are characterized by non-pairwise -- higher-order -- interactions among system's units, and can be effectively modeled as hypergraphs. Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework on empirical datasets, including Bitcoin transactions, metabolic networks, and citation data, revealing structural principles behind the organization of real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Community Detection for Locally Distributed Multiple Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern multi-layer networks are commonly stored and analyzed in a local and distributed fashion because of the privacy, ownership, and communication costs. The literature on the model-based statistical methods for community detection based on these data is still limited. This paper proposes a new method for consensus community detection and estimation in a multi-layer stochastic block model using locally stored and computed network data with privacy protection. A novel algorithm named privacy-preserving Distributed Spectral Clustering (ppDSC) is developed. To preserve the edges' privacy, we adopt the randomized response (RR) mechanism to perturb the network edges, which satisfies the strong notion of differential privacy. The ppDSC algorithm is performed on the squared RR-perturbed adjacency matrices to prevent possible cancellation of communities among different layers. To remove the bias incurred by RR and the squared network matrices, we develop a two-step bias-adjustment procedure. Then we perform eigen-decomposition on the debiased matrices, aggregation of the local eigenvectors using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation, and k-means clustering. We provide theoretical analysis on the statistical errors of ppDSC in terms of eigen-vector estimation. In addition, the blessings and curses of network heterogeneity are well-explained by our bounds.</description>

Abstract: Social learning, a fundamental process through which individuals shape their beliefs and perspectives via observation and interaction with others, is critical for the development of our society and the functioning of social governance. Prior works on social learning usually assume that the initial beliefs are given and focus on the update rule. With the recent proliferation of online social networks, there is an avalanche amount of information, which may significantly influence users' initial beliefs. In this paper, we use the rational inattention theory to model how agents acquire information to form initial beliefs and assess its influence on their adjustments in beliefs. Furthermore, we analyze the dynamic evolution of belief distribution among agents.

      <title>Pay Attention to Weak Ties: A Heterogeneous Multiplex Representation Learning Framework for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn effective node representations that significantly improve link prediction accuracy. However, most GNN-based link prediction algorithms are incompetent to predict weak ties connecting different communities. Most link prediction algorithms are designed for networks with only one type of relation between nodes but neglect the fact that many complex systems, including transportation and social networks, consisting of multi-modalities of interactions that correspond to different nature of interactions and dynamics that can be modeled as multiplex network, where different types of relation are represented in different layers. This paper proposes a Multi-Relations-aware Graph Neural Network (MRGNN) framework to learn effective node representations for multiplex networks and make more accurate link predictions, especially for weak ties. Specifically, our model utilizes an intra-layer node-level feature propagation process and an inter-layer representation merge process, which applies a simple yet effective logistic or semantic attention voting mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from different layers. Extensive experiments on four diversified multiplex networks show that MRGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art multiplex link prediction algorithms on overall prediction accuracy, and works pretty well on forecasting weak ties</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on ADHD Research: Knowledge Graph Construction with LLMs and Network Based Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a challenging disorder to study due to its complex symptomatology and diverse contributing factors. To explore how we can gain deeper insights on this topic, we performed a network analysis on a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) of ADHD, constructed by integrating scientific literature and clinical data with the help of cutting-edge large language models. The analysis, including k-core techniques, identified critical nodes and relationships that are central to understanding the disorder. Building on these findings, we curated a knowledge graph that is usable in a context-aware chatbot (Graph-RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling accurate and informed interactions. Our knowledge graph not only advances the understanding of ADHD but also provides a powerful tool for research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <title>Decoding Segregation: Navigating a century of segregation research across disciplines and introducing a bottom-up ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segregation is a widely recognised phenomenon with profound implications for societies worldwide. From political science and gender studies to anthropology and urban studies, it has garnered considerable attention across numerous scientific fields due to its multifaceted nature. However, what makes segregation such a far-reaching phenomenon? In fact, how many forms of segregation exist? Have different disciplines engaged in segregation research uncovered all its facets? This article systematically explores the landscape of segregation research spanning over a century. We analyzed 10,754 documents from the Scopus database to unveil the dynamics of the discovery of segregation forms through several findings. We identify (1) the exponential growth and increasing diversification of segregation forms, driven by combinatorial and exploratory work and increasing transdisciplinarity and intersectionality in research; (2) the evolution and structure of the field in hierarchies and clusters of segregation forms, revealing trends, persistence, and shifts over time; (3) the timing and geographical distribution of first publications on segregation forms, along with contextual variations across world regions and countries; (4) path dependencies in the historical and geographical shaping of segregation research; and (5) the structure of knowledge production. Aiming to contribute semantic organization to an increasingly complex field, we explore these findings to introduce a bottom-up ontology of segregation, marking the first comprehensive effort of its kind.</description>

      <title>Epidemic spreading in group-structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals involved in common group activities/settings -- e.g., college students that are enrolled in the same class and/or live in the same dorm -- are exposed to recurrent contacts of physical proximity. These contacts are known to mediate the spread of an infectious disease, however, it is not obvious how the properties of the spreading process are determined by the structure of and the interrelation among the group settings that are at the root of those recurrent interactions. Here, we show that reshaping the organization of groups within a population can be used as an effective strategy to decrease the severity of an epidemic. Specifically, we show that when group structures are sufficiently correlated -- e.g., the likelihood for two students living in the same dorm to attend the same class is sufficiently high -- outbreaks are longer but milder than for uncorrelated group structures. Also, we show that the effectiveness of interventions for disease containment increases as the correlation among group structures increases. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our findings by taking advantage of data about housing and attendance of students at the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. By appropriately optimizing the assignment of students to dorms based on their enrollment, we are able to observe a two- to five-fold reduction in the severity of simulated epidemic processes.</description>

      <title>Identifying built environment factors influencing driver yielding behavior at unsignalized intersections: A naturalistic open-source dataset collected in Minnesota</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many factors influence the yielding result of a driver-pedestrian interaction, including traffic volume, vehicle speed, roadway characteristics, etc. While individual aspects of these interactions have been explored, comprehensive, naturalistic studies, particularly those considering the built environment's influence on driver-yielding behavior, are lacking. To address this gap, our study introduces an extensive open-source dataset, compiled from video data at 18 unsignalized intersections across Minnesota. Documenting more than 3000 interactions, this dataset provides a detailed view of driver-pedestrian interactions and over 50 distinct contextual variables. The data, which covers individual driver-pedestrian interactions and contextual factors, is made publicly available at https://github.com/tianyi17/pedestrian_yielding_data_MN.
  Using logistic regression, we developed a classification model that predicts driver yielding based on the identified variables. Our analysis indicates that vehicle speed, the presence of parking lots, proximity to parks or schools, and the width of major road crossings significantly influence driver yielding at unsignalized intersections. Through our findings and by publishing one of the most comprehensive driver-pedestrian datasets in the United States, our study will support communities across Minnesota and the United States in their ongoing efforts to improve road safety for pedestrians and be helpful for automated vehicle design.</description>

      <title>Combining Rollout Designs and Clustering for Causal Inference under Low-order Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects under interference is pertinent to many real-world settings. Recent work with low-order potential outcomes models uses a rollout design to obtain unbiased estimators that require no interference network information. However, the required extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To address this, we propose a two-stage experiment that selects a sub-population in the first stage and restricts treatment rollout to this sub-population in the second stage. We explore the role of clustering in the first stage by analyzing the bias and variance of a polynomial interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Bias increases with the number of edges cut in the clustering of the interference network, but variance depends on qualities of the clustering that relate to homophily and covariate balance. There is a tension between clustering objectives that minimize the number of cut edges versus those that maximize covariate balance across clusters. Through simulations, we explore a bias-variance trade-off and compare the performance of the estimator under different clustering strategies.</description>

      <title>Authenticity and exclusion: social media algorithms and the dynamics of belonging in epistemic communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent philosophical work has explored how the social identity of knowers influences how their contributions are received, assessed, and credited. However, a critical gap remains regarding the role of technology in mediating and enabling communication within today's epistemic communities. This paper addresses this gap by examining how social media platforms and their recommendation algorithms shape the professional visibility and opportunities of researchers from minority groups. Using agent-based simulations, we investigate this question with respect to components of a widely used recommendation algorithm, and uncover three key patterns: First, these algorithms disproportionately harm the professional visibility of researchers from minority groups, creating systemic patterns of exclusion. Second, within these minority groups, the algorithms result in greater visibility for users who more closely resemble the majority group, incentivizing assimilation at the cost of professional invisibility. Third, even for topics that strongly align with minority identities, content created by minority researchers is less visible to the majority than similar content produced by majority users. Importantly, these patterns emerge, even though individual engagement with professional content is independent of group identity. These findings have significant implications for philosophical discussions on epistemic injustice and exclusion, and for policy proposals aimed at addressing these harms. More broadly, they call for a closer examination of the pervasive, but often neglected role of AI and data-driven technologies in shaping today's epistemic communities.</description>

      <title>Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to improve supply chain visibility and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data and data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 6%-50% (across datasets), and forecast future transactions, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11%-62%</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Scoping for Graph Neural Networks under Heterophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterophilous graphs, where dissimilar nodes tend to connect, pose a challenge for graph neural networks (GNNs) as their superior performance typically comes from aggregating homophilous information. Increasing the GNN depth can expand the scope (i.e., receptive field), potentially finding homophily from the higher-order neighborhoods. However, uniformly expanding the scope results in subpar performance since real-world web graphs often exhibit homophily disparity between nodes. An ideal way is personalized scopes, allowing nodes to have varying scope sizes. Existing methods typically add node-adaptive weights for each hop. Although expressive, they inevitably suffer from severe overfitting. To address this issue, we formalize personalized scoping as a separate scope classification problem that overcomes GNN overfitting in node classification. Specifically, we predict the optimal GNN depth for each node. Our theoretical and empirical analysis suggests that accurately predicting the depth can significantly enhance generalization. We further propose Adaptive Scope (AS), a lightweight approach that only participates in GNN inference. AS encodes structural patterns and predicts the depth to select the best model for each node's prediction. Experimental results show that AS is highly flexible with various GNN architectures across a wide range of datasets while significantly improving accuracy.</description>
