      <title>HypoGeneAgent: A Hypothesis Language Agent for Gene-Set Cluster Resolution Selection Using Perturb-seq Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve clustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology (GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses, accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness, low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity. When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated, context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaboration Increases Efficiency in Regulatory Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Investigational New Drug (IND) application preparation is time-intensive and expertise-dependent, slowing early clinical development. Objective: To evaluate whether a large language model (LLM) platform (AutoIND) can reduce first-draft composition time while maintaining document quality in regulatory submissions. Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written summaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly recorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously cleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory writers ($\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was assessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified categories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity, redundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a percentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or omission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL, omission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced initial drafting time by $\sim$97% (from $\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870 pages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2). Quality scores were 69.6\% and 77.9\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical regulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and clarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND drafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to submission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap for targeted model improvements.</description>

      <title>Triplication: an important component of the modern scientific method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scientific-study protocol, as defined here, is designed to deliver results from which inductive inference is allowed. In the nineteenth century, triplication was introduced into the plant sciences and Fisher's p&lt;0.05 rule (1925) was incorporated into a triple-result protocol designed to counter random/systematic errors. Aims here were to: (1) classify replication (including non-replicated) protocols; (2) assess their prevalence in plant-science studies published in 2017 for a defined variable construct; and (3) explore the theoretical rationale for the use of triplication. Methods: the plant sciences were surveyed and a protocol-prevalence report produced; association versus experimental proportions analyzed; and real-world-data proxies were used to show confidence-interval-width patterns with increasing replicate number. Results: triplication was found in ~70% of plant-science studies analyzed, with triple-result protocols observed in ~15%. Theoretical considerations showed that, even if systematic errors predominate, "square-root rules" sometimes apply, contributing to the predominance of triplication (real-world-data proxy examples given). Conclusions: Triplication was extensively applied in the studies analyzed and there are strong methodological reasons why (1) triplication, rather than duplication/quadruplication, is the most appropriate standard; (2) triple-result protocols are preferable to global averaging approaches; and (3) plant science methodological standards remain high, despite immense publication pressures.</description>

      <title>Estimating carbon pools in the shelf sea environment: reanalysis or model-informed machine learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but shelf sea observations for carbon pools are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an ensemble of neural networks (i.e. deep ensemble) to learn from a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES) sea environment, that when the deep ensemble trained on a model free run simulation is applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis outputs for carbon pools and additionally provide uncertainty information. We focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the deep ensembles for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could complement observations, wherever they are missing and/or highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>Snakes combine vertical and lateral bending to traverse uneven terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.08474v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial locomotion requires generating appropriate ground reaction forces which depend on substrate geometry and physical properties. The richness of positions and orientations of terrain features in the 3-D world gives limbless animals like snakes that can bend their body versatility to generate forces from different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies of how snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces with lateral contact points, little is known about whether and how much snakes use vertical body bending in combination with lateral bending in 3-D terrain. This lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to animals in stability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D environments. Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist corn snake traversed an uneven arena of blocks of random height variation 5 times its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain with perfect stability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse motion (11{\deg} slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through valleys with higher neighboring blocks, it did not prefer lateral bending. Among body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide propulsion, 52% were formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The combination of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources of propulsive forces available to limbless locomotors by utilizing various asperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements of contact forces are necessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the entire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain. These studies will open a path to new propulsive mechanisms for snake robots, potentially increasing the performance and versatility in 3-D terrain.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO: Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</description>
