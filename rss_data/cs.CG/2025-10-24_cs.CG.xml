      <title>A Tverberg-type problem of Kalai: Two negative answers to questions of Alon and Smorodinsky, and the power of disjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote the least integer $n$ such that every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a partition $P=P_1\cup\cdots\cup P_r$ with the property that for any choice of $s_i$-convex sets $C_i\supseteq P_i$ $(i\in[r])$ one necessarily has $\bigcap_{i=1}^r C_i\neq\emptyset$, where an $s_i$-convex set means a union of $s_i$ convex sets. A recent breakthrough by Alon and Smorodinsky establishes a general upper bound $f_r(d,s_1,\dots,s_r) = O(dr^2\log r \prod_{i=1}^r s_i\cdot \log(\prod_{i=1}^r s_i).$ Specializing to $r=2$ resolves the problem of Kalai from the 1970s. They further singled out two particularly intriguing questions: whether $f_{2}(2,s,s)$ can be improved from $O(s^2\log s)$ to $O(s)$, and whether $f_r(d,s,\ldots,s)\le Poly(r,d,s)$. We answer both in the negative by showing the exponential lower bound $f_{r}(d,s,\ldots,s)&gt; s^{r}$ for any $r\ge 2$, $s\ge 1$ and $d\ge 2r-2$, which matches the upper bound up to a multiplicative $\log{s}$ factor for sufficiently large $s$. Our construction combines a scalloped planar configuration with a direct product of regular $s$-gon on the high-dimensional torus $(\mathbb{S}^1)^{r-2}$. Perhaps surprisingly, if we additionally require that within each block the $s_i$ convex sets are pairwise disjoint, the picture changes markedly. Let $F_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote this disjoint-union variant of the extremal function. We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\log s)$ by performing controlled planar geometric transformations and constructing an auxiliary graph whose planarity yields the upper bound; (2) when $s$ is large, $F_r(d,s,\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by $O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\log r\cdot s^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the geometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a variant of the Erd\H{o}s box problem.</description>

      <title>Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars for Web, Mobile and VR Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars, a real-time and cross-platform 3D avatar system. Many approaches have been proposed to animate Gaussian Splatting, but they often require camera arrays, long preprocessing times, or high-end GPUs. Some methods attempt to convert Gaussian Splatting into mesh-based representations, achieving lightweight performance but sacrificing visual fidelity. In contrast, our system efficiently animates Gaussian Splatting by leveraging parallel splat-wise processing to dynamically follow the underlying skinned mesh in real time while preserving high visual fidelity. From smartphone-based 3D scanning to on-device preprocessing, the entire process takes just around five minutes, with the avatar generation step itself completed in only about 30 seconds. Our system enables users to instantly transform their real-world appearance into a 3D avatar, making it ideal for seamless integration with social media and metaverse applications.
