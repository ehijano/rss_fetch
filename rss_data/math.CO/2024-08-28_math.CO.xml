      <title>A Determinantal Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an interesting identity for the sum of determinants, which is a generalization of the sum of a geometric progression. The proof is quite long and a number of other identities are proved along the way. Some of the more elementary ones are deferred to another section at the end.</description>

      <title>On vertex-girth-regular graphs: (Non-)existence, bounds and enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex-girth-regular $vgr(v,k,g,\lambda)$-graph is a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ and order $v$ in which every vertex belongs to exactly $\lambda$ cycles of length $g$. While all vertex-transitive graphs are necessarily vertex-girth-regular, the majority of vertex-girth-regular graphs are not vertex-transitive. Similarly, while many of the smallest $k$-regular graphs of girth $g$, the so-called $(k,g)$-cages, are vertex-girth-regular, infinitely many vertex-girth-regular graphs of degree $k$ and girth $g$ exist for many pairs $k,g$. Due to these connections, the study of vertex-girth-regular graphs promises insights into the relations between the classes of extremal, highly symmetric, and locally regular graphs of given degree and girth. This paper lays the foundation to such study by investigating the fundamental properties of $vgr(v,k,g,\lambda)$-graphs, specifically the relations necessarily satisfied by the parameters $v,k,g$ and $\lambda$ to admit the existence of a corresponding vertex-girth-regular graph, by presenting constructions of infinite families of $vgr(v,k,g,\lambda)$-graphs, and by establishing lower bounds on the number $v$ of vertices in a $vgr(v,k,g,\lambda)$-graph. It also includes computational results determining the orders of smallest cubic and quartic graphs of small girths.</description>

      <title>Induced Saturation of the Poset 2C_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $X$, the power set $\mathbb{P}(X)$, and a finite poset $P$, a family $F\subset \mathbb{P}(X)$ is said to be induced-$P$-free if there is no injection $\phi: P\rightarrow \mathbb{P}(X)$ such that $\phi(p)\subseteq\phi(q)$ if and only if $p\leq_{P} q$. The family $F$ is induced-$P$-saturated if it is maximal with respect to being induced-$P$-free. If $n=|X|$, then the size of the smallest induced-$P$-saturated family in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ is denoted $sat(n,P)$.
  The poset $2C_2$ is two disjoint 2-chains (the Hasse diagram is two vertex-disjoint edges) and Keszegh, Lemons, Martin, P\'alv\"olgyi, and Patk\'os proved that $n+2\leq sat(n,2C_2)\leq 2n$ and gave one isomorphism class of an induced-$2C_2$-saturated family that achieves the upper bound.
  We show that the lower bound can be improved to $3n/2 + 1/2$ by examining the necessary structure of a saturated family. In addition, we provide many examples of induced-$2C_2$-saturated families of size $2n$ in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ where $|X|=n$.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on isolation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of graphs. A set $D$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{F}$-isolating if the graph obtained by removing from $G$ all the vertices in $D$ and their neighbors does not have a copy of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G, \mathcal{F})$, is the size of a smallest $\mathcal{F}$-isolating set of $G$. We establish sharp upper bounds on the $\mathcal{F}$-isolation number of a tree in terms of the order and the number of leaves for the case where $\mathcal{F}$ consists of the star $K_{1,k}$ for some $k\geq 1$. Moreover, we characterize all trees attaining the bounds.</description>

      <title>On $r$-Equichromatic Lines with few points in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ green and $n - k$ red points in $\mathbb{C}^2$. A line determined by $i$ green and $j$ red points such that $i + j \ge 2$ and $|i - j| \le r$ is called \emph{r-equichromatic}. We establish lower bounds for $1$-equichromatic and $2$-equichromatic lines. In particular, we show that if at most $2n-k-2$ points of $P$ are collinear, then the number of $1$-equichromatic lines passing through at most six points is at least $\frac{1}{4}(6n-k(k+3))$, and if at most $\frac{2}{3}(2n - k)$ points of $P$ are collinear, then the number of $2$-equichromatic lines passing through at most four points is at least $\frac{1}{6}(10n - k(k + 5))$.</description>

      <title>On $3$-designs from $PGL(2,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group $PGL(2,q)$ acts $3$-transitively on the projective line $GF(q) \cup \{\infty\}$. Thus, an orbit of its action on the $k$-subsets of the projective line is the block set of a $3$-$(q+1,k,\lambda)$ design. We find the parameters of the designs formed by the orbit of a block of the form $\langle \theta^r \rangle$ or $\langle \theta^r \rangle \cup \{ 0\}$, where $\theta$ is a primitive element of $GF(q)$.</description>

      <title>Pattern-restricted cyclic permutations with a pattern-restricted cycle form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider cyclic permutations that avoid the monotone decreasing permutation $k(k-1)\ldots 21$, whose cycle also demonstrates some pattern avoidance. If the cycle is written in standard form with 1 appearing at the beginning of the cycle and the standard form avoids a pattern of length 3, we find answers in terms of continued fraction generating functions. We also consider the case that every cyclic rotation of the cycle form of the permutation avoids a pattern of length 4 and enumerate two such cases.</description>

      <title>Strongly nice property and Schur positivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of nice graphs, we introduce the concept of strongly nice property, which can be used to study the Schur positivity of symmetric functions. We show that a graph and all its induced subgraphs are strongly nice if and only if it is claw-free, which strengthens a result of Stanley and provides further evidence for the well-known conjecture on the Schur positivity of claw-free graphs. As another application, we solve Wang and Wang's conjecture on the non-Schur positivity of squid graphs $Sq(2n-1;1^n)$ for $n \ge 3$ by proving that these graphs are not strongly nice.</description>

      <title>Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enumerate the numbers $Av_n^k(1324)$ of 1324-avoiding $n$-permutations with exactly $k$ inversions for all $k$ and $n \geq (k+7)/2$. The result depends on a structural characterization of such permutations in terms of a new notion of almost-decomposability. In particular, our enumeration verifies half of a conjecture of Claesson, Jel\'inek and Steingr\'imsson, according to which $Av_n^k(1324) \leq Av_{n+1}^k(1324)$ for all $n$ and $k$. Proving also the other half would improve the best known upper bound for the exponential growth rate of the number of $1324$-avoiders from $13.5$ to approximately $13.002$.</description>

      <title>Colorful fractional Helly theorem via weak saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two celebrated extensions of the classical Helly's theorem are the fractional Helly theorem and the colorful Helly theorem. Bulavka, Goodarzi, and Tancer recently established the optimal bound for the unified generalization of the fractional and the colorful Helly theorems using a colored extension of the exterior algebra. In this paper, we combinatorially reduce both the fractional Helly theorem and its colorful version to a classical problem in extremal combinatorics known as {weak saturation}. No such results connecting the fractional Helly theorem and weak saturation are known in the long history of literature. These reductions, along with basic linear algebraic arguments for the reduced weak saturation problems, let us give new short proofs of the optimal bounds for both the fractional Helly theorem and its colorful version without using exterior algebra.</description>

      <title>Counting pattern-avoiding permutations by big descents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A descent $k$ of a permutation $\pi=\pi_{1}\pi_{2}\dots\pi_{n}$ is called a \textit{big descent} if $\pi_{k}&gt;\pi_{k+1}+1$; denote the number of big descents of $\pi$ by $\operatorname{bdes}(\pi)$. We study the distribution of the $\operatorname{bdes}$ statistic over permutations avoiding prescribed sets of length-three patterns. Specifically, we classify all pattern sets $\Pi\subseteq\mathfrak{S}_{3}$ of size 1 and 2 into $\operatorname{bdes}$-Wilf equivalence classes, and we derive a formula for the distribution of big descents for each of these classes. Our methods include generating function techniques along with various bijections involving objects such as Dyck paths and binary words. Several future directions of research are proposed, including conjectures concerning real-rootedness, log-concavity, and Schur positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple non-complete connected graph on $[n] = \{1, \ldots, n\}$ and $\kappa(G) \geq 1$ its vertex connectivity. Let $f(G)$ denote the number of free vertices of $G$ and $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ the diameter of $G$. The final goal of this paper is to determine all sequences of integers $(n,f,d,k)$ with $n\geq 8$, $f\geq 0$, $d\geq 2$ and $k\geq 1$ for which there exists a finite simple non-complete connected graph on $[n]$ with $f=f(G)$, $d=\mathrm{diam}(G)$ and $k=\kappa(G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $d \ge 2$ there exists a dense collection of subsets of $[n]^d$ such that no two of them have a symmetric difference that may be written as the $d$th power of a union of at most $\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$ intervals. This provides a limitation on reasonable tightenings of a question of Alon from 2023 and of a conjecture of Gowers from 2009, and investigates a direction analogous to that of recent works of Conlon, Kam\v{c}ev, Leader, R\"aty and Spiegel on intervals in the Hales-Jewett theorem.</description>

Abstract: We classify the sum-free subsets of ${\mathbb F}_3^n$ whose density exceeds $\frac16$. This yields a resolution of Vsevolod Lev's periodicity conjecture, which asserts that if a sum-free subset ${A\subseteq {\mathbb F}_3^n}$ is maximal with respect to inclusion and aperiodic (in the sense that there is no non-zero vector $v$ satisfying $A+v=A$), then $|A|\le \frac12(3^{n-1}+1)$ -- a bound known to be optimal if $n\ne 2$, while for $n=2$ there are no such sets.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>

      <title>Maximum induced trees and forests of bounded degree in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic behaviour of maximum sizes of induced trees and forests has been studied extensively in last decades, though the overall picture is far from being complete. In this paper, we close several significant gaps: 1) We prove $2$-point concentration of the maximum sizes of an induced forest and an induced tree with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ in dense binomial random graphs $G(n,p)$ with constant probability $p$. 2) We show concentration in an explicit interval of size $o(1/p)$ for the maximum size of an induced forest with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ for $1/n\ll p=o(1)$. Our proofs rely on both the second moment approach, with the probabilistic part involving Talagrand's concentration inequality and the analytical part involving saddle-point analysis, and new results on enumeration of labelled trees and forests that might be of their own interest.</description>

      <title>Period patterns, entry points, and orders in the Lucas sequences: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) extend theory on certain statistics in the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences modulo $m$ to the Lucas sequences $U := \left(U_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$ and $V := \left(V_n(p,q)\right)_{n \geq 0}$, and (2) apply some of this theory to a novel graphical approach of $U$ and $V$ modulo $m$. Upon placing the cycle of repeating sequence terms in a circle, several fascinating patterns which would otherwise be overlooked emerge. We generalize a wealth of known Fibonacci and Lucas statistical identities to the $U$ and $V$ settings using primary sources such as Lucas in 1878, Carmichael in 1913, Wall in 1960, and Vinson in 1963, amongst others. We use many of these generalized identities to form the theoretical basis for our graphical results. Based on the order of $m$, defined as $\omega(m) := \frac{\pi(m)}{e(m)}$, where $\pi(m)$ is the period of $m$ and $e(m)$ is the entry point of $m$, we describe behaviors shared by $U$ and $V$ with parameters $q = \pm 1$. In particular, we exhibit some tantalizing examples in the following three sequence pairs: Fibonacci and Lucas, Pell and associated Pell, and balancing and Lucas-balancing.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz functions on weak expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a connected finite graph $G$, an integer-valued function $f$ on $V(G)$ is called $M$-Lipschitz if the value of $f$ changes by at most $M$ along the edges of $G$. In 2013, Peled, Samotij, and Yehudayoff showed that random $M$-Lipschitz functions on graphs with sufficiently good expansion typically exhibit small fluctuations, giving sharp bounds on the typical range of such functions, assuming $M$ is not too large. We prove that the same conclusion holds under a relaxed expansion condition and for larger $M$, (partially) answering questions of Peled et al. Our techniques involve a combination of Sapozhenko's graph container methods and entropy methods from information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and specializing some cluster variables to one.</description>

      <title>Simple Models of Randomization and Preservation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present new and more uniform model-theoretic/combinatorial proofs of the theorems (in [5] and [4]): The randomization $T^{R}$ of a complete first-order theory $T$ with $NIP$/stability is a (complete) first-order continuous theory with $NIP$/stability. The proof method for both theorems is based on the significant use of a particular type of models of $T^{R}$, namely simple models, and certain indiscernible arrays. Using simple models of $T^R$ gives the advantage of re-proving these theorems in a simpler and quantitative manner. We finally turn our attention to $NSOP$ in randomization. We show that based on the definition of $NSOP$ given [11], $T^R$ is stable if and only if it is $NIP$ and $NSOP$.</description>

      <title>Efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme for the genus of dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main results of this paper provide an Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (EPTAS) for approximating the genus (and non-orientable genus) of dense graphs. By dense we mean that $|E(G)|\ge \alpha |V(G)|^2$ for some fixed $\alpha&gt;0$. While a constant factor approximation is trivial for this class of graphs, approximations with factor arbitrarily close to 1 need a sophisticated algorithm and complicated mathematical justification. More precisely, we provide an algorithm that for a given (dense) graph $G$ of order $n$ and given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, returns an integer $g$ such that $G$ has an embedding into a surface of genus $g$, and this is $\varepsilon$-close to a minimum genus embedding in the sense that the minimum genus $\mathsf{g}(G)$ of $G$ satisfies: $\mathsf{g}(G)\le g\le (1+\varepsilon)\mathsf{g}(G)$. The running time of the algorithm is $O(f(\varepsilon)\,n^2)$, where $f(\cdot)$ is an explicit function. Next, we extend this algorithm to also output an embedding (rotation system) whose genus is $g$. This second algorithm is an Efficient Polynomial-time Randomized Approximation Scheme (EPRAS) and runs in time $O(f_1(\varepsilon)\,n^2)$.</description>

      <title>A polynomial Time Algorithm to Solve The Max-atom Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider $m$ ($m \geq 1$)conjunctions of Max-atoms that is atoms of the form $\max(z,y) + r \geq x$, where the offset $r$ is a real constant and $x,y,z$ are variables. We show that the Max-atom problem (MAP) belongs to $\textsf{P}$. Indeed, we provide an algorithm which solves the MAP in $O(n^{6} m^{2} + n^{4} m^{3} + n^{2} m^{4})$ operations, where $n$ is the number of variables which compose the max-atoms. As a by-product other problems also known to be in $\textsf{NP} \cap \textsf{co-NP}$ are in $\textsf{P}$. P1: the problem to know if a tropical cone is trivial or not. P2: problem of tropical rank of a tropical matrix. P3: parity game problem. P4: scheduling problem with AND/OR precedence constraints. P5: problem on hypergraph (shortest path). P6: problem in model checking and $\mu$-calculus.</description>

Abstract: Based on the vertex operator realization of the Schur functions, a determinant-type plethystic Murnaghan--Nakayama rule is obtained and utilized to derive a general formula of the expansion coefficients of $s_{\nu}$ in the plethysm product $(p_{n}\circ h_{k})s_{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the equivalence between our algebraic rule and the combinatorial one is also established. As an application, we provide a simple way to compute the generalized Waring formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In structural rigidity, one studies frameworks of bars and joints in Euclidean space. Such a framework is an articulated structure consisting of rigid bars, joined together at joints around which the bars may rotate. In this paper, we will describe articulated motions of realisations of hypergraphs that uses the terminology of graph of groups, and describe the motions of such a framework using group theory. Our approach allows to model a variety of situations, such as parallel redrawings, scenes, polytopes, realisations of graphs on surfaces, and even unique colourability of graphs. This approach allows a concise description of various dualities in rigidity theory. We also provide a lower bound on the dimension of the infinitesimal motions of such a framework in the special case when the underlying group is a Lie group.</description>

      <title>On boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study boundedness of zeros of the independence polynomial of tori for sequences of tori converging to the integer lattice. We prove that zeros are bounded for sequences of balanced tori, but unbounded for sequences of highly unbalanced tori. Here balanced means that the size of the torus is at most exponential in the shortest side length, while highly unbalanced means that the longest side length of the torus is super exponential in the product over the other side lengths cubed. We discuss implications of our results to the existence of efficient algorithms for approximating the independence polynomial on tori.
  This project was partially inspired by the relationship between zeros of partition functions and holomorphic dynamics, a relationship that in the last two decades played a prominent role in the field. Besides presenting new results, we survey this relationship and its recent consequences.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion and Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion $\mathsf{OI}$, a concept analogous to M\"obius inversion on finite posets, which is applicable to order-preservings functions from a finite poset to the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(V)$ of an inner product space $V$. Orthogonal Inversion is a special case of the broader concept of Orthomodular Inversion, where the target space is any orthomodular lattice, which we also identify.
  We apply $\mathsf{OI}$ in order to construct a "non-negative" persistence diagram for multiparameter filtrations $\mathsf{F}$ of a finite simplicial complex $K$ indexed over an arbitrary finite poset $P$, by applying it to the birth-death spaces of $\mathsf{F}$. Analogously to $1$-parameter classical persistence diagrams, these multiparameter Grassmannian persistence diagrams offer straightforward interpretability. Specifically, to a segment $(b, d) \in \mathsf{Seg}(P)$, (1) the Grassmannian persistence diagram canonically assigns a vector subspace of $C_q^K$ consisting of cycles that are born at $b$ and become boundaries at $d$ and (2) this assignment is exhaustive at the homology level.
  In the case of 1-parameter filtrations, we also study a variant of $\mathsf{OI}$ that is applicable to persistent Laplacian kernels.</description>

      <title>Beyond chromatic threshold via the $(p,q)$-theorem, and a sharp blow-up phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a novel connection between the well-known chromatic threshold problem in extremal combinatorics and the celebrated $(p,q)$-theorem in discrete geometry. In particular, for a graph $G$ with bounded clique number and a natural density condition, we prove a $(p,q)$-theorem for an abstract convexity space associated with $G$. Our result strengthens those of Thomassen and Nikiforov on the chromatic threshold of cliques. Our $(p,q)$-theorem can also be viewed as a $\chi$-boundedness result for (what we call) ultra maximal $K_r$-free graphs.
  We further show that the graphs under study are blow-ups of constant size graphs, improving a result of Oberkampf and Schacht on homomorphism threshold of cliques. Our result unravels the cause underpinning such a blow-up phenomenon, differentiating the chromatic and homomorphism threshold problems for cliques. It implies that for the homomorphism threshold problem, rather than the minimum degree condition usually considered in the literature, the decisive factor is a clique density condition on co-neighborhoods of vertices. More precisely, we show that if an $n$-vertex $K_{r}$-free graph $G$ satisfies that the common neighborhood of every pair of non-adjacent vertices induces a subgraph with $K_{r-2}$-density at least $\varepsilon&gt;0$, then $G$ must be a blow-up of some $K_r$-free graph $F$ on at most $2^{O(\frac{r}{\varepsilon}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ vertices. Furthermore, this single exponential bound is optimal. We construct examples with no $K_r$-free homomorphic image of size smaller than $2^{\Omega_r(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impossibility of certain $({n^2+n+k}_{n+1})$ configurations. Firstly, for $k=2$, the result of \cite{gropp1992non} that $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$ is even and $n+1$ is a perfect square or $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$ is odd and $n-1$ is a perfect square is reproved using the incidence matrix $N$ and analysing the form of $N^TN$. Then, for all $k$, configurations where paralellism is a transitive property are considered. It is then analogously established that if $n\equiv0$ or $n\equiv k-1$ mod $k$ for $k$ even, then $\frac{n^2+n}{k}$ is even and $n+1$ is a perfect square or $\frac{n^2+n}{k}$ is odd and $n-(k-1)$ is a perfect square. Finally, the case $k=3$ is investigated in full generality.</description>

      <title>Partition subcubic planar graphs into independent sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A packing $(1^{\ell}, 2^k)$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $\ell$ independent sets and $k$ $2$-independent sets (whose pairwise vertex distance is at least $3$). The famous Four Color Theorem, proved by Appel and Haken as well as Robertson et al., shows that every planar graph is $4$-colorable, i.e., every planar graph is packing $(1^4)$-colorable. The square coloring of planar graphs was first studied by Wegner in 1977. Thomassen, and independently Hartke et al. proved one can always square color a cubic planar graph with $7$ colors, i.e., every subcubic planar graph is packing $(2^7)$-colorable. We focus on packing $(1^{\ell}, 2^k)$-colorings, which lie between proper coloring and square coloring. Gastineau and Togni proved every subcubic graph is packing $(1,2^6)$-colorable. Furthermore, they asked whether every subcubic graph except the Petersen graph is packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable.
  In this paper, we prove that every subcubic planar graph is packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable, extending the result of Thomassen and Hartke et al.. This also answers the question of Gastineau and Togni affirmatively for subcubic planar graphs. Moreover, we prove that there exists an infinite family of subcubic planar graphs that are not packing $(1,2^4)$-colorable, which shows that our result is the best possible. Besides, our result is also sharp in the sense that the disjoint union of Petersen graphs is subcubic and non-planar, but not packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable.</description>

      <title>$s$-Modular, $s$-congruent and $s$-duplicate partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial properties of three classes of integer partitions: (1) $s$-modular partitions, a class consisting of partitions into parts with a number of occurrences (i.e., multiplicity) congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $s$, (2) $s$-congruent partitions, which generalize Sellers' partitions into parts not congruent to $2$ modulo $4$, and (3) $s$-duplicate partitions, of which the partitions having distinct odd parts and enumerated by the function $\mypod(n)$ are a special case. In this vein, we generalize Alladi's series expansion for the product generating function of $\mypod(n)$ and show that Andrews' generalization of G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities coincides with the number of partitions into parts simultaneously $s$-congruent and $t$-distinct (parts appearing fewer than $t$ times).</description>

Abstract: We determine the maximum index and the signed graphs with the maximum index among all $\mathcal{K}_{2,t}^-$-free unbalanced signed graphs with fixed order for $t\geq 3$, as well as the second maximum index and the signed graphs with the second maximum index among all $\mathcal{K}_{2,t}^-$-free unbalanced signed graphs with fixed order for $t\geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Graphical regular representations of $(2,p)$-generated groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For groups $G$ that can be generated by an involution and an element of odd prime order, this paper gives a sufficient condition for a certain Cayley graph of $G$ to be a graphical regular representation (GRR), that is, for the Cayley graph to have full automorphism group isomorphic to $G$. This condition enables one to show the existence of GRRs of prescribed valency for a large class of groups, and in this paper, $k$-valent GRRs of finite nonabelian simple groups with $k\geq5$ are considered.</description>

      <title>From Combinatorics to Geometry: The Dynamics of Graph Gradient Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a link between graph theory and geometry that arises when considering graph dynamical systems with odd interactions. The equilibrium set in such systems is not a collection of isolated points, but rather a union of manifolds, which may intersect creating singularities and may vary in dimension. We prove that geometry and stability of such manifolds are governed by combinatorial properties of the underlying graph. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the equilibrium set using graph homology and a lower bound using graph coverings. Moreover, we show how graph automorphisms relate to geometric singularities and prove that the decomposition of a graph into $2$-vertex-connected components induces a decomposition of the equilibrium set that preserves three notions of stability.</description>

      <title>Weighted Borel Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly stable ideals are a class of monomial ideals which correspond to generic initial ideals in characteristic zero and can be described completely by their Borel generators, a subset of the minimal monomial generators of the ideal. Francisco, Mermin, and Schweig developed formulas for the Hilbert series and Betti numbers of strongly stable ideals in terms of their Borel generators. In this work, a specialization of strongly stable ideals is presented which further restricts the subset of relevant generators. A choice of weight vector $w\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt; 0}^n$ restricts the set of strongly stable ideals to a subset designated as $w$-stable ideals. This restriction further compresses the Borel generators to a subset termed the weighted Borel generators of the ideal. A new Macaulay2 package wStableIdeals.m2 has been developed alongside this paper and segments of code support computations within.</description>

      <title>The Divisibility of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ Character Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power, and $d$ a positive integer. We study the proportion of irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n,q)$ whose values evaluated on a fixed matrix $g$ are divisible by $d$. As $n$ approaches infinity, this proportion tends to $1$ when $q$ is coprime to $d$. When $q$ and $d$ are not coprime, and $g=1$, this proportion is bounded above by $\frac{1}{q}$.</description>
