      <title>Estimation of the pseudoscalar glueball mass based on a modified Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modified Transformer model is introduced for estimating the mass of pseudoscalar glueball in lattice QCD. The model takes as input a sequence of floating-point numbers with lengths ranging from 30 to 35 and produces a two-dimensional vector output. It integrates floating-point embeddings and positional encoding, and is trained using binary cross-entropy loss. The paper provides a detailed description of the model's components and training methods, and compares the performance of the traditional least squares method, the previously used deep neural network, and the modified Transformer in mass estimation. The results show that the modified Transformer model achieves greater accuracy in mass estimation than the traditional least squares method. Additionally, compared to the deep neural network, this model utilizes positional encoding and can handle input sequences of varying lengths, offering enhanced adaptability.</description>

      <title>Neutral pion polarizabilities from four-point functions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a proof-of-principle lattice QCD simulation of the electric and magnetic polarizabilities for a neutral pion in the four-point function method. The results are based on the same quenched Wilson ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at $\beta=6.0$ with pion mass from 1100 to 370 MeV previously used for a charged pion. For electric polarizability, the results are largely consistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast, there are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the four-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The situation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for a neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the four-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Transversity from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of recent progress in lattice QCD simulations that is enabling precision studies of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon. We present results on nucleon charges and second Mellin moments of parton distribution functions and generalized parton distributions, highlighting results obtained at the continuum limit using only gauge ensembles simulated with physical quark masses. The tensor charge and transversity moments are determined with controlled systematics and used to extract nucleon transverse density distributions. We also discuss progress towards the direct evaluation of generalized parton distributions in lattice QCD and the impact they are having on phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Structure Factors in Two Dimensional $Z_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the dynamic structure factor of the simplest two dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. This provides an important benchmark for future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would be expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be understood in terms of the elementary excitations.</description>

      <title>$X(3872)$ Relevant $D\bar{D}^*$ Scattering in $N_f=2$ Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $S$-wave $D\bar{D}^*(I=0)$ scattering at four different pion masses $m_\pi$ ranging from 250 MeV to 417 MeV from $N_f=2$ lattice QCD. Three energy levels $E_{2,3,4}$ are extracted at each $m_\pi$. The analysis of $E_{2,3}$ using the effective range expansion (ERE) comes out with a shallow bound state below the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold, and the phase shifts at $E_{3,4}$ indicate the possible existence of a resonance near 4.0 GeV. We also perform a joint analysis to $E_{2,3,4}$ through the $K$-matrix parameterization of the scattering amplitude. In this way, we observe a $D\bar{D}^*$ bound state whose properties are almost the same as that from the ERE analysis. At each $m_\pi$, this joint analysis also results in a resonance pole with a mass slightly above 4.0 GeV and a width around 40-60 MeV, which are compatible with the properties of the newly observed $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ by LHCb. More scrutinized lattice QCD calculations are desired to check the existence of this resonance.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the U(1) lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative phase boundaries in the Gross-Neveu model from a stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two out of three phase boundaries of the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the chiral limit can be obtained from a standard, perturbative stability analysis of the homogeneous phases. The third one separating the massive homogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far only be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase boundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the thermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for the massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu model could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the full crystal solution.</description>
