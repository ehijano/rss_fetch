      <title>Consistent inclusion of triple substitutions within a coupled cluster based static quantum embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate a solver for the fragment problem with accuracy beyond coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) into the previously proposed static embedding framework, MPCC. To this end, we employ a CCSDT solver for the fragment subsystem. For the environment subsystem, we construct a perturbative estimate of the triples amplitudes, explicitly accounting for feedback from all fragment amplitudes. The resulting approach is denoted MPCCSDT(pt). We further introduce a more complete formulation in which feedback from the environment amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes is also included. This scheme involves an iterative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes and is denoted MPCCSDT(it). In addition, we assess the accuracy of the previously proposed low-level method by introducing a modified low-level approach that incorporates a lowest-order treatment of selected long-range effects, including spin fluctuations and charge polarization. All resulting approaches may be viewed as post-CCSD(T) methods. We therefore consider test cases for which CCSD(T) exhibits substantial deviations from CCSDT. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of triples amplitudes at the fragment level alone is insufficient; a perturbative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes is required. For many energy-difference applications, feedback from the environment triples amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes, is not essential, but it does play a role in the very challenging molecules. A very interesting finding from our study is that in some challenging cases, we need an improved (second-order) perturbative method for the SD amplitudes, going beyond the first-order one used in our earlier work.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Pipek-Mezey Wannier Functions via the Co-Iterative Augmented Hessian Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a $k$-point extension of the second-order co-iterative augmented Hessian (CIAH) algorithm, termed $k$-CIAH, for Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization of Wannier functions (WFs). By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $\Gamma$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $\Gamma$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.</description>

      <title>Exploitation of complex Abelian point groups in quantum-chemical calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-chemical calculations often make use of point-group theory to exploit molecular symmetry, resulting in a reduction of the computational cost and in insights into the electronic structure. This exploitation is often limited to subgroups of $D_{2h}$ which are Abelian with real characters. Here, we extend the symmetry exploitation to Abelian point groups with complex characters. Such point groups are often encountered in calculations that involve finite magnetic fields, though their occurrence is not limited to these cases alone. We present the evaluation of integrals over symmetry-adapted orbitals using the double-coset decomposition, as well as the use of these symmetries in the contractions needed within post Hartree Fock calculations in the context of block tensors. Efficiency gains are discussed for four simple hydrocarbons that exhibit a complex Abelian point group in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States Based on Selected Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.</description>

      <title>Early-warning the compact-to-dendritic transition via spatiotemporal learning of two-dimensional growth images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitions between distinct dynamical regimes are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium systems. As a prototypical example, deposition growth is often accompanied by irreversible morphological instabilities. Forecasting such transitions from pre-transition configurations remains fundamentally challenging, as early precursors are weak, spatially heterogeneous, and masked by inherent fluctuations. Here, we investigate compact-to-dendritic transitions (CDTs) in a two-dimensional particle-based electrodeposition model and formulate a horizon-based early-warning task using trajectory-resolved transition points. We demonstrate that anticipating the CDT is intrinsically a spatiotemporal problem: neither static morphological descriptors nor temporal learning applied to predefined features alone yields reliable predictive signals. In contrast, end-to-end learning of jointly optimized spatial and temporal representations from growth images enables robust anticipation across a wide range of prediction horizons. Analysis of the learned latent dynamics reveals the emergence of a low-dimensional surrogate variable that tracks progressive morphological destabilization and undergoes reorganization near the transition. We further show that the learned spatiotemporal representation exhibits limited but systematic transferability across reaction-rate conditions, with predictive performance degrading as the inference condition departs from the training condition, consistent with changes in the latent-state dynamics. Overall, our results establish a general formulation for forecasting incipient instabilities in nonequilibrium interfacial growth, with implications for the predictive monitoring and control of pattern-forming driven systems.</description>

      <title>Nuclear gradients from auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo and their application in geometry optimization and transition state search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a method for computing accurate and scalable nuclear forces within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework. Our approach leverages automatic differentiation of the energy functional to obtain nuclear gradients at a computational cost comparable to that of energy evaluation. The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.</description>

      <title>Estimating Full Path Lengths and Kinetics from Partial Path Transition Interface Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths.</description>

      <title>Divergent Impact Charging of Polymer Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a particle contacts a surface of another material, it is commonly believed that the particle acquires an impact charge that scales inversely with its pre-impact charge and whose polarity is set by the materials. We show that this belief holds for conductive particles but fails for polymers. For polymers, the impact charge increases linearly with the particle's pre-impact charge. Its polarity is not determined by the materials but by the pre-impact particle charge relative to a divergence point at which the net charge transfer reverses. We attribute this divergence to the attraction of surrounding ions to the particle surface. These attracted ions carry polarity opposite to that of the particle, and their amount scales with the particle charge. They transfer to the opposing surface during contact, thereby defining the impact charge. We propose a phenomenological model for the divergent impact charge arising from this mechanism. Finally, we reexamine previous measurements and show that they support this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Effective classical potential for quantum statistical averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective potential that allows quantum thermal expectation values of a position-dependent observable to be estimated as a classical ensemble average of the corresponding function. We follow the approach of Feynman and Hibbs, but perform the mean-field treatment of quantum fluctuations about the path starting point rather than the path centroid. Furthermore, rather than performing a full variational optimization of the potential, we explore approximate functional forms that yield a numerical robustness. The resulting closed-form potential is exact in the classical and harmonic limits; benchmarks against exact position distributions for one-dimensional quartic, Morse, and double-well potentials, show good agreement for potentials with harmonic support.</description>

      <title>Negative thermal expansion in ice I polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental properties of ice have always attracted a lot of interest due to omnipresence of ice in many different natural contexts. Since cubic ice recently become experimentally accessible from a low-density gas hydrate precursor [1, 2], it has been possible to measure its density as a function of temperature in the whole thermodynamic range of metastability. We found strong analogies with respect to the other ice I polytype, i.e., hexagonal ice Ih [3], including the presence of a negative thermal expansion behavior at low temperature. Based on these results, a new enthalpy calculation quantifies the metastable nature of the cubic form and, consequently its inaccessibility from a "normal" ice Ih precursor.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Role of Higher-Lying Excited States in Organic Emitters via Multistate Ab Initio Kinetic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher lying excited states beyond S1 and T1 are widely recognized in many photophysical systems, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). However, their explicit and quantitative impact on photophysical observables such as photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and lifetimes is difficult to be attained experimentally and it has not been systematically assessed within a fully ab initio kinetic modeling framework. To address this gap, we developed KinLuv, a multistate excited state kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) and all possible monomolecular interconversion processes between all the electronic states, whose rate constants were computed using Fermi golden rule explicitly including the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling effect. We applied KinLuv to prototypical multi resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitters and their derivatives, as well as other representative organic chromophores, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse photophysical playgrounds beyond TADF. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce key experimental observables, including PLQY and prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes. Beyond its predictive power, the present results establish clear criteria for identifying when higher lying excited states influence the excited state decay and when simplified models remain adequate. This framework enables rational selection of minimal kinetic models that balance physical insight with numerical robustness, with direct implications for the in silico design of high performance organic emitters.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). For chalcogen substitution processing, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization widen the processing window by significantly lowering the sulfur sputtering energy threshold ($E_{\text{sputt,S}}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 30$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV via formation of sputtering products such as SO${}_2$ and SF${}_n$. Additionally, we show that experimentally relevant cryogenic temperatures strongly affect $E_{\text{sputt,S}}$. The dependence is confirmed via AIMD and also predicted by a mechanistic parameter-free theory, suggesting that $E_{\text{sputt}}(T)$ generalizes to other TMDs, functionalization, and surface impacts in general. Our results highlight oxygen/fluorine functionalization, ionic impact angle, and material temperature to be key control parameters for selective, damage-controlled chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>
