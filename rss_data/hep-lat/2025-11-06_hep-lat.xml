      <title>Approaches to the Inverse Fourier Transformation with Limited and Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate several approaches to address the inverse problem that arises in the limited inverse Fourier transform (L-IDFT) of quasi-distributions. The methods explored include Tikhonov regularization, the Backus-Gilbert method, the Bayesian approach with Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) prior, and the feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). We evaluate the performance of these methods using both mock data generated from toy models and real lattice data from quasi distribution, and further compare them with the physics-driven $\lambda$-extrapolation approach. Our results demonstrate that the L-IDFT constitutes a moderately tractable inverse problem Except for the Backus-Gilbert method, all the other approaches are capable of correctly reconstructing the quasi-distributions in momentum space. In particular, the Bayesian approach with GRW and the feedforward ANNs yield more stable and accurate reconstructions. Based on these investigations, we conclude that, for a given L-IDFT problem, selecting an appropriate reconstruction method according to the input data and carefully assessing the potential systematic uncertainties are essential for obtaining reliable results.</description>

      <title>A Precise $\alpha_s$ Determination from the R-improved QCD Static Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong coupling $\alpha_s$ is determined with high precision from fits to lattice QCD simulations on the static energy. Our theoretical setup relies on R-improving the three-loop fixed-order prediction for the static energy by removing its $u=1/2$ renormalon and summing up the associated large (infrared) logarithms which, in combination with radius-dependent renormalization scales (called profile functions) extends the validity of perturbation theory to distances up to $\sim 0.5\,$fm. Furthermore, we resum large ultrasoft logarithms to N$^3$LL accuracy using renormalization group evolution. We have checked that the standard four-loop R-evolution treats N$^4$LL and higher remnants in a non-symmetric way, hence we also account for this potential bias. Our estimate of the perturbative uncertainty is based on a random scan over the parameters specifying the profile functions and the treatment of R-evolution. We also devise a method to statistically combine into a single dataset results from independent simulations which use different lattice spacing and cover various ranges, which can be used to carry out fits in a much faster way. We explore the dependence of the extracted $\alpha_s$ value on the smallest and largest distances included in the dataset, on how R-evolution is treated, on how the fit is performed, and on the accuracy of ultrasoft resummation. From our final analysis, after evolving to the $Z$-pole we obtain $\alpha^{(n_f=5)}_s(m_Z)=0.1166\pm 0.0009$, compatible with the world average with similar incertitude.</description>

      <title>Classical shadows for sample-efficient measurements of gauge-invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods, albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including both circuit depth and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Scalar molecules $\eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$ and $\eta _{c}B_{c}^{+} $ with asymmetric quark contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic scalar molecules $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ with asymmetric quark contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c} \overline{b}$ are explored by means of the QCD sum rule method. Their masses and current couplings are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The obtained results show that they are strong-interaction unstable particles and transform to ordinary mesons' pairs. The molecule $\mathcal{M} _{b}$ dissociates through the process $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The decays $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are dominant modes for the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{c}$. The full decay widths of the molecules $\mathcal{ M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$ are estimated using these decay channels, as well as ones generated by the annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ and $c \overline{c}$ quarks in $\mathcal{M}_{b}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{c}$, respectively. The QCD three-point sum rule method is employed to find partial widths all of these channels. This approach is required to evaluate the strong couplings at the molecule-meson-meson vertices under consideration. The mass $m=(15728 \pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_b] =(93 \pm 17)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{b}$, and $ \widetilde{m}=(9712 \pm 72)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_c]=(70 \pm 10)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{c} $ offer valuable guidance for experimental searches at existing facilities.</description>

      <title>An exploratory calculation of $K_{\rm L}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from Lattice QCD at physical pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complex, long-distance two-photon-exchange amplitude which contributes to the rare $K_{\rm L}\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ decay from lattice QCD. We use a $24^3\times 64$ physical-pion-mass gauge field ensemble at an inverse lattice spacing of $1.023$ GeV and a QED${}_\infty$-based formalism. Our implementation strategies for all five non-SU$(3)$-flavor-suppressed diagram topologies are given in detail. We achieve a 25% statistical precision on the dispersive part of this long-distance amplitude. This calculation is carried out with 2+1 quark flavors and therefore requires the addition of counter terms to compensate for the absence of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. These counter terms are not included in the current calculation and will be the subject of a second paper. The precision of our results is limited by the reconstruction of the physical contribution of the $\eta$ intermediate state, for which various strategies are tested and compared.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram, which reveals the state of strongly interacting matter at different temperatures and densities, is key to answering open questions in physics, ranging from the behavior of particles in neutron stars to the conditions of the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce charge-singlet measurements to enforce color-neutrality constraints. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>
