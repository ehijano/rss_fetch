      <title>IoT-based Noise Monitoring using Mobile Nodes for Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Self-Organising Memristive Networks as Physical Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.</description>

      <title>Agentic Workflow for Education: Concepts and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture. Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic, nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.</description>

      <title>Embodying computation in nonlinear perturbative metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Racetrack computing with a topological boundary ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to move information around the device for processing and readout. While in magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields, mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories in neutral systems.</description>

      <title>FCT O-RAN: Design and Deployment of a Multi-Vendor End-to-End Private 5G Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of 5G networks into software-defined, agile, intelligent and programmable architectures necessitates a paradigm shift in deployment strategies. To deliver superior performance and surpass traditional systems, public and private 5G networks must adopt software-centric cloud native frameworks that enable flexibility through tailored configurations and optimized deployment approaches. In Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF) launched the Future Communications Research and Development Programme (FCP) to advance the nation's communications and connectivity landscape. At the core of this initiative is the Future Communications Translation Lab (FCT) at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), which focuses on advancing 5G technologies to higher readiness levels, facilitating their adoption across various industries. A key component is the deployment of FCT O-RAN, a state-of-the-art multi-vendor private 5G platform. The setup includes a 5G core network powered by Microsoft Affirmed and ENEA, O-RAN Centralized and Distributed Units from Radisys. Indoor Remote Units are deployed with Foxconn, while outdoor RUs are deployed with Benetel. To optimize the deployment of remote units, a digital twin was created using Wireless InSite, and performance evaluations were conducted for both the digital twin and the private 5G deployment. Smartphones equipped with QualiPoc were used to measure network performance. The testbed demonstrated effective performance with optimized bandwidth allocations for both indoor and outdoor environments. In the indoor setup, utilizing 50 MHz of bandwidth, a downlink throughput of 713 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 66 Mbps were achieved. Meanwhile, the outdoor setup, utilizing 40 MHz of bandwidth, achieved a downlink throughput of 371 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 55 Mbps.</description>

      <title>Content and Engagement Trends in COVID-19 YouTube Videos: Evidence from the Late Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p &lt; 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p &lt; 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects.</description>

      <title>FlexNGIA 2.0: Redesigning the Internet with Agentic AI - Protocols, Services, and Traffic Engineering Designed, Deployed, and Managed by AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating demands of immersive communications, alongside advances in network softwarization and AI-driven cognition and generative reasoning, create a pivotal opportunity to rethink and reshape the future Internet. In this context, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven Internet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously orchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime, perceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement, deploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs), network functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and traffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and efficiency under evolving conditions.
  The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its constituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design, implementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools and other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the ability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the implementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport protocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control schemes, and resource allocation strategies.
  FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks, where fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design, implement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and behaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. To bring this vision to reality, we also identify key research challenges toward achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and agentic AI-driven networks.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Split Learning for Resource-Constrained Environments: A Smart Farming Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited resources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To address these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework that utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training without direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By distributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split reduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated learning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves classification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more modest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge deployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and maximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest datasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to baseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the energy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial savings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory overheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results highlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming environments.</description>

      <title>RSMA Assisted ISAC With Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The harsh environment and scarce resources post-disaster drive the equipment to be miniaturized and portable. Based on this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems play a significant role in providing emergency wireless networks. In order to reduce the hardware cost, a hybrid beamforming (HBF) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, which exploits the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, is considered in this paper. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom, thus leading to increased interference among communication users and radar sensing. To solve this problem, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is adopted to enhance the emergency mmWave-ISAC system. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization objective by jointly designing common rate allocation and HBF. Then, we propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>The Questionable Influence of Entanglement in Quantum Optimisation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \&amp; Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Particle-in-Cell Method for Plasma Simulations</title>

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Programmable k-local Ising Machines and all-optical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Photonic Platforms</title>

Abstract: Photonic computing promises energy-efficient acceleration for optimization and learning, yet discrete combinatorial search and continuous function approximation have largely required distinct devices and control stacks. Here we unify k-local Ising optimization and optical Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) learning on a single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical computing. We introduce an SLM-centric primitive that realizes, in one stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical KAN layers. The key idea is to convert the structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding a single relay pass through the same spatial light modulator: a folded 4f relay re-images the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each selected clique or channel occupies a disjoint window with its own second pass phase patch. Propagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude. This yields native, per clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN layers, all trainable with in-situ physical gradients using two frames (forward and adjoint). We outline implementations on spatial photonic Ising machines, injection-locked vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) arrays, and Microsoft analog optical computers; in all cases the hardware change is one extra lens and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively parallel route to high-order Ising optimization and trainable, all-optical KAN processing on one platform.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>
