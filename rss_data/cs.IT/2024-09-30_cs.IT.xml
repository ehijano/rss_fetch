      <title>Learning Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming design is critical for the efficient operation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) MIMO systems. ISAC beamforming design in cell-free massive MIMO systems, compared to colocated MIMO systems, is more challenging due to the additional complexity of the distributed large number of access points (APs). To address this problem, this paper first shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) are a suitable machine learning framework. Then, it develops a novel heterogeneous GNN model inspired by the specific characteristics of the cell-free ISAC MIMO systems. This model enables the low-complexity scaling of the cell-free ISAC system and does not require full retraining when additional APs are added or removed. Our results show that the proposed architecture can achieve near-optimal performance, and applies well to various network structures.</description>

      <title>On the Strong Converse Exponent of the Classical Soft Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a lower and an upper bound for the strong converse exponent of the soft covering problem in the classical setting. This exponent characterizes the slowest achievable convergence speed of the total variation to one when a code with a rate below mutual information is applied to a discrete memoryless channel for synthesizing a product output distribution. We employ a type-based approach and additionally propose an equivalent form of our upper bound using the R\'enyi mutual information. Future works include tightening these two bounds to determine the exact bound of the strong converse exponent.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Beamforming Training in Terahertz Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) enables promising Tbps-level wireless transmission thanks to its prospect of ultra-huge spectrum utilization and narrow beamforming in the next sixth-generation (6G) communication system. Compared to millimeter wave (mmWave), THz intrinsically possesses compellingly severer molecular absorption and high pathloss serving confined coverage area. These defects should be well conquered under the employment of ultra-thin 3D beamforming with enormous deployed antennas with high beam gains. However, pencil-beams require substantially high overhead of time and power to train its optimal THz beamforming direction. We propose an energy efficient (EE) oriented THz beamforming (EETBF) scheme by separating the original complex problem into beamforming training (EETBF-BT) acquirement and learning-enabled training power assignment (EETBF-PA). The historical beam data is employed to update next beam selection policy. The performance results have demonstrated that the proposed EETBF outperforms the existing benchmarks leveraging full beam search, iterative search, linear/binary search as well as non-power-control based mechanism in open literature. Our proposed EETBF scheme results in the lowest training latency and power consumption, achieving the highest effective rate and EE performance.</description>

      <title>Simpler Gradient Methods for Blind Super-Resolution with Lower Iteration Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of blind super-resolution, which can be formulated as a low-rank matrix recovery problem via vectorized Hankel lift (VHL). The previous gradient descent method based on VHL named PGD-VHL relies on additional regularization such as the projection and balancing penalty, exhibiting a suboptimal iteration complexity. In this paper, we propose a simpler unconstrained optimization problem without the above two types of regularization and develop two new and provable gradient methods named VGD-VHL and ScalGD-VHL. A novel and sharp analysis is provided for the theoretical guarantees of our algorithms, which demonstrates that our methods offer lower iteration complexity than PGD-VHL. In addition, ScalGD-VHL has the lowest iteration complexity while being independent of the condition number. Furthermore, our novel analysis reveals that the blind super-resolution problem is less incoherence-demanding, thereby eliminating the necessity for incoherent projections to achieve linear convergence. Empirical results illustrate that our methods exhibit superior computational efficiency while achieving comparable recovery performance to prior arts.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Data- and Model-Driven Probing Beams and Beam Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical search in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications incurs significant beam training overhead and delay, especially in a dynamic environment. Deep learning-enabled beam prediction is promising to significantly mitigate the overhead and delay, efficiently utilizing the site-specific channel prior. In this work, we propose to jointly optimize a data- and model-driven probe beam module and a cascaded data-driven beam predictor, with limitations in that the probe and communicate beams are restricted within the manifold space of uniform planer array and quantization of the phase modulator. First, The probe beam module senses the mmWave channel with a complex-valued neural network and outputs the counterpart RSRPs of probe beams. Second, the beam predictor estimates the RSRPs in the entire beamspace to minimize the prediction cross entropy and selects the optimal beam with the maximum RSRP value for data transmission. Additionally, we propose to add noise to the phase variables in the probe beam module, against quantization error. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled Cellular Systems Operated by Different Service Providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In realistic cellular communication systems, multiple service providers will operate within different frequency ranges. Each serving cell, which is managed by a distinct service provider, is designed individually due to the orthogonal frequencies. However, when a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed for a certain cell, the RIS still incurs reflective channels for the overall system since the RIS reflects signals across all frequency ranges. This may cause severe undesired performance degradation for the other cells unless the reflection coefficients are properly designed. To tackle this issue, by utilizing the Riemannian manifold optimization method, an RIS reflection coefficients design is proposed in this paper to maximize the performance improvements of the cell that deploys the RIS while minimizing the undesired performance degradation for the other cells simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design can effectively balance the two objectives for practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Error-Code Perspective on Metzner--Kapturowski-like Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a Metzner-Kapturowski-like decoding algorithm for high-order interleaved sum-rank-metric codes, offering a novel perspective on the decoding process through the concept of an error code. The error code, defined as the linear code spanned by the vectors forming the error matrix, provides a more intuitive understanding of the decoder's functionality and new insights.
  The proposed algorithm can correct errors of sum-rank weight up to $d-2$, where $d$ is the minimum distance of the constituent code, given a sufficiently large interleaving order. The decoder's versatility is highlighted by its applicability to any linear constituent code, including unstructured or random codes. The computational complexity is $O(\max\{n^3, n^2 s\})$ operations over $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$, where $n$ is the code length and $s$ is the interleaving order.
  We further explore the success probability of the decoder for random errors, providing an efficient algorithm to compute an upper bound on this probability. Additionally, we derive bounds and approximations for the success probability when the error weight exceeds the unique decoding radius, showing that the decoder maintains a high success probability in this regime.
  Our findings suggest that this decoder could be a valuable tool for the design and security analysis of code-based cryptosystems using interleaved sum-rank-metric codes. The new insights into the decoding process and the high success probability of the algorithm even beyond the unique decoding radius underscore its potential to contribute to various coding-related applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Based Mechanisms for Differentially Private Approximate CDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the $\varepsilon$-differentially private (DP) release of an approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the samples in a dataset. We assume that the true (approximate) CDF is obtained after lumping the data samples into a fixed number $K$ of bins. In this work, we extend the well-known binary tree mechanism to the class of \emph{level-uniform tree-based} mechanisms and identify $\varepsilon$-DP mechanisms that have a small $\ell_2$-error. We identify optimal or close-to-optimal tree structures when either of the parameters, which are the branching factors or the privacy budgets at each tree level, are given, and when the algorithm designer is free to choose both sets of parameters. Interestingly, when we allow the branching factors to take on real values, under certain mild restrictions, the optimal level-uniform tree-based mechanism is obtained by choosing equal branching factors \emph{independent} of $K$, and equal privacy budgets at all levels. Furthermore, for selected $K$ values, we explicitly identify the optimal \emph{integer} branching factors and tree height, assuming equal privacy budgets at all levels. Finally, we describe strategies for improving the private CDF estimates further, by combining multiple noisy estimates and by post-processing the estimates for consistency.</description>

      <title>Explainable Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR) for Large Knowledge Graphs with Applications in Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent connections and relationships between real-world entities. We propose a link prediction framework for KGs named Enrichment-Driven GrAph Reasoner (EDGAR), which infers new edges by mining entity-local rules. This approach leverages enrichment analysis, a well-established statistical method used to identify mechanisms common to sets of differentially expressed genes. EDGAR's inference results are inherently explainable and rankable, with p-values indicating the statistical significance of each enrichment-based rule.
  We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on a large-scale biomedical KG, ROBOKOP, focusing on drug repurposing for Alzheimer disease (AD) as a case study. Initially, we extracted 14 known drugs from the KG and identified 20 contextual biomarkers through enrichment analysis, revealing functional pathways relevant to shared drug efficacy for AD. Subsequently, using the top 1000 enrichment results, our system identified 1246 additional drug candidates for AD treatment. The top 10 candidates were validated using evidence from medical literature.
  EDGAR is deployed within ROBOKOP, complete with a web user interface. This is the first study to apply enrichment analysis to large graph completion and drug repurposing.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent RIS: From Reradiation Mode Optimization to Practical Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical framework for designing a physically consistent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the inefficiency of the conventional phase gradient approach. For a section of Cape Town and across three different coverage enhancement scenarios, we optimize the amplitude of the RIS reradiation modes using Sionna ray tracing and a gradient-based learning technique. We then determine the required RIS surface/sheet impedance given the desired amplitudes for the reradiation modes, design the corresponding unitcells, and validate the performance through full-wave numerical simulations using CST Microwave Studio. We further validate our approach by fabricating a RIS using the parallel plate waveguide technique and conducting experimental measurements that align with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A New Bound on the Cumulant Generating Function of Dirichlet Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for bounding the cumulant generating function (CGF) of a Dirichlet process (DP) $X \sim \text{DP}(\alpha \nu_0)$, using superadditivity. In particular, our key technical contribution is the demonstration of the superadditivity of $\alpha \mapsto \log \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \text{DP}(\alpha \nu_0)}[\exp( \mathbb{E}_X[\alpha f])]$, where $\mathbb{E}_X[f] = \int f dX$. This result, combined with Fekete's lemma and Varadhan's integral lemma, converts the known asymptotic large deviation principle into a practical upper bound on the CGF $ \log\mathbb{E}_{X\sim \text{DP}(\alpha\nu_0)}{\exp(\mathbb{E}_{X}{[f]})} $ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. The bound is given by the convex conjugate of the scaled reversed Kullback-Leibler divergence $\alpha\mathrm{KL}(\nu_0\Vert \cdot)$. This new bound provides particularly effective confidence regions for sums of independent DPs, making it applicable across various fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we depart from the widely-used gradient descent-based hierarchical federated learning (FL) algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical FL framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Within this framework, we propose two novel FL algorithms, which both use ADMM in the top layer: one that employs ADMM in the lower layer and another that uses the conventional gradient descent-based approach. The proposed framework enhances privacy, and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to the conventional algorithms in terms of learning convergence and accuracy. Additionally, gradient descent on the lower layer performs well even if the number of local steps is very limited, while ADMM on both layers lead to better performance otherwise.</description>

      <title>Best Arm Identification with Minimal Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by real-world applications that necessitate responsible experimentation, we introduce the problem of best arm identification (BAI) with minimal regret. This innovative variant of the multi-armed bandit problem elegantly amalgamates two of its most ubiquitous objectives: regret minimization and BAI. More precisely, the agent's goal is to identify the best arm with a prescribed confidence level $\delta$, while minimizing the cumulative regret up to the stopping time. Focusing on single-parameter exponential families of distributions, we leverage information-theoretic techniques to establish an instance-dependent lower bound on the expected cumulative regret. Moreover, we present an intriguing impossibility result that underscores the tension between cumulative regret and sample complexity in fixed-confidence BAI. Complementarily, we design and analyze the Double KL-UCB algorithm, which achieves asymptotic optimality as the confidence level tends to zero. Notably, this algorithm employs two distinct confidence bounds to guide arm selection in a randomized manner. Our findings elucidate a fresh perspective on the inherent connections between regret minimization and BAI.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Activity Detection in Cooperative Multi-Cell Massive MIMO: Scaling Law and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the path-loss exponent of the fading channel $\gamma &gt; 2.$ This finding shows that, in the multi-cell massive MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be correctly detected in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences based on a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Finally, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability.</description>

      <title>New non-GRS type MDS codes and NMDS codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of special linear codes involving their parameters, weight distributions, self-orthogonal properties, deep holes, and the existence of error-correcting pairs. We prove that such codes must be maximum distance separable (MDS) codes or near MDS codes and completely determine their weight distributions with the help of the solutions to some subset sum problems. Based on the Schur method, we show that such codes are not equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. A sufficient and necessary condition for such codes to be self-orthogonal is also characterized. Based on this condition, we further deduce that there are no self-dual codes in this class of linear codes and explicitly construct two classes of almost self-dual codes. Additionally, we find a class of deep holes of such codes and determine the existence of their error-correcting pairs in most cases, which also reveal more connections between such codes and GRS codes.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Group Testing</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variation of the group testing problem where each test is specified by an ordered subset of items and returns the first defective item in the specified order or returns null if there are no defectives. We refer to this as cascaded group testing and the goal is to identify a small set of $K$ defective items amongst a collection of size $N$, using as few tests as possible for perfect recovery. For the adaptive testing regime, we show that a simple scheme can find all defective items in at most $K$ tests, which is optimal. For the non-adaptive setting, we first come up with a necessary and sufficient condition for any collection of tests to be feasible for recovering all the defectives. Using this, we show that any feasible non-adaptive strategy requires at least $\Omega(K^2)$ tests. In terms of achievability, it is easy to show the existence of a feasible collection of $O(K^2 \log (N/K))$ tests. We show via carefully constructed explicit designs that one can do significantly better for constant $K$. While the cases $K = 1, 2$ are straightforward, the case $K=3$ is already non-trivial and we come up with an iterative design that is asymptotically optimal and requires $\Theta(\log \log N)$ tests. Note that this is in contrast to standard binary group testing, where at least $\Omega(\log N)$ tests are required. For constant $K \ge 3$, our iterative design requires only poly$(\log \log N)$ tests.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>

Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal Capacity-Distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point system with Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) for communication and Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) for sensing within an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal Rate-Distortion (R-D) region and explore several Inner (IB) and Outer Bounds (OB). We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable Rate-Cram\'er-Rao Bound (R-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: i) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm (BAA)-type method, and ii) a memory-efficient Closed-Form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>Hypergame Theory for Decentralized Resource Allocation in Multi-user Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SC) is an emerging communication paradigm in which wireless devices can send only relevant information from a source of data while relying on computing resources to regenerate missing data points. However, the design of a multi-user SC system becomes more challenging because of the computing and communication overhead required for coordination. Existing solutions for learning the semantic language and performing resource allocation often fail to capture the computing and communication tradeoffs involved in multiuser SC. To address this gap, a novel framework for decentralized computing and communication resource allocation in multiuser SC systems is proposed. The challenge of efficiently allocating communication and computing resources (for reasoning) in a decentralized manner to maximize the quality of task experience for the end users is addressed through the application of Stackelberg hyper game theory. Leveraging the concept of second-level hyper games, novel analytical formulations are developed to model misperceptions of the users about each other's communication and control strategies. Further, equilibrium analysis of the learned resource allocation protocols examines the convergence of the computing and communication strategies to a local Stackelberg equilibria, considering misperceptions. Simulation results show that the proposed Stackelberg hyper game results in efficient usage of communication and computing resources while maintaining a high quality of experience for the users compared to state-of-the-art that does not account for the misperceptions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Differentially Private PCA and Estimation for Spiked Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating a covariance matrix and its associated principal components is a fundamental problem in contemporary statistics. While optimal estimation procedures have been developed with well-understood properties, the increasing demand for privacy preservation introduces new complexities to this classical problem. In this paper, we study optimal differentially private Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and covariance estimation within the spiked covariance model. We precisely characterize the sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors under this model and establish the minimax rates of convergence for estimating both the principal components and covariance matrix. These rates hold up to logarithmic factors and encompass general Schatten norms, including spectral norm, Frobenius norm, and nuclear norm as special cases. We propose computationally efficient differentially private estimators and prove their minimax optimality for sub-Gaussian distributions, up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, matching minimax lower bounds are established. Notably, compared to the existing literature, our results accommodate a diverging rank, a broader range of signal strengths, and remain valid even when the sample size is much smaller than the dimension, provided the signal strength is sufficiently strong. Both simulation studies and real data experiments demonstrate the merits of our method.</description>

      <title>Personalised Outfit Recommendation via History-aware Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the history-aware transformer (HAT), a transformer-based model that uses shoppers' purchase history to personalise outfit predictions. The aim of this work is to recommend outfits that are internally coherent while matching an individual shopper's style and taste. To achieve this, we stack two transformer models, one that produces outfit representations and another one that processes the history of purchased outfits for a given shopper. We use these models to score an outfit's compatibility in the context of a shopper's preferences as inferred from their previous purchases. During training, the model learns to discriminate between purchased and random outfits using 3 losses: the focal loss for outfit compatibility typically used in the literature, a contrastive loss to bring closer learned outfit embeddings from a shopper's history, and an adaptive margin loss to facilitate learning from weak negatives. Together, these losses enable the model to make personalised recommendations based on a shopper's purchase history.
  Our experiments on the IQON3000 and Polyvore datasets show that HAT outperforms strong baselines on the outfit Compatibility Prediction (CP) and the Fill In The Blank (FITB) tasks. The model improves AUC for the CP hard task by 15.7% (IQON3000) and 19.4% (Polyvore) compared to previous SOTA results. It further improves accuracy on the FITB hard task by 6.5% and 9.7%, respectively. We provide ablation studies on the personalisation, constrastive loss, and adaptive margin loss that highlight the importance of these modelling choices.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence in Hilbert's Projective Metric for Computing Augustin Information and a R\'{e}nyi Information Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the problems of computing the Augustin information and a R\'{e}nyi information measure of statistical independence, previously explored by Lapidoth and Pfister (IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2018) and Tomamichel and Hayashi (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 64(2):1064--1082, 2018). Both quantities are defined as solutions to optimization problems and lack closed-form expressions. This paper analyzes two iterative algorithms: Augustin's fixed-point iteration for computing the Augustin information, and the algorithm by Kamatsuka et al. (arXiv:2404.10950) for the R\'{e}nyi information measure. Previously, it was only known that these algorithms converge asymptotically. We establish the linear convergence of Augustin's algorithm for the Augustin information of order $\alpha \in (1/2, 1) \cup (1, 3/2)$ and Kamatsuka et al.'s algorithm for the R\'{e}nyi information measure of order $\alpha \in [1/2, 1) \cup (1, \infty)$, using Hilbert's projective metric.</description>
