      <title>Intrinsic Attractive and Repulsive Interactions: From Classical to Quantum Gases in the Generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic parameter space is flat for an ideal classical gas with non-interacting particles. In contrast, for an ideal quantum Bose (Fermi) gas, the thermodynamic curvature is positive (negative), indicating intrinsic attractive (repulsive) interactions. We generalize the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution by employing a generalized form of the exponential function, proposing the Mittag-Leffler Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution within the framework of superstatistics. We demonstrate that the generalization parameter, $\alpha$, quantifies the statistical interaction. When $\alpha = 1$, the distribution coincides with the standard classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, where no statistical interaction is present. For $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$ ($\alpha &gt; 1$), the statistical interaction is repulsive (attractive), corresponding to a negative (positive) thermodynamic curvature of the system.</description>

      <title>Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in deforested regions.</description>

      <title>Universality of the microcanonical entropy at large spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider rigorous consequences of modular invariance for two-dimensional unitary non-rational CFTs with $c &gt; 1$. Simple estimates for the torus partition function can lead to remarkably strong results. We show in particular that the spectral density of spin-$J$ operators must grow like $\exp\left( \pi \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}(c-1) J} \right)/\sqrt{2J}$ in any twist interval at or above $(c-1)/12$, with a known twist-dependent prefactor. This proves that the large $J$ spectrum becomes dense even without averaging over spins. For twists below $(c-1)/12$ we establish that the growth must be strictly slower. Finally, we estimate how fast the maximal gap between two spin-$J$ operators must go to zero as $J$ becomes large.</description>

      <title>Sequential Generation of Two-dimensional Super-area-law States with Local Parent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct examples of highly entangled two-dimensional states by exploiting a correspondence between stochastic processes in $d$ dimensions and quantum states in $d+1$ dimensions. The entanglement structure of these states, which we explicitly calculate, can be tuned between area law, sub-volume law, and volume law. This correspondence also enables a sequential generation protocol: the states can be prepared through a series of unitary transformations acting on an auxiliary system. We also discuss the conditions under which these states have local, frustration-free parent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>

      <title>Neighbor-induced damage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider neighbor-induced damage percolation, a model describing systems where the inactivation of some elements may damage their neighboring active ones, making them unusable. We present an exact solution for the size of the giant usable component (GUC) and the giant damaged component (GDC) in uncorrelated random graphs. We show that, even for strongly heterogeneous distributions, the GUC always appears at a finite threshold and its formation is characterized by homogeneous mean-field percolation critical exponents. The threshold is a nonmonotonic function of connectivity: robustness is maximized by networks with finite optimal average degree. We also show that, if the average degree is large enough, a damaged phase appears, characterized by the existence of a GDC, bounded by two distinct percolation transitions. The birth and the dismantling of the GDC are characterized by standard percolation critical exponents in networks, except for the dismantling in scale-free networks where new critical exponents are found. Numerical simulations on regular lattices in D = 2 show that the existence of a GDC depends not only on the spatial dimension but also on the lattice coordination number.</description>

      <title>Annealing Approximation in Master-Node Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters - R measuring right-oriented influence and L measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Quantum Geometry Near the Non-Hermitian Topological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of quantum states can be an indicator of criticality, yet it remains less explored under non-Hermitian topological conditions. In this work, we unveil diverse scalings of the quantum geometry over the ground state manifold close to different topological phase transitions in a non-Hermitian long-range extension of the Kitaev chain. The derivative of the geometric phase, as well as its scaling behavior, shows that systems with different long-range couplings can belong to distinct universality classes. Near certain criticalities, we further find that the Wannier state correlation function associated with extended Berry connection of the ground state exhibits spatially anomalous behaviors. Finally, we analyze the scaling of the quantum geometric tensor near phase transitions across exceptional points, shedding light on the emergence of novel universality classes.</description>

      <title>O(5) multicriticality in the 3D two flavor SU(2) lattice gauge Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the multicritical behavior of the three dimensional lattice system in which a SU(2) gauge field is coupled to two flavors of scalar fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this system a multicritical point is present, where the global symmetry O(2)$\oplus$O(3) gets enlarged to O(5). Such a symmetry enlargement is hindered for generic systems by the instability of the O(5) multicritical point, but the SU(2) gauge symmetry prevents the appearance of the term triggering the instability. All the numerical results obtained in this lattice gauge model fully support the expectations coming from the O(2)$\oplus$O(3) multicritical Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theory, and we discuss possible implications of these results for some models of deconfined quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of a quantum system induced by a collision with a quantum particle, using the time-independent framework of scattering theory. After deriving the dynamical map for the quantum system, we show that the unitary contribution to the dynamics defines a non-perturbative response function obeying a general fluctuation-dissipation relation. We show that Kubo's formula emerges autonomously in the Born approximation, where the time-dependent perturbation is determined by particle's evolution through the potential region.</description>

      <title>Average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem in a constrained pure Gaussian state ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrized by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.</description>

Abstract: Properties of universality have essential relevance for the theory of random matrices usually called the Wigner ensemble. The issue was analysed up to recent years with detailed and relevant results. We present a slightly different view and compare the large-$n$ limit of connected correlators of distinct ensembles: universality has steps or degrees, precisely counted by the number of probability moments of the matrix entries, which match among distinct ensembles.</description>

Abstract: Non-EQuilibrium (NEQ) statistical physics has not had the same general foundation as that of EQuilibrium (EQ) statistical physics, where forces are derived from potentials such as $1/T = \partial S/\partial U$, and from which other key mathematical relations follow. Here, we show how general NEQ principles can be derived from two corresponding laws. Maximizing path entropy replaces maximizing state entropy. Whereas EQ can entail observables $(U, V, N)$, dynamics has (node populations, edge traffic, cycle flux). We derive forces of NEQ, fluctuation-susceptibility equalities, Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations, and we generalize to ``cost-benefit'' relations beyond just work and heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Force-Flow Relations in Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a companion paper [arXiv:2410.09277], we outlined a general theory for nonequilibrium (NEQ) network statistical physics, $\textit{Caliber Force Theory}$, (CFT). It resembles the "First and Second Laws" basis of Equilibrium (EQ) Thermodynamics, except that dynamics requires maximization of $\textit{path entropy}$ ($\mathfrak{S}_\text{path}$), not $\textit{state entropy}$. Here, we elaborate the mathematics of the forces $(\text{d} \mathfrak{S}_\text{path}/\text{d}{\textbf{x}})$, the fluctuation-respond relations, and the Maxwell-Onsager-like symmetry relations. And we give applications beyond thermal baths -- such as networks in ecology, biochemistry, vehicle traffic, and other force-flow networks. Beyond past work on inequalities, it gives equalities; and it gives forces, which allows for studies of optimization, conflicts, congestion and network design; and it gives a third Kirchhoff-like relation that applies to networks that have fluctuating flows.</description>

Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Universal Acceleration of Quantum Relaxation by Reset-Induced Mpemba Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a universal quantum reset protocol that enables exponential acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems. The protocol induces a quantum Mpemba effect, wherein systems initialized farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to it, and crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol eliminates multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling quantum relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</description>

Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically strain recovery within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, significant further strain recovery then occurs more slowly via the plastic yielding of elements with negative local stresses, opposite to that of the original shear. We elucidate the mechanism that underlies this behaviour, in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements. In particular, we show that the initial fast elastic recoil brings to a state of negative local stress those elements that had yielded during the forward straining while the load was applied. The subsequent delayed plastic yielding of these elements with negative stress is the origin of the slow ongoing strain recovery. In this way, counterintuitively, elements that had yielded plastically while the load was applied still contribute significantly to strain recovery after the sample is unloaded. This finding has important consequences for constitutive modeling, because such behaviour can only arise in a constitutive model that evolves a full distribution of local stresses (or multiple moments of such a distribution), rather than a single average stress.</description>

      <title>Exact Spin Correlators of Integrable Quantum Circuits from Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range. Our Python implementation is available at https://github.com/KenHino/Pompon.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.</description>

      <title>Three-local Conserved Charge Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the conservation of a local charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This establishes Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture as a theorem, ending the folklore that the existence of higher conserved charges imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>
