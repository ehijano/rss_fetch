      <title>On the Complexity of Combinatorial Optimization on Fixed Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization can be described as the problem of finding a feasible subset that maximizes a objective function. The paper discusses combinatorial optimization problems, where for each dimension the set of feasible subsets is fixed. It is demonstrated that in some cases fixing the structure makes the problem easier, whereas in general the problem remains NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVO): Application to Multimodal Function Optimization and Noise Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metaheuristic optimization technique attained more awareness for handling complex optimization problems. Over the last few years, numerous optimization techniques have been developed that are inspired by natural phenomena. Recently, the propagation of the new COVID-19 implied a burden on the public health system to suffer several deaths. Vaccination, masks, and social distancing are the major steps taken to minimize the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. Considering the social distance to combat the coronavirus epidemic, a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization model is proposed in this work, and it is termed as Social Distancing Induced Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm (COVO). The pace of propagation of the coronavirus can indeed be slowed by maintaining social distance. Thirteen benchmark functions are used to evaluate the COVO performance for discrete, continuous, and complex problems, and the COVO model performance is compared with other well-known optimization algorithms. The main motive of COVO optimization is to obtain a global solution to various applications by solving complex problems with faster convergence. At last, the validated results depict that the proposed COVO optimization has a reasonable and acceptable performance.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Multivariate Polynomial Factoring for Low Degree Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polynomial $f$ from a class $\mathcal{C}$ of polynomials, we show that the problem to compute all the constant degree irreducible factors of $f$ reduces in polynomial time to polynomial identity tests (PIT) for class $\mathcal{C}$ and divisibility tests of $f$ by constant degree polynomials. We apply the result to several classes $\mathcal{C}$ and obtain the constant degree factors in \begin{enumerate}
  \item
  polynomial time, for $\mathcal{C}$ being polynomials that have only constant degree factors,
  \item
  quasipolynomial time, for $\mathcal{C}$ being sparse polynomials,
  \item
  subexponential time, for $\mathcal{C}$ being polynomials that have constant-depth circuits. \end{enumerate} Result 2 and 3 were already shown by Kumar, Ramanathan, and Saptharishi with a different proof and their time complexities necessarily depend on black-box PITs for a related bigger class $\mathcal{C}'$. Our complexities vary on whether the input is given as a blackbox or whitebox.
  We also show that the problem to compute the sparse factors of polynomial from a class $\mathcal{C}$ reduces in polynomial time to PIT for class $\mathcal{C}$, divisibility tests of $f$ by sparse polynomials, and irreducibility preserving bivariate projections for sparse polynomials. For $\mathcal{C}$ being sparse polynomials, it follows that it suffices to derandomize irreducibility preserving bivariate projections for sparse polynomials in order to compute all the sparse irreducible factors efficiently. When we consider factors of sparse polynomials that are sums of univariate polynomials, a subclass of sparse polynomials, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm. This was already shown by Volkovich with a different proof.</description>

      <title>Outer-(ap)RAC Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{outer-RAC drawing} of a graph is a straight-line drawing where all vertices are incident to the outer cell and all edge crossings occur at a right angle. If additionally, all crossing edges are either horizontal or vertical, we call the drawing \emph{outer-apRAC} (\emph{ap} for \emph{axis-parallel)}. A graph is outer-(ap)RAC if it admits an outer-(ap)RAC drawing. We investigate the class of outer-(ap)RAC graphs. We show that the outer-RAC graphs are a proper subset of~the planar graphs with at most $2.5n-4$ edges where $n$ is the number of vertices. This density bound is tight, even for outer-apRAC graphs. Moreover, we provide an SPQR-tree based linear-time algorithm which computes an outer-RAC drawing for every given series-parallel graph of maximum degree four. As a complementing result, we present planar graphs of maximum degree four and series-parallel graphs of maximum degree five that are not outer-RAC. Finally, for series-parallel graphs of maximum degree three we show how to compute an outer-apRAC drawing in linear time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cardinality of Grobner basis under various orderings. We identify a family of polynomials F and a criteria for the monomial orderings such that the reduced Grobner basis is double exponential in cardinality. We also show that the said criteria is satisfied by orderings such as lexicographic, degree lexicographic and weighted orderings.</description>

      <title>Small Even Covers, Locally Decodable Codes and Restricted Subgraphs of Edge-Colored Kikuchi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices, an even cover in $H$ is a collection of hyperedges that touch each vertex an even number of times. Even covers are a generalization of cycles in graphs and are equivalent to linearly dependent subsets of a system of linear equations modulo $2$. As a result, they arise naturally in the context of well-studied questions in coding theory and refuting unsatisfiable $k$-SAT formulas. Analogous to the irregular Moore bound of Alon, Hoory, and Linial (2002), in 2008, Feige conjectured an extremal trade-off between the number of hyperedges and the length of the smallest even cover in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. This conjecture was recently settled up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of hyperedges (Guruswami, Kothari, and Manohar 2022 and Hsieh, Kothari, and Mohanty 2023). These works introduce the new technique that relates hypergraph even covers to cycles in the associated Kikuchi graphs. Their analysis of these Kikuchi graphs, especially for odd $k$, is rather involved and relies on matrix concentration inequalities.
  In this work, we give a simple and purely combinatorial argument that recovers the best-known bound for Feige's conjecture for even $k$. We also introduce a novel variant of a Kikuchi graph which together with this argument improves the logarithmic factor in the best-known bounds for odd $k$. As an application of our ideas, we also give a purely combinatorial proof of the improved lower bounds (Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, 2023) on 3-query binary linear locally decodable codes.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for the Kneser Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ is defined for integers $n$ and $k$ with $n \geq 2k$ as the graph whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. A classical result of Lov\'asz asserts that the chromatic number of $K(n,k)$ is $n-2k+2$. In the computational Kneser problem, we are given an oracle access to a coloring of the vertices of $K(n,k)$ with $n-2k+1$ colors, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We present a randomized algorithm for the Kneser problem with running time $n^{O(1)} \cdot k^{O(k)}$. This shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k$. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs.
  We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of $m$ items to a group of $\ell$ agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances that satisfy $\ell \geq m - O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with an extended access to the input coloring.</description>

      <title>QMA vs. QCMA and Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>
