      <title>Simplified equations for the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simplified version of the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model is derived. The SLT-QE5 approximation reduces the number of differential equations from seven to five. Numerical calculations show that the approximation is very good for various trap parameters except the case with large reduction of activation energy during recombination to adjacent hole together with very low retrapping coefficient.</description>

      <title>Recent Advancements in the Development of Two-dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their potential application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the recent advancements in atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) and their potential applications in various fields, including nanoelectronics, photonics, sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronics. Specifically, the focus is on TMDs such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2, promising for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics devices based on ultra-thin atomic layers. One of the main challenges in utilising TMDs for practical applications is the scalable production of defect-free materials on desired substrates. However, innovative growth strategies have been developed to address this issue and meet the growing demand for high-quality and controllable TMD materials. These strategies are compatible with conventional and unconventional substrates, opening up new possibilities for practical implementation. Furthermore, the article highlights the development of novel 2D TMDs with unique functionalities and remarkable chemistry. These advancements contribute to expanding the range of applications and capabilities of TMD materials, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with these ultra-thin layers. In addition to electronics, the article delves into the significant efforts dedicated to exploring the potential of 2D TMDs in energy and sensor applications. These materials have shown promising characteristics for energy storage and have been extensively studied for their sensing capabilities, showcasing their versatility and potential impact in these fields. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in 2D TMDs, emphasising their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. The continuous research and development in this area is promising for advancing these materials and their integration into practical devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <title>Nature of the Topological Transition of the Kitaev Model in [111] Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of heat transport and optical non-coherence: an experimental demonstration of the analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrow of time problem remains one of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. We investigate one particular example of this problem: the irreversibility of heat transfer through an interface between two materials. This special case turned out to be much simpler than that of transport phenomena in bulk materials. We start by exploring a mechanism that turns equations of reversible, unitary transmission of wave-particles through the interface into irreversible equations, describing the distribution functions at the interface. This mechanism, non-coherence, is treated in an analogy with wave optics: no real waves are absolutely monochromatic and thus have finite temporal coherence. We find an experimental setup to prove the suggested mechanism and calculate the optimal parameters to observe the phenomenon. We conduct an experiment whose results fully agree with the predictions of our theory. In the final discussion, we revisit the connection with heat transport through a material interface and show that only the suggested mechanism can explain the irreversibility of interfacial transport.</description>
