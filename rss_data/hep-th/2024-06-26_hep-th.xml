      <title>Four-point functions and contact terms from higher-spin Ward identities of Chern-Simons-matter theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large $N$ quasifermionic Chern-Simons-matter theories exhibit weakly-broken higher-spin symmetry and contain an infinite-dimensional algebra of almost-conserved higher-spin currents. By analyzing local higher-spin Ward identities, we constrain the higher-spin algebra of this theory, for operators of spin $s&lt;4$. The solution interpolates smoothly between Ward identities of free fermionic and critical bosonic $U(N)$ models, in accordance with the bosonization duality. At finite 't Hooft coupling, we decompose four-point current correlators involving $(\partial\cdot J_3)^{QF}$ in terms of free theory structures. Additionally, we find that higher correlators of the theory develop scheme-independent higher-spin contact terms, stemming from the presence of a background Chern-Simons term in the effective action. These terms are related to similar contact terms of the associated quasibosonic Chern-Simons-matter theory via Legendre transform. The results are supplemented by perturbative checks, including collinear limit computations of $\langle T_{--}J_+J_+\rangle_{QF}$, $\langle T_{--}J_+J_+O\rangle_{QF}$ and $\langle J_{ -- }J_+J_+J_+\rangle_{QF}$.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Spin Particles, On Shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles. Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorization (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorization, analyticity, or others. We show that continuous-spin particle dynamics may approximate gravity and electromagnetism in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>

      <title>A CFT dual for evaporating black holes: boundary continuous matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network states, especially Matrix Product States (MPS), are crucial tools for studying how particles in large quantum systems are entangled with each other. MPS are particularly effective for modeling systems in one-dimensional space. Their continuous version, known as continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS), extends this approach to more complex quantum field theories that describe systems with an infinite number of interacting particles. This paper introduces a novel extension, boundary continuous Matrix Product States (BCMPS), which incorporate boundary states from conformal field theory (CFT). We construct BCMPS and explore their potential holographic duals, linking them to black hole microstates with end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT. This connection hints at a deeper relationship between tensor networks and spacetime geometry, potentially offering new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravity.</description>

      <title>Analytic bounds on late-time axion-scalar cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Meson scattering in a non-minimally Lorentz-violating scalar QED at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study meson scattering in a non-minimally Lorentz-violating scalar QED at finite temperature. The meson scatterings were investigated in tree level and the finite temperature effects were addressed by using the thermofield dynamics formalism. We have considered three types of scattering, namely, meson-antimeson of $a$-type into meson-antimeson of $b$-type, meson-antimeson of $a$-type into meson-antimeson of $a$-type and meson-meson of $a$-type into meson-meson of $a$-type. For each scattering we have computed the cross section in order to investigate the influence of the finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Small Circle Expansion for Adjoint QCD$_2$ with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $1+1$-dimensional $\text{SU}(N)$ gauge theory coupled to one adjoint multiplet of Majorana fermions on a small spatial circle of circumference $L$. Using periodic boundary conditions, we derive the effective action for the quantum mechanics of the holonomy and the fermion zero modes in perturbation theory up to order $(gL)^3$. When the adjoint fermion mass-squared is tuned to $g^2 N/(2\pi)$, the effective action is found to be an example of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a nontrivial superpotential. We separate the states into the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ center symmetry sectors (universes) labeled by $p=0, \ldots, N-1$ and show that in one of the sectors the supersymmetry is unbroken, while in the others it is broken spontaneously. These results give us new insights into the $(1,1)$ supersymmetry of adjoint QCD$_2$, which has previously been established using light-cone quantization. When the adjoint mass is set to zero, our effective Hamiltonian does not depend on the fermions at all, so that there are $2^{N-1}$ degenerate sectors of the Hilbert space. This construction appears to provide an explicit realization of the extended symmetry of the massless model, where there are $2^{2N-2}$ operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. We also generalize our results to other gauge groups $G$, for which supersymmetry is found at the adjoint mass-squared $g^2 h^\vee/(2\pi)$, where $h^\vee$ is the dual Coxeter number of $G$.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Worldline Proper Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical observer can measure elapsed proper time along their worldline. When observers are coupled to a system with internal correlations, measurements of elapsed time may inherit these correlations. We show that derivatives of the on-shell action with respect to worldline mass compute correlation functions of worldline proper length at tree level. We study worldlines coupled to a scalar field. We calculate the length-length two-point function and find it arises from correlated path fluctuations. As an application, we propose that the logarithm of local correlators serves as a generating function of length correlators, which generalizes the on-shell action prescription. Using this proposal, we extract AdS worldline observables from local CFT correlators as computed by Witten diagrams. We briefly discuss extensions to gravity, interferometers, and the holographic encoding of observer time.</description>

      <title>IR physics from the holographic RG flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the holographic method, we investigate an RG flow and IR physics holographically when a two-dimensional conformal field theory is deformed by a relevant scalar operator. To do so, we first assume an RG flow from a UV to new IR CFT. On the dual gravity side, such an RG flow can be described by rolling down of a bulk scalar field from an unstable to stable equilibrium point. After considering a simple scalar potential allowing several local extrema, we study the change of a ground state along the RG flow. We show that the entanglement entropy at an IR fixed point leads to a logarithmic divergence due to restoring of the conformal symmetry. We study how the change of the ground state affects two-point functions. In the probe limit, we numerically calculate the change of a conformal dimension caused by the modification of the ground state. We further study the analytic form of the IR conformal dimension which is perfectly matched to the numerical result.</description>

      <title>Elko as an inflaton candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elko is a spin-half fermion with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy and Klein-Gordon dynamics. In this paper, we show that in a spatially flat FLRW space-time, slow-roll inflation can be initiated by the homogeneous Elko fields. The inflaton is a composite scalar field obtained by contracting the spinor field with its dual. This is possible because the background evolution as described by the Friedmann equation is completely determined by the scalar field. This approach has the advantage that we do not need to specify the initial conditions for every component of the spinor fields. We derive the equation of motion for the inflaton and also show that this solution is an attractor.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation of Hawking radiations for mass-superposed BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies using the Unruh-DeWitt detector model have revealed the quantum signatures of black hole mass superposition. In this paper, we use the equal-time density-density correlation function to reinvestigate the mass superposition of BTZ black holes. Interestingly, the quantum signatures of BTZ black hole mass superposition can be revealed by the equal-time density-density correlation peaks. Additionally, different mass superpositions for the same mass ratio can be distinguished, a phenomenon not previously documented. Specifically, the correlation function method can pinpoint the location where Hawking radiations are generated, even for mass-superposed BTZ black holes. Our findings indicate that this location is approximately at two and a half times the radius of the horizon, where the correlation function reaches its maximum.This supports the concept of a quantum atmosphere as the origin locus of Hawking radiation,even in quantum-superposed spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional (bi-)scalar gravities from four-dimensional Horndeski</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a classical two-dimensional bi-scalar gravity based on the Kaluza-Klein reduction applied to the four-dimensional Horndeski theory. One of the scalar fields arises from the original four-dimensional theory, while the extra scalar emerges from the reduction process. We also introduce a two-dimensional bi-scalar identity that allows for a more concise and elegant reformulation of the resulting bi-scalar Lagrangian. Additionally, we study the linear perturbations around a static background to demonstrate that the bi-scalar theory may support a single healthy propagating mode. Furthermore, by restricting the scalar fields, we investigate a general single scalar theory that is identical to the two-dimensional Horndeski theory up to a boundary term. Our results provide a framework to map a generic two-dimensional dilaton gravity into four-dimensional Horndeski theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate pulsating string solutions within the context of a two-parameter $\chi$-deformed $\mathcal{R} \times S^2$ background. We derive the energy and oscillation number relation for the deformed $\mathcal{R} \times S^2$ in a short string limit. Additionally, we derive the first-order perturbation equation for a pulsating string in this specific background. As a special case of the two-parameter deformed background, we examine the stability of the pulsating string solution in one-parameter deformed $\mathcal{R} \times S^2$ and $AdS_3$ background by setting one of the deformation parameters to zero.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian conformal scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantization of Carrollian conformal scalar theories, including two-dimensional(2D) magnetic scalar and three-dimensional(3D) electric and magnetic scalars. We discuss two different quantization schemes, depending on the choice of the vacuum. We show that the standard canonical quantization corresponding to the induced vacuum yields a unitary Hilbert space and the 2-point correlation functions in this scheme match exactly with the ones computed from the path integral. In the canonical quantization, the BMS symmetry can be realized without anomaly. On the other hand, for the quantization based on the highest-weight vacuum, it does not have a unitary Hilbert space. In 2D, the correlators in the highest-weight vacuum agree with the ones obtained by taking the $c\to 0$ limit of the 2D CFT, and there is an anomalous term in the commutation relations between the Virasoso generators, whose form is similar to the one in 2D CFT. In 3D, there is no good definition of the highest-weight vacuum without breaking the rotational symmetry. In our study, we find that the usual state-operator correspondence in CFT does not hold in the Carrollian case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the duality between gravitational dynamics and fluids living on dynamical surfaces carrying multiple charges, known as the blackfold approach, to perturbativaly construct new asymptotically global (Anti)-de Sitter multi-spinning, non-extremal, multi-charged black holes in theories of higher-dimensional gravity minimally coupled to a dilaton and higher-form gauge fields in spacetime dimensions $D\ge5$, and new asymptotically AdS$_{l}\times S^{m}$ black holes in type IIB and eleven-dimensional supergravity. These solutions include the generalisation of the Kerr-Newman solution to (A)dS carrying either electric or string charge, generalisations of black rings to higher-dimensions with $\mathbb{S}^p\times \mathbb{S}^{n+1}$ horizon topology, static de Sitter solutions carrying arbitrary $q$-brane charge, as well as various asymptotically AdS$_{l}\times S^{m}$ multi-charged and multi-spinning black hole solutions, some of which correspond to novel thermal states in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Counting of surfaces and computational complexity in column sums of symmetric group character tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The character table of the symmetric group $S_n$, of permutations of $n$ objects, is of fundamental interest in theoretical physics, combinatorics as well as computational complexity theory. We investigate the implications of an identity, which has a geometrical interpretation in combinatorial topological field theories, relating the column sum of normalised central characters of $S_n$ to a sum of structure constants of multiplication in the centre of the group algebra of $S_n$. The identity leads to the proof that a combinatorial computation of the column sum belongs to complexity class \shP. The sum of structure constants has an interpretation in terms of the counting of branched covers of the sphere. This allows the identification of a tractable subset of the structure constants related to genus zero covers. We use this subset to prove that the column sum for a conjugacy class labelled by partition $\lambda$ is non-vanishing if and only if the permutations in the conjugacy class are even. This leads to the result that the determination of the vanishing or otherwise of the column sum is in complexity class \pP. The subset gives a positive lower bound on the column sum for any even $ \lambda$. For any disjoint decomposition of $ \lambda$ as $\lambda_1 \sqcup \lambda_2 $ we obtain a lower bound for the column sum at $ \lambda$ in terms of the product of the column sums for $ \lambda_1$ and$\lambda_2$. This can be expressed as a super-additivity property for the logarithms of column sums of normalized characters.</description>

Abstract: We argue that a general system of scalar fields and gauge fields manifesting vacuum degeneracy induces a principal groupoid bundle over spacetime and that the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism are encoded by the singular foliation canonically induced on the moduli space of scalar vacuum expectation values by the Lie groupoid structure. Recent mathematical results in the classification of singular foliations then provide a qualitative classification of the possible patterns of vacuum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Systematic integral evaluation for spin-resummed binary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Spurious gauge-invariance and $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensional regularization is arguably the most popular and efficient scheme for multi-loop calculations. Yet, when applied to chiral (gauge) theories like the Standard Model and its extensions, one is forced to deal with the infamous "$\gamma_5$ problem". The only formulation that has been demonstrated to be consistent at all orders in perturbation theory, known as Breiteinlhoner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme, is rather cumbersome because of the lack of manifest chiral gauge-invariance. In this paper we point out that this drawback can be alleviated by the introduction of auxiliary fields that restore a spurious version of gauge-invariance. If combined with the background field method, all 1PI amplitudes and the associated counterterms are formally covariant and thus severely constrained by the symmetries. As an illustration we evaluate the symmetry-restoring counterterms at 1-loop in the most general renormalizable gauge theory with Dirac fermions and scalar fields, the Standard Model representing a particular example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators: A View from the Corner Charge Fluctuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, within a finite region is a powerful approach to characterizing quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that the corner charge fluctuation reveals universal information even for generic $\textit{lattice}$ systems of non-interacting electrons. We first prove that universal angle-dependence can be recovered in the $\textit{small-angle}$ limit for proper partitions of the lattice, from which the integrated Fubini-Study quantum metric can be extracted. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically. Numerical verification is presented for various Chern insulator models, demonstrating the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, we highlight a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Time Non-locality in Dark Matter and LSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the intriguing phenomenon of time non-locality in the evolution of dark matter and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently in\,\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\Pi$ basis\,\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.</description>

      <title>Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>The Laplace Transform and Quantum Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. As an application, the quantum spectral curve for the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line is derived directly from the theory of TR. The results seem to suggest a link between the topological recursion and the Gromov-Witten invariants of the weighted complex projective line $\mathbb{P}[r]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed as the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The rest of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Non-canonical $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work comprises a study of the thermodynamic behavior of modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, which had been developed based on a non-canonical theory known as K-essence theory. In this development, we use the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) type of non-standard Lagrangian. We develop a modified first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity, where we consider the background metric to be the usual Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) type. A graphical analysis of surface gravity has been performed for the modified FLRW metric via the $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ theory, which is different from the usual FLRW gravity through the usual $f(R,T)$ gravity. In the study of the thermodynamic behavior of the cosmos, we use two distinct kinds of scale factors: exponential and power law. Through the investigation of the modified GSLT, we have seen that during the initial phase of the universe, the entropy's rate of change may be either negative or positive, contingent upon the value of the curvature constant. The negativity of the entropy change indicates that the modified GSLT is not feasible in that particular area for a particular curvature constant. These traits suggest that during the inflationary period, entropy might have been either negative or positive. It has also been seen that entropy saturates every curvature value at different time ranges, which indicates the heat death of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the input of an oriented three-dimensional TFT with framed line defects and a commutative $\Delta$-separable Frobenius algebra $A$ in the ribbon category of these line defects, we construct a three-dimensional spin TFT. The framed line defects of the spin TFT are labelled by certain equivariant modules over $A$, and the spin structure may or may not extend to a given line defect. Physically the spin TFT can be interpreted as the result of gauging a one-form symmetry in the original oriented TFT. This spin TFT extends earlier constructions in Blanchet-Masbaum (1996) and Blanchet (2005) [arXiv:math/0303240], and it reproduces the classification of abelian spin Chern-Simons theories in Belov-Moore (2005) [arXiv:hep-th/0505235].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of linearized quantum gravity, we study the quantum gravitational interaction between two nonpointlike objects induced by fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that, in addition to the quantum gravitational interaction induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric fields previously studied, there exists a quantum gravitomagnetic interaction. This interaction originates from the interaction between the instantaneous localized mass currents in nonpointlike objects induced by the fluctuating gravitomagnetic fields. Using fourth-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit form of the quantum gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows an $r^{-10}$ dependence in the near regime and an $r^{-11}$ dependence in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. This interaction energy is expected to be significant when the gravitomagnetic polarizability of the objects is large.</description>

Abstract: In an attempt to understand the origin and robustness of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropic functional, we adopt a geometric approach and discuss the implications of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and of Dvoretzky's theorem on convex bodies for the choice of this functional form. We contrast these results with a more recent result on flowers of balls, which may be interpreted as suggesting the use of power-law entropies for some systems.</description>

      <title>Space-time symmetry breaking on non-geodesic leaves and a new form of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the permanent damage caused by the historical breakdown of full diffeomorphism invariance induced by a foliation. We focus on the case where the foliation is allowed to be non-geodesic after the interactions with the foliation switch off. Gravity and other forms of matter recover full diffeomorphism invariance only at the expense of introducing a new matter-like component, carrying the non-vanishing Hamiltonian (and momentum) left over from the violating past interactions. This matter form must be stress-free in the preferred frame, the only way a matter action can mimic the evolution of the leftover Hamiltonian (and momentum) driven by the Dirac hypersurface deformation algebra. If the preferred frame is non-geodesic, then in the preferred frame the equivalent matter component must have energy and a momentum current, but still no spatial stresses: an unusual form of "matter". It is equivalent to a fluid with anisotropic stress in some regimes, reducing to dust in others, or even displaying completely new features in extreme situations. Its stress energy tensor is conserved. We provide two examples based on accelerated frames: Rindler space-time and the canonical Schwarzchild frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum of state of a system to another using local processes, what is the probability of success? It turns out that this probability can be bounded by quantifying entanglement within both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of multipartite entanglement measures that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. The measures are constructed out of local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <title>Violation of $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$ complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source. Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result $\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$ where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$ bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars, and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1609.02926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum quenches and subsequent non-equilibrium dynamics of free Dirac fermions in 1+1 spacetime dimensions using time dependent mass. The final state is a normalized boundary state which is called generalized Calabrese-Cardy (gCC) state and the system thermalizes to a generalized Gibb's Ensemble(GGE). We can also tune the initial states so that the final states are exact Calabrese-Cardy (CC) state and special gCC states. The system in the CC state thermalizes to a Gibb's ensemble. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the growth of entanglement entropy of subsystems consisting of arbitrary number of disjoint intervals in CC state. We show that the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows monotonically before saturation. In case of certain gCC states, for particular charges, the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows non-monotonically when the effective chemical potential is increased beyond a critical value. We argue that the non-monotonic growth of entanglement entropy is due to increase in long range correlation and decrease in short range correlation at early times.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a realization of dark dimension. We consider the 5D standard model coupling to gravity with one dimension compactified on an orbifold, which is seen as dark dimension of size R. We stabilize the radion by casimir effect wrapping around compact dimension and recover the neutrino mass and 4D cosmological constant with the observed value. Orbifold can lead to a natural resolution of chirality problem in 5D at low energy, which we briefly discussed in the paper. Although we found that the radion mass is too light to survive under solar system tests of GR, several screening mechanisms might give us a solution, for example, Chameleon mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work challenges the conventional notion that in spacetime dimension higher than one, a supersymmetric Lagrangian invariably consists of purely bosonic terms, purely fermionic terms, as well as boson-fermion mixing terms. By recasting a relativistic Lagrangian in terms of its non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic sectors, we reveal that an ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) supersymmetric Lagrangian can exist without a purely bosonic contribution. Based on this result, we demonstrate a link between higher-dimensional Carrollian and (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanical models, yielding higher-order extensions of supersymmetric SYK models in which purely bosonic higher order terms are absent. Given that supersymmetry plays an essential role in improving the quantum behavior and solubility, our findings may lead to interesting applications in non-AdS holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a regular bound state of two extremal black holes in type IIB supergravity with opposite charges. The bound state resembles the Schwarzschild black hole from the asymptotics to the photon ring and has the same mass and charges as the Schwarzschild black hole. On the one hand, we show that the bound-state entropy admits a microscopic description in terms of branes and antibranes in string theory. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the entropy approaches half of the Schwarzschild entropy as the mass becomes significantly larger than the Kaluza-Klein scales used to regularize the geometry. This opens up the possibility of a brane/antibrane interpretation of the Schwarzschild entropy in string theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate self-gravitating solutions of the Einstein-Skyrme theory coupled to spin-isospin Dirac fermions and consider the dependence of the spectral flow on the effective gravitational coupling constant and on the Yukawa coupling. It is shown that the effects of the backreaction of the fermionic mode may strongly deform the configuration. Depending on the choice of parameters, solutions with positive, negative and zero ADM mass may arise. The occurrence of regular anti-gravitating asymptotically flat solutions with negative ADM mass is caused by the violation of the energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent study of DSSYK and the non-commutative nature of its bulk dual, we review and analyze an example of a non-commutative spacetime known as the quantum disk proposed by L. Vaksman. The quantum disk is defined as the space whose isometries are generated by the quantum algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{su}_{1,1})$. We review how this algebra is defined and its associated group $SU_q(1,1)$ that it generates, highlighting its non-trivial coproduct that sources bulk non-commutativity. We analyze the structure of holography on the quantum disk and study the imprint of non-commutativity on the putative boundary dual.</description>

Abstract: The species scale provides a lower bound on the shortest possible length that can be probed in gravitational effective theories. It may be defined by the size of the minimal black hole in the theory and, as such, it has recently been given an interpretation along the lines of the celebrated black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we extend this interpretation to the case of charged species. We provide working definitions of minimal black holes for the case of uncharged and charged species constituents. Then, examining the modifications in the thermodynamic properties of near-extremal charged species compared to the uncharged case, we uncover interesting implications for the cosmology of an expanding universe, particularly within the context of the Dark Dimensions Scenario. Finally, we explore possible microscopic constructions in non-supersymmetric string theories in which towers of charged near-extremal species may arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we focus on the study of RG flows of conformal field theories that are holographically dual to Poincar\'e domain wall solutions in $D=3$, $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ gauged supergravity coupled to a sigma model with target space $SU(1, 1)/U(1) = H^2$. This theory is truncated to a subsector where the vector field and phase of the scalar field vanish and we consider different boundary conditions for the remaining real scalar field. The RG flows, which are mostly non-superysymmetric, are analyzed by treating the supergravity field equations as a dynamical system for the scalar field and its derivative with respect to the scale factor. Phase diagrams are constructed for different values of the parameter $a^2$, which is related to the curvature of the scalar manifold. The behavior of solutions near the boundary is used to determine their type based on the expansion of the corresponding fake superpotential. By incorporating information on the boundary conditions, the obtained RG flows are interpreted using the holographic dictionary. Numerical solutions and plots of the fake superpotential are also provided.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the presence of localized static structures in the real line, described by relativistic real scalar fields in two spacetime dimensions. We consider models featuring both standard and modified kinematics, where we employ two intriguing potentials supporting defect solutions. The first potential can transform kink into compacton in the standard framework, while the second one is based on the inflationary Starobinsky model. Interesting possibilities unseen in previous investigations are described, in particular, for the case related to the Starobinsky potential. The addressed potentials are inserted into a broader framework, and so the extended models are described by a wider set of solutions. This investigation also reveals the presence of the twinlike behavior for a specific compact configuration, which solves two distinct models.</description>

Abstract: In the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ framework, the Euclidean BTZ black hole corresponds to the dominant high-temperature phase of its dual field theory. We initially employ perturbative methods to solve the Einstein equations as boundary value problems, providing correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator at low points. Utilizing operator equations established in our previous work, we further compute arbitrary high-point correlators for the energy-momentum tensor operator in the high-temperature phase and recursive relations for these high-point functions. Concurrently, we employ the Chern-Simons formalism to derive consistent results. Further, using the cut-off AdS/$T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT duality, we calculate the energy-momentum tensor correlators, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics. Finally, stress tensor correlators enable us to ascertain the corresponding KdV operator correlators at low-temperature.</description>

Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

Abstract: Geodesics in general relativity describe the behaviour of test particles in a gravitational field. In 5D Kaluza-Klein, geodesics reproduce the Lorentz force motion of particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper studies geodesic motion on $M_4 \times K$ in the presence of general gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars. It shows that the classical mass and charge of a test particle become variable quantities when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime with massive gauge fields, such as the weak force field, or with non-constant Higgs scalars. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons can change the mass and charge of particles. The variation rates of mass and charge along a geodesic are given by natural geometric formulae. In regions where mass is preserved there are additional constants of motion, one for every abelian or simple summand in the Killing algebra of $K$. The last part of the paper discusses traditional difficulties of Kaluza-Klein models, such as the low $q / m$ ratios in the 5D model. It suggests possible ways to circumvent them. It also advocates the naturalness of a model where elementary particles always travel at the speed of light in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>New construction of a vacuum doubly rotating black ring by the Ehlers transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Ehlers transformation, we derive an exact solution for a doubly rotating black ring in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. It is well-known that the vacuum Einstein theory with three commuting Killing vector fields can be reduced to a non-linear sigma model with $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ target space symmetry. As shown previously by Giusto and Saxena, the $SO(2,1)$ subgroup in the $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ can generate a rotating solution from a static solution while preserving asymptotic flatness. This so-called Ehlers transformation actually transforms the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole into the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. However, unlike the case with the black hole, applying this method directly to the static black ring or the Emparan-Reall black ring, does not yield a regular rotating black ring due to the emergence of a Dirac-Misner string singularity. To solve this undesirable issue, we use a singular vacuum solution of a rotating black ring/lens that already possesses a Dirac-Misner string singularity as the seed solution for the Ehlers transformation. The resulting solution is regular, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that this solution obtained by the Ehlers transformation coincides precisely with the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution. We expect that applying this method to other theories may lead to the finding of new exact solutions, such as solutions for black lenses and capped black holes, as well as black ring configurations.</description>

      <title>Abelian Instantons and Monopole Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is usually assumed that $4D$ instantons can only arise in non-Abelian theories. In this paper we re-examine this conventional wisdom by explicitly constructing instantons in an Abelian gauge theory: ${\rm QED}_4$ with $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions, in the background of a Dirac monopole. This is the low-energy effective field theory for fermions interacting with a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, in the limit where the monopole is infinitely heavy (hence pointlike) and static. This theory, whose non-topological sectors were studied by Rubakov and Callan, has a far richer structure than previously explored. We show how to calculate the topological instanton number, demonstrate the existence of 't Hooft zero modes localized around such instantons, and show how instantons in the path integral provide the underlying mechanism for the Callan-Rubakov process: monopole-catalyzed baryon decay with a cross section that saturates the unitarity bound. Our computation relies on correctly identifying the relevant $2D$ EFT for monopole catalysis as Axial ${\rm QED}_2$ in an effective $AdS_2$ metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ignoring ten-dimensional heterotic gauge fields, heterotic supergravity reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus gives rise to a half-maximal supergravity coupled to $d$ vector multiplets. The reduced theory has a continuous $O(d,d;\mathbb R)/O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ symmetry that persists to all perturbative orders in the string $\alpha'$ expansion. We highlight this symmetry by explicitly reducing the bosonic sector of four-derivative heterotic supergravity as well as its fermionic supersymmetry variations. After appropriate field redefinitions, the resulting action and supersymmetry variations are manifestly $O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ invariant. This reduction allows us to explore the interplay between the gravity and vector multiplets beyond leading order, where (in our conventions) $O(d)_-$ is the supergravity R-symmetry while $O(d)_+$ is a flavor symmetry of the $d$ vector multiplets.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the Maldacena correspondence to the logarithmic conformal field theories. We study the correspondence between field theories in (d+1)-dimensional AdS space and the d-dimensional logarithmic conformal field theories in the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$. Using this correspondence, we get the n-point functions of the corresponding logarithmic conformal field theory in d-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to that for a general QECC. In the extension, instead of the classical decoders of the linear classical codes that define the CSS code, we use decoding measurements of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded.The decoding error depends on the errors of the two decoding measurements and the degree of complementarity of the CQ codes.We then demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, in which we improve decoding errors over previous approaches and further show that the black hole dynamics may be an optimal encoder for quantum information but a poor encoder for classical information.</description>

Abstract: Three major misconceptions concerning quantized tachyon fields: the energy spectrum unbounded from below, the frame-dependent and unstable vacuum state, and the non-covariant commutation rules, are shown to be a result of misrepresenting the Lorentz group in a too small Hilbert space. By doubling this space we establish an explicitly covariant framework that allows for the proper quantization of the tachyon fields eliminating all of these issues. Our scheme that is derived to maintain the relativistic covariance also singles out the two-state formalism developed by Aharonov et al. [1] as a preferred interpretation of the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy is introduced by enhancing the underlying symmetry algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)\simeq \text{q-W}_{1+\infty}$ to the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra. The difference-differential equations of the hierarchy are obtained from the expansion of $(q,t)$-bilinear identities, and two equations refining the 2d Toda equation are found in this way. The derivation of the bilinear identities follows from the isomorphism between the Fock representation of level $(2,0)$ of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and the tensor product of the q-deformed Virasoro algebra with a $u(1)$ Heisenberg algebra. It leads to identify the $(q,t)$-deformed Casimir with the screening charges of the deformed Virasoro algebra. Due to the non-trivial coproduct, equations of the hierarchy no longer involve a single tau-function, but instead relate a set of different tau functions. We then define the universal refined tau function using the $L$-matrix of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and interpret it as the generating function of the deformed tau functions. The equations of the hierarchy, written in terms of the universal refined tau function, combine into two-term quadratic equations similar to the $RLL$ equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the 3D Ising Transition on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009 (2023)]. By introducing an additional $SU(2)$ layer degree of freedom, we reformulate the model into a form suitable for sign-problem-free QMC simulation. From the finite-size-scaling, we show that this QMC-friendly model undergoes a quantum phase transition belonging to the 3D Ising universality class, and at the critical point we compute the scaling dimensions from the state-operator correspondence, which largely agrees with the prediction from the conformal field theory. These results pave the way to construct sign-problem-free models for QMC simulations on the fuzzy sphere, which could advance the future study on more sophisticated criticalities.</description>

      <title>Large extra dimensions from higher-dimensional inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the possibility that compact extra dimensions can obtain large size by higher dimensional inflation, relating the weakness of the actual gravitational force to the size of the observable universe. Solution to the horizon problem implies that the fundamental scale of gravity is smaller than $10^{13}$ GeV which can be realised in a braneworld framework for any number of extra dimensions. However, requirement of (approximate) flat power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations consistent with present observations makes this simple proposal possible only for one extra dimension at around the micron scale. After the end of five-dimensional inflation, the radion modulus can be stabilised at a vacuum with positive energy of the order of the present dark energy scale. An attractive possibility is based on the contribution to the Casimir energy of right-handed neutrinos with a mass at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum geodesics reflecting the internal structure of stars composed of shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, an external observer cannot distinguish distinct internal structures between two spherically symmetric stars that have the same total mass $M$. However, when quantum corrections are taken into account, the external metrics of the stars will receive quantum corrections depending on their internal structures. In this paper, we obtain the quantum-corrected metrics at linear order in curvature for two spherically symmetric shells characterized by different internal structures: one with an empty interior and the other with $N$ internal shells. The dependence on the internal structures in the corrected metrics tells us that geodesics on these backgrounds would be deformed according to the internal structures. We conduct numerical computations to find out the angle of geodesic precession and show that the presence of internal structures amplifies the precession angle reflecting the discrepancy between the radial and orbital periods within the geodesic orbit. The amount of the precession angle increases monotonically as the number of internal shells increases and it eventually converges to a certain value for $N \to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Famous work of Bridgeland and Smith shows that certain moduli spaces of quadratic differentials are isomorphic to spaces of stability conditions on particular 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated categories. This result has subsequently been generalised and extended by several authors. One facet of this correspondence is that finite-length trajectories of the quadratic differential are related to categories of semistable objects of the corresponding stability condition, which have associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. On the other hand, computations in the physics literature suggest certain values of these invariants according to the type of trajectory. In this paper, we show that the category recently constructed by Christ, Haiden, and Qiu gives Donaldson-Thomas invariants which agree with the predictions from physics; in particular, degenerate ring domains of the quadratic differential give rise to non-zero Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In calculating all of the invariants, we obtain a novel application of string and band techniques from representation theory.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Spherical Bloch Hyper-spheres from Quantum Matrix Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting analogies between the precessing quantum spin system and the charge-monopole system, we construct Bloch hyper-spheres with $\it{exact}$ spherical symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. Such Bloch hyper-spheres are realized as a collection of the orbits of a precessing quantum spin. The geometry of Bloch hyper-spheres is exactly equal to the quantum Nambu geometry of higher dimensional fuzzy spheres. The stabilizer group symmetry of the Bloch hyper-sphere necessarily introduces degenerate spin-coherent states, giving rise to the Wilczek-Zee geometric phase of non-Abelian monopoles associated with the hyper-sphere holonomy. The degenerate spin-coherent states induce matrix-valued quantum geometric tensors. While the minimal spin Bloch hyper-spheres exhibit similar properties in even and odd dimensions, their large spin counterparts differ qualitatively depending on the parity of the dimensions. Exact correspondences between spin-coherent states and monopole harmonics in higher dimensions are established. We also investigate density matrices described by Bloch hyper-balls and elucidate their corresponding statistical and geometric properties, such as von Neumann entropies and Bures quantum metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the previously-developed sub-volume method to study the $\theta$-dependence of the four-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature. We calculate the first two coefficients, the topological susceptibility $\chi$ and the fourth cumulant $b_2$, in the $\theta$-expansion of the free energy density around the critical temperature ($T_c$) for the confinement-deconfinement transition. Lattice calculations are performed with three different spatial sizes $24^3,32^3,48^3$ to monitor finite size effects, while the temporal size is fixed to be $8$. The systematic uncertainty associated with the sub-volume extrapolation is studied with special care. The sub-volume method allows us to determine the values of $b_2$ much more accurately than the standard full-volume method, and we successfully identify the temperature dependence of $b_2$ around $T_c$. Our numerical results suggest that the $\theta$-dependence of the free energy density near $\theta=0$ changes from $4\chi(1-\cos(\theta/2))$ to $\chi(1-\cos\theta)$ as the temperature crosses $T_c$.</description>

Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>
