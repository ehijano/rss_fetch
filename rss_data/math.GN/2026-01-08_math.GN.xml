      <title>Sufficient Conditions for the Shrinking Wellness Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well groups were introduced by Edelsbrunner, Morozov, and Patel to measure the robustness of geometric features of a function with respect to perturbations. Roughly speaking, the $r$-th well group measures the number of features that cannot be removed by perturbing the function by at most $r$. The Shrinking Wellness Lemma states that the rank of these groups decreases as $r$ increases. In the generality originally stated, it is wrong. We present a counterexample and give conditions under which the result holds. These conditions are general enough to cover most cases in which the well groups have been applied.</description>

      <title>On generalized Namioka spaces and joint continuity of functions on product of spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space $X$ is called "a generalized Namioka space" (g.$\mathcal{N}$-space) if for every compact space $Y$ and every separately continuous function $f\colon X\times Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, there exists at least one point $x\in X$ such that $f$ is jointly continuous at each point of $\{x\}\times Y$. We principally prove the following results: (1) $X$ is a g.$\mathcal{N}$-space, if $X$ is a non-meager open subspace of the product of a family of separable spaces or a family of pseudo-metric spaces; (2) if $Y$ is a non-meager space and $X_i$, for each $i\in I$, is a $W$-space of Grunhage with a rich family of non-meager subspaces, then $Y\times \prod_{i\in I}X_i$ is non-meager; and (3) if $X_i$, for each $i\in I$, is a non-meager space with a countable pseudo-base, then $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$ is non-meager and its tail set having the property of Baire is either meager or residual. In particular, if $G$ is a non-meager g.$\mathcal{N}$ right-topological group and $X$ a locally compact regular space, or, if $G$ is a separable first countable non-meager right-topological group and $X$ a countably compact space, then any separately continuous action $G\curvearrowright X$ is jointly continuous.</description>

      <title>On the Collatz Conjecture: Topological and Ergodic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Collatz function famously related to the Collatz Conjecture under the topological and ergodic perpectives, including an approach with thermodynamic formalism. By introducing a key topology and its Borel $\sigma$-algebra we show that recurrence implies periodicity. Moreover, we estabilsh that the set of periodic orbits is finite if, and only if, every continuous potential possesses some equilibrium state. The uniqueness of periodic orbits is equivalent to the uniqueness of equiilbrium state for every bounded and continuous potential.</description>

      <title>On semi-openness of fiber-onto extensions of minimal semiflows and quasi-separable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to finding conditions for a continuous surjection $\phi\colon X\rightarrow Y$ between compact Hausdorff spaces and its induced affine map $\phi_*\colon\mathcal{M}^1(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{M}^1(Y)$ between the regular Borel probability spaces to be semi-open. For that, we mainly prove the following by using the structure theory of extensions of semiflows and inverse limit technique:
  (1) If $\phi$ is an extension of minimal flows, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.
  (2) If $\phi$ is a quasi-separable extension of minimal semiflows with $X$ is $\phi$-fiber-onto, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.
  (3) If $Y$ is metrizable, then $\phi$ is semi-open if and only if $\phi_*$ is semi-open.
  (4) If $\phi$ is quasi almost 1-1, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.</description>
