      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting particle energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates of the maximum achievable Lorentz factor is about $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Dependence on laser intensity of the number-weighted angular distribution of Compton-scattered photon beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering of an ultra-relativistic electron in the field of a high-intensity laser produces photon beams with angular and spectral distributions that are strongly dependent on the laser intensity. Here, we show that the laser intensity at the interaction point can be accurately inferred from the measurement of the angular number-density distribution of Compton-scattered photon beams. The theory, corroborated by numerical simulations, is accurate to within 10\% in a wide range of laser intensities (dimensionless intensity $5 \leq a_0 \leq 50$) and electron energies (250 MeV $\leq E \leq $ 15 GeV), and accounts for experimental features such as the finite transverse size of the electron beam, low-energy cut-offs in the photon detector, and the possibility of a transverse misalignment between the electron beam and the laser focus.</description>

      <title>The MEMENTO code for modelling of macroscopic melt motion in fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MEMENTO (MEtallic Melt Evolution in Next-step TOkamaks) code is a new numerical implementation of the physics model originally developed for the MEMOS-U code with the objective to self-consistently describe the generation of melt and its subsequent large scale dynamics in fusion devices and to assess the damage of metallic reactor armor under powerful normal and off-normal plasma events. The model has been validated in multiple dedicated EUROfusion experiments. MEMENTO solves the heat and phase transfer problem coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the shallow water approximation for the thin liquid film over the solid metal and with the current propagation equations on a domain that features a time-evolving deforming metal-plasma interface. The code utilizes non-uniform and adaptive meshing along with sub-cycling in time facilitated by the AMReX open-source framework as well as AMReX's built-in parallelization capabilities.</description>

      <title>3D MHD modelling of plasmoid drift following massive material injection in a tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanisms of plasmoid drift following massive material injection are studied via 3D non-linear MHD modelling with the JOREK code, using a transient neutral source deposited on the low field side midplane of a JET H-mode plasma to clarify basic processes and compare with existing theory. The simulations confirm the important role of the propagation of shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) packets from both ends of the plasmoid ("SAW braking") and the development of external resistive currents along magnetic field lines ("P\'egouri\'e braking") in limiting charge separation and thus the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ plasmoid drift, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The drift velocity is found to be limited by the SAW braking in the few microseconds timescale for cases with relatively small source amplitude while the P\'egouri\'e braking is shown to set in earlier with larger toroidal extent of the source, both in good agreement with existing theory. The simulations also identify the key role of the size of the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region on plasmoid drift and show that the saturated velocity caused by dominant SAW braking agrees well with theory when considering an effective pressure within the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ flow region. The existence of SAWs in the simulations is demonstrated and the 3D picture of plasmoid drift is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Sunbeam: Near-Sun Statites as Beam Platforms for Beam-Driven Rockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (&gt;100 A.U.) advantage of relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in beam-power uses are explored.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neon-like Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity equivalent $\pm\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>
