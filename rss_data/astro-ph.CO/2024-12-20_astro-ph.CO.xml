      <title>Comments on the Union3 "Spline-Interpolated Distance Moduli" Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Union3 "Spline-Interpolated Distance Moduli" model posterior has been distributed for third-party cosmology analysis. The posterior prefers a large value of $\Omega_M$, a small absolute value of $w_0$, and a negative $w_a$, but still accommodates $\Lambda$CDM; the supernova data alone are not strongly constraining. The posterior is built assuming an underlying model and prior, both of which must be made to conform with any new model and prior being analyzed. The posterior is calculated for a prior that is not flat but rather has non-trivial structure in $\Omega_M$-$w_0$-$w_a$; the associated likelihood is slightly shifted relative to the posterior. The posterior for a prior that is flat in $\Omega_M$-$w_0$-$w_a$ is also shifted relative to the original, but not at a level that is statistically significant. The misapplication of Union3 results in the "DESI2024 VI" cosmology fits are inconsequential.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Hubble parameter from Pantheon+ data and comparison of cosmological models using cosmic chronometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with redshift $z$ is estimated from the Pantheon+ data of Type Ia supernovae, for the $\Lambda$CDM model and the three special cases of the eternal coasting (EC) cosmological model with three different spatial geometries. The scatter associated with $H(z)$ is seen to grow markedly with redshift. This behaviour, which is deduced directly from the SNe Hubble diagram, raises the question of whether the universe is undergoing a stochastic expansion, which scenario can offer an explanation for the Hubble tension in cosmology. From the estimated $H(z)$ values, the present value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ is evaluated for each of these models through regression, and the scatter using the Monte Carlo method. Bayesian comparison between these models is carried out using the data of 35 cosmic chronometers (CC). The comparative study favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, with some strong evidence. However, exclusion of four outlier CC data points with small errorbars leads to large reduction in the Bayes factor value. The unusually large value of Bayes factor obtained while using the full set of CC data raises some concerns about its tension with other data, such as that of the SNe Ia. While using the remaining 31 CC data points, it is observed that the resulting Bayes factor still favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, but with a much smaller value of the Bayes factor. When EC models are compared among themselves, the $\Omega = 2$ model has strong evidence than the $\Omega = 1$ (also known as $R_h = ct$) and the $\Omega = 0$ (Milne-type) models.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (Blinded-MDC) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the Blinded-MDC to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. The discrepancy in $H_0$ is arising due to astrophysical mis-modeling, and in the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical populations of BBHs. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Inflation without an Inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario in which scalar perturbations, that seed the large scale structure of the Universe, are generated without relying on a scalar field (the inflaton). In this framework, inflation is driven by a de Sitter space-time (dS), where tensor metric fluctuations (i.e., gravitational waves) naturally arise from quantum vacuum oscillations, and scalar fluctuations are generated via second-order tensor effects. We compute the power spectrum of such scalar fluctuations and show it to be consistent with near scale-invariance. We derive the necessary conditions under which scalar perturbations become significant and much larger than the tensor modes, and we identify a natural mechanism to end inflation via a transition to a radiation-dominated phase. Our proposed mechanism could remove the need for a model-dependent scenario: the choice of a scalar field, as the inflaton, to drive inflation.</description>

      <title>Impact of DESI BAO Data on Inflationary Parameters: stability against late-time new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I investigate the impact of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data on cosmological parameters, focusing on the inflationary spectral index $n_s$, the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$, and the matter density parameter $\omega_m$. By examining different models of late-time new physics, the inflationary parameters were revealed to be stable when compared with the baseline dataset that used the earlier BAO data from the SDSS collaboration. When combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), DESI BAO data leads to a slight reduction in $\omega_m$ (less than 2\%) and modest changes in $A_s$ and $n_s$, if compared with the same combination but using SDSS BAO data instead, suggesting a subtle shift in matter clustering. These effects may be attributed to a higher expansion rate from dynamical dark energy, changes in the recombination period, or modifications to the matter-radiation equality time. Further analyses of models with dynamical dark energy and free curvature show a consistent trend of reduced $\omega_m$, accompanied by slight increases in both $n_s$ and $H_0$. The results emphasize the importance of the DESI BAO data in refining cosmological parameter estimates and highlight the stability of inflationary parameters across different late-time cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Free streaming of warm wave dark matter in modified expansion histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In models of warm dark matter, there is an appreciable population of high momentum particles in the early universe, which free stream out of primordial over/under densities, thereby prohibiting the growth of structure on small length scales. The distance that a dark matter particle travels without obstruction, known as the free streaming length, depends on the particle's mass and momentum, but also on the cosmological expansion rate. In this way, measurements of the linear matter power spectrum serve to probe warm dark matter as well as the cosmological expansion history. In this work, we focus on ultra-light wave wave dark matter (WWDM) characterized by a typical comoving momentum $q_\ast$ and mass $m$. We first derive constraints on the WWDM parameter space $(q_\ast, m)$ using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations due to a combination of the free-streaming effect and the white-noise effect. We next assess how the free streaming of WWDM is affected by three modified expansion histories: early matter domination, early dark energy, and very early dark energy.</description>

      <title>Testing anisotropic Hubble expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological principle asserting the large-scale uniformity of the Universe is a testable assumption of the standard cosmological model. We explore the constraints on anisotropic expansion provided by measuring directional variation in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, derived from differential zeropoint measurements of the Tully-Fisher distance estimator. We fit various models for directional variation in $H_0$ using the Tully-Fisher dataset from the all-sky Cosmicflows-4 catalog. The best-fit dipole variation has an amplitude of 0.063 $\pm$ 0.016 mag in the direction ($\ell,b$) = (142 $\pm$ 30$^{\circ}$, 52 $\pm$ 10$^{\circ}$). If this were due to anisotropic expansion it would imply a 3% variation in $H_0$, corresponding to $\Delta H_0$ = 2.10 $\pm$ 0.53 km/s/Mpc if $H_0$ = 70 km/s/Mpc, with a significance of 3.9$\sigma$. A model that includes this $H_0$ dipole is only weakly favored relative to a model with a constant $H_0$ and a bulk motion of the volume sampled by Cosmicflows-4 that is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, we show that with the expected Tully-Fisher data from the WALLABY and DESI surveys it should be possible to detect a 1% $H_0$ dipole anisotropy at 5.8$\sigma$ confidence and to distinguish it from the typical bulk flow predicted by $\Lambda$CDM over the volume of these surveys.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-Point Spread Function correlations as a probe of weak-lensing systematics with UNIONS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing requires precise measurements of galaxy shapes and therefore an accurate knowledge of the PSF model. The latter can be a source of systematics that affect the shear two-point correlation function. A key stake of weak lensing analysis is to forecast the systematics due to the PSF. Correlation functions of galaxies and the PSF, the so-called $\rho$- and $\tau$-statistics, are used to evaluate the level of systematics coming from the PSF model and PSF corrections, and contributing to the two-point correlation function used to perform cosmological inference. Our goal is to introduce a fast and simple method to estimate this level of systematics and assess its agreement with state-of-the-art approaches. We introduce a new way to estimate the covariance matrix of the $\tau$-statistics using analytical expressions. The covariance allows us to estimate parameters directly related to the level of systematics associated with the PSF and provides us with a tool to validate the PSF model used in a weak-lensing analysis. We apply those methods to data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). We show that the semi-analytical covariance yields comparable results than using covariances obtained from simulations or jackknife resampling. It requires less computation time and is therefore well suited for rapid comparison of the systematic level obtained from different catalogs. We also show how one can break degeneracies between parameters with a redefinition of the $\tau$-statistics. The methods developed in this work will be useful tools in the analysis of current weak-lensing data but also of Stage IV surveys such as Euclid, LSST or Roman. They provide fast and accurate diagnostics on PSF systematics that are crucial to understand in the context of cosmic shear studies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys: The BNT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing surveys, along with most other late-Universe probes, have consistently measured a lower amplitude of the matter fluctuation spectrum, denoted by the parameter $S_8$, compared to predictions from early-Universe measurements in cosmic microwave background data. Improper modelling of nonlinear scales may partially explain these discrepancies in lensing surveys. This study investigates whether the conventional approach to addressing small-scale biases remains optimal for Stage-IV lensing surveys. We demonstrate that conventional weak lensing estimators are affected by scale leakage from theoretical biases at nonlinear scales, which influence all observed scales. Using the BNT transform, we propose an $\ell$-cut methodology that effectively controls this leakage. The BNT transform reorganizes weak lensing data in $\ell$ space, aligning it with $k$ space, thereby reducing the mixing of nonlinear scales and providing a more accurate interpretation of the data. We evaluate the BNT approach by comparing HMcode, Halofit, Baryon Correction Model and AxionHMcode mass power spectrum models using Euclid-like survey configurations. Additionally, we introduce a new estimator to quantify scale leakage in both the BNT and noBNT approaches. Our findings show that BNT outperforms traditional methods, preserving cosmological constraints while significantly mitigating theoretical biases.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and Source Redshift Distributions from Combining Radio Weak Lensing with CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of weak gravitational lensing using the cosmic microwave background and the shapes of galaxies have refined our understanding of the late-time history of the Universe. While optical surveys have been the primary source for cosmic shear measurements, radio continuum surveys offer a promising avenue. Relevant radio sources, principally star-forming galaxies, have populations with higher mean redshifts and are less affected by dust extinction compared to optical sources. We focus on the future mid frequency SKA radio telescope and explore the cross-correlation between radio cosmic shear and CMB lensing convergence ($\gamma_\mathrm{R}\times \kappa_\mathrm{CMB}$). We investigate its potential in constraining the redshift distribution of radio galaxy samples and improving cosmological parameter constraints, including the neutrino sector. Using simulations of the first phase of the SKA and the Simons Observatory as a CMB experiment, we show how this $\gamma_\mathrm{R}\times \kappa_\mathrm{CMB}$ cross-correlation can provide $\sim1 - 10\%$ calibration of the overall radio source redshift distribution, which in turn can significantly tighten otherwise degenerate measurements of radio galaxy bias. For the case of the next-generation full SKA, we find that the cross-correlation becomes more powerful than the equivalent with a \textit{Euclid}-like survey, with constraints $30\%$ tighter on $\Lambda$CDM parameters and narrower bounds on sum of neutrino masses at the level of $\sim 24\%$. These constraints are also driven by higher redshifts and larger scales than other galaxy-CMB cross-correlations, potentially shedding light on different physical models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of radio weak lensing in improving constraints, and establish the groundwork for future joint analyses of CMB experiments and radio continuum surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional calibration of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data relies on estimation of the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$ from early universe observations by assuming a cosmological model. We present a recalibration of two independent BAO datasets, SDSS and DESI, by employing deep learning techniques for model-independent estimation of $r_d$, and explore the impacts on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. Significant reductions in both Hubble ($H_0$) and clustering ($S_8$) tensions are observed for both the recalibrated datasets. Moderate shifts in some other parameters hint towards further exploration of such data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Revision of upper bound on volume-filling intergalactic magnetic fields with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields present in the Large Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe change polarization of radio waves arriving from distant extragalactic sources through the effect of Faraday rotation. This effect has been recently used to detect magnetic field in the LSS filaments based on the Rotation Measure data of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). We notice that the same data also constrain the strength of the volume-filling magnetic field in the voids of the LSS. We use the LoTSS data to to derive an improved upper bound on the volume-filling field. The new upper bound provides an order of magnitude improvement on the previous Faraday rotation bounds. The new Faraday Rotation bound on the scale-invariant field that may originate from the epoch of inflation is also an order of magnitude lower than the bound on such field derived from the anisotropy analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Tomographic analysis of galaxy angular density and redshift fluctuations in Data Release 3. Constraints on photo-$z$ errors, linear bias, and peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS) is a {\it spectro-photometric} survey covering about 3,000~deg$^2$ in its third data release (DR3), and containing about 300,000 galaxies with high quality ({\it odds}$&gt;0.8$) photometric redshifts (hereafter photo-$z$s). We use this galaxy sample to conduct a tomographic study of the counts and redshift angular fluctuations under Gaussian shells sampling the redshift range $z\in[0.05,0.25]$. We confront the angular power spectra of these observables measured under shells centered on 11 different redshifts with theoretical expectations derived from a linear Boltzmann code ({\tt ARFCAMB}). Overall we find that J-PLUS DR3 data are well reproduced by our linear, simplistic model. We obtain that counts (or density) angular fluctuations (hereafter ADF) are very sensitive to the linear galaxy bias $b_g(z)$, although weakly sensitive to radial peculiar velocities of the galaxy field, while suffering from systematics residuals for $z&gt;0.15$. Angular redshift fluctuations (ARF), instead, show higher sensitivity to radial peculiar velocities and also higher sensitivity to the average uncertainty in photo-$z$s ($\sigma_{\rm Err}$), with no obvious impact from systematics. For $z&lt;0.15$ both ADF and ARF agree on measuring a monotonically increasing linear bias varying from $b_g(z=0.05)\simeq 0.9\pm 0.06$ up to $b_g(z=0.15)\simeq 1.5\pm 0.05$, while, by first time, providing consistent measurements of $\sigma_{\rm Err}(z)\sim 0.014$ that are $\sim 40~\%$ higher than estimates from the photo-$z$ code {\tt LePhare}, ($\sigma_{\rm Err}^{\rm LePhare}=0.010$). As expected, this photo-$z$ uncertainty level prevents the detection of radial peculiar velocities in the modest volume sampled by J-PLUS DR3, although prospects for larger galaxy surveys of similar (and higher) photo-$z$ precision are promising.</description>

      <title>The J-PLUS collaboration. Additive versus multiplicative systematics in surveys of the large scale structure of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational and/or astrophysical systematics modulating the observed number of luminous tracers can constitute a major limitation in the cosmological exploitation of surveys of the large scale structure of the universe. Part of this limitation arises on top of our ignorance on how such systematics actually impact the observed galaxy/quasar fields. In this work we develop a generic, hybrid model for an arbitrary number of systematics that may modulate observations in both an additive and a multiplicative way. This model allows us devising a novel algorithm that addresses the identification and correction for either additive and/or multiplicative contaminants. We test this model on galaxy mocks and systematics templates inspired from data of the third data release of the {\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS). We find that our method clearly outperforms standard methods that assume either an additive or multiplicative character for all contaminants in scenarios where both characters are actually acting on the observed data. In simpler scenarios where only an additive or multiplicative imprint on observations is considered, our hybrid method does not lie far behind the corresponding simplified, additive/multiplicative methods. Nonetheless, in scenarios of mild/low impact of systematics, we find that our hybrid approach converges towards the standard method that assumes additive contamination, as predicted by our model describing systematics. Our methodology also allows for the estimation of biases induced by systematics residuals on different angular scales and under different observational configurations, although these predictions necessarily restrict to the subset of {\em known/identified} potential systematics, and say nothing about ``unknown unknowns" possibly impacting the data.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [43] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <title>Supernovae evidence for foundational change to cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new, cosmologically model-independent, statistical analysis of the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae spectroscopic dataset, improving a standard methodology adopted by Lane et al. We use the Tripp equation for supernova standardisation alone, thereby avoiding any potential correlation in the stretch and colour distributions. We compare the standard homogeneous cosmological model, i.e., $\Lambda$CDM, and the timescape cosmology which invokes backreaction of inhomogeneities. Timescape, while statistically homogeneous and isotropic, departs from average Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker evolution, and replaces dark energy by kinetic gravitational energy and its gradients, in explaining independent cosmological observations. When considering the entire Pantheon+ sample, we find very strong evidence ($\ln B&gt; 5$) in favour of timescape over $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, even restricting the sample to redshifts beyond any conventional scale of statistical homogeneity, $z &gt; 0.075$, timescape is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B&gt; 1$. These results provide evidence for a need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accurate method for ultralight axion CMB and matter power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight axions (ULAs) with masses $10^{-33} \lesssim m/{\rm eV} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ are well motivated in string-inspired models and can be part or all of the dark energy or the dark matter in this range. Since the ULA field oscillates at a frequency $m$ that can be much larger than the expansion rate $H$, accurate and efficient calculation of cosmological observables requires an effective time averaged treatment. While these are well established for $m\gg 10 H_{\rm eq}$, the Hubble rate at matter radiation equality, here we extend and develop these techniques to cover the mass range $10^{-33} \lesssim m/{\rm eV} \lesssim 10^{-18}$. We implement this technique in a full cosmological Boltzmann code ($\mathrm{AxiECAMB}$) with numerical precision sufficiently accurate for current and next-generation cosmic microwave background as well as large-scale structure data analysis. New effects including the time averaging of metric perturbations and hydrostatic equilibrium of the effective fluid result in many orders of magnitude improvements for power spectra accuracy over some previous treatments such as $\mathrm{AxionCAMB}$ in some extreme regions of parameter space and order unity changes of the ULA effects near $\Lambda$CDM models. These improvements may impact the model parameters that resolve various tensions in $\Lambda$CDM at a comparable level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of first-order phase transition in two-component dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10123v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we consider a classically scale-invariant extension of the Standard Model (SM) with two-component dark matter (DM) candidates, including a Dirac spinor and a scalar DM. We probe the parameter space of the model, constrained by relic density and direct detection, and investigate the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by an electroweak first-order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that there are points in the parameter space, leading to a detectable GW spectrum arising from the first-order phase transition, which is also consistent with the DM relic abundance and direct detection bounds. These GWs could be observed by forthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Big Bang Observer, Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, and Ultimate-Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory.</description>

      <title>Indirect Detection of Hot Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmologically stable, light particles that came into thermal contact with the Standard Model in the early universe may persist today as a form of hot dark matter. For relics with masses in the eV range, their role in structure formation depends critically on their mass. We trace the evolution of such hot relics and derive their density profiles around cold dark matter halos, introducing a framework for their indirect detection. Applying this framework to axions -- a natural candidate for a particle that can reach thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model in the early universe and capable of decaying into two photons -- we establish stringent limits on the axion-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma} $ using current observations of dwarf galaxies, the Milky Way halo, and galaxy clusters. Our results set new bounds on hot axions in the $\mathcal{O}(1-10)\,$eV range.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</description>

      <title>Testing a proposed "planarity" tool for studying satellite systems: On the alleged consistency of Milky Way satellite galaxy planes with $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of planes of satellite galaxies has been identified as a long-standing challenge to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, due to the rarity of satellite systems in cosmological simulations that are as extremely flattened and as strongly kinematically correlated as observed structures. Here we investigate a recently proposed new metric to measure the overall degree of ''planarity'' of a satellite system, which was used to claim consistency between the Milky Way satellite plane and $\Lambda$CDM. We study the behavior of the ''planarity'' metric under several features of anisotropy present in $\Lambda$CDM satellite systems but unrelated to satellite planes. Specifically, we consider the impact of oblate or prolate distributions, the number of satellites, clustering of satellites, and radial and asymmetric distributions ('lopsidedness'). We also investigate whether the metric is independent of the orientation of the studied satellite system. We find that all of these features of anisotropy result in the metric inferring an increased degree of ''planarity'', despite none of them having any direct relation to satellite planes. The metric is also highly sensitive to the orientation of the studied system (or chosen coordinate system): there is almost no correlation between the metric's reported degrees of ''planarity'' for identical random systems rotated by 90{\deg}. Our results demonstrate that the new proposed metric is unsuitable to measure overall ''planarity'' in satellite systems. Consequently, no consistency of the observed Milky Way satellite plane with $\Lambda$CDM can be inferred using this metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter captured in stars can act as an additional heat transport mechanism, modifying fusion rates and asteroseismoloigcal observables. Calculations of heat transport rates rely on approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equation, which have never been verified in realistic stars. Here, we simulate heat transport in the Sun, the Earth, and a brown dwarf model, using realistic radial temperature, density, composition and gravitational potential profiles. We show that the formalism developed in arXiv:2111.06895 remains accurate across all celestial objects considered, across a wide range of kinematic regimes, for both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions where scattering with multiple species becomes important. We further investigate evaporation rates of dark matter from the Sun, finding that previous calculations appear robust. Our Monte Carlo simulation software Cosmion is publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or ``tidal tracks'', of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Running Einstein Constant and the Vacuum Energy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a revised formulation of General Relativity for cosmological contexts, in which the Einstein constant varies with the energy density of the Universe. We demonstrate that this modification has no direct phenomenological impact on the Universe's dynamics or on particle motion within the expanding cosmos. Assuming a state close to vacuum, here defined by the vanishing product of the Einstein coupling constant and the Universe's energy density, we perform a Taylor expansion of the theory. In this framework, the vacuum energy problem is addressed, and an additional constant pressure term, which induces a Chaplygin-like contribution to the dark energy equation of state, arises in the late-time dynamics. The correction to the late-time Hubble parameter is investigated by comparing theoretical predictions with the late Universe observational data. Our findings indicate that the current value of the vacuum energy is consistent with zero. Alternatively, the expansion used in our formulation would no longer be valid if the current state significantly deviates from the assumed near-vacuum condition. Implications of the modified $\Lambda$CDM model with respect to the Hubble tension are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</description>

      <title>Cosmology-Independent Constraints on Irreducible Magnetic Monopole Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel mechanism for the irreducible production of magnetic monopoles from interactions of cosmic rays and interstellar medium (ISM). Resulting monopoles drain energy from galactic magnetic fields, disrupting their formation and sustainability. We generalize conventional Parker bounds to monopoles with extended energy spectrum and, considering cosmic ray ISM monopole production, set novel constraints from disruption of Milky Way Galactic magnetic fields and their seeds. Further, we set first constraints on disruption of galactic magnetic fields and their seeds of Andromeda galaxy, with results being competitive with distinct existing bounds. Unlike Parker limits of previous works that relied on cosmological monopoles, our constraints are independent of cosmological monopole production or their primordial abundance. Besides, we estimate new constraints on dipole magnetic moments generated from cosmic ray ISM interactions. We discuss implications for monopoles with generalized magnetic charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves From Dark Binaries With Finite-Range Dark Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper calculates the stochastic gravitational wave background from dark binaries with finite-range attractive dark forces, complementing previous works which consider long-range dark forces. The finiteness of the dark force range can dramatically modify both the initial distributions and evolution histories of the binaries. The generated gravitational wave spectrum is enhanced in the intermediate frequency regime and exhibits interesting "knee" and "ankle" features, the most common of which is related to the turn on of the dark force mediator radiation. Other such spectral features are related to changes in the binary merger lifetime and the probability distribution for the initial binary separation. The stochastic gravitational wave background from sub-solar-mass dark binaries is detectable by both space- and ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: The current flow of high accuracy astrophysical data, among which are the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements by the Planck satellite, offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the inflationary theory. This is however a challenging project given the size of the inflationary landscape which contains hundreds of different scenarios. Given that there is currently no observational evidence for primordial non-Gaussianities, isocurvature perturbations or any other non-minimal extension of the inflationary paradigm, a reasonable approach is to consider the simplest models first, namely the slow-roll single field models with minimal kinetic terms. This still leaves us with a very populated landscape, the exploration of which requires new and efficient strategies. It has been customary to tackle this problem by means of approximate model independent methods while a more ambitious alternative is to study the inflationary scenarios one by one. We have developed the publicly available runtime library ASPIC to implement this last approach. The ASPIC code provides all routines needed to quickly derive reheating-consistent observable predictions within this class of scenarios. ASPIC has been designed as an evolutive code which presently supports 118 different models. In this paper, for each of the ASPIC models, we present and collect new results in a systematic manner, thereby constituting the first Encyclopaedia Inflationaris.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of Betti curves in the Cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evolution of Betti curves obtained by persistent-homological analysis of point clouds formed by halos in different cosmological $N$-body simulations. We show that they can be approximated with a scaled log-normal distribution function with reasonable precision. Our analysis shows that the shapes and maximums of Betti curves exhibit dependence on the mass range of the selected subpopulation of halos. Still, at the same time, the resolution of a simulation does not play any significant role, provided that the mass distribution of simulated halos is complete down to a given mass scale. Besides, we study how Betti curves change with the evolution of the Universe, i.e., their dependence on redshift. Sampling subpopulations of halos within certain mass ranges up to redshift $z=2.5$ yields a surprisingly small difference between corresponding Betti curves. We propose that this may be an indicator of the existence of a new specific topological invariant in the structure of the Universe.</description>

      <title>On the rise and fall of galactic ionizing output at the end of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasar absorption spectra measurements suggest that reionization proceeded rapidly, ended late at $z \sim 5.5$, and was followed by a flat ionizing background evolution. Simulations that reproduce this behavior often rely on a fine tuned galaxy ionizing emissivity, which peaks at $z \sim 6-7$ and drops a factor of $1.5-2.5$ by $z \sim 5$.
  This is puzzling since the abundance of galaxies is observed to grow monotonically during this period. Explanations for this include effects such as dust obscuration of ionizing photon escape and feedback from photo-heating of the IGM. We explore the possibility that this drop in emissivity is instead an artifact of one or more modeling deficiencies in reionization simulations. These include possibly incorrect assumptions about the ionizing spectrum and/or inaccurate modeling of IGM clumping. Our results suggest that the need for a drop could be alleviated if simulations are underestimating the IGM opacity from massive, star-forming halos. Other potential modeling issues either have a small effect or require a steeper drop when remedied. We construct an illustrative model in which the emissivity is nearly flat at reionization's end, evolving only $\sim 0.05$ dex at $5 &lt; z &lt; 7$. More realistic scenarios, however, require a $\sim 0.1-0.3$ dex drop. We also study the evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ effective optical depth distribution and compare to recent measurements. We find models that feature a hard ionizing spectrum and/or are driven by faint, low-bias sources most easily reproduce the mean transmission and optical depth distribution of the forest simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dark Energy after DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurement released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models characterized by an energy-momentum flow from Dark Matter to Dark Energy. By combining Planck-2018 and DESI data, we observe a preference for interactions, leading to a non-vanishing interaction rate $\xi=-0.32^{+0.18}_{-0.14}$, which results in a present-day expansion rate $H_0=70.8^{+1.4}_{-1.7}$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the tension with the value provided by the SH0ES collaboration to less than $\sim 1.3 \sigma$. The preference for interactions remains robust when including measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ obtained from the relative ages of massive, early-time, and passively-evolving galaxies, as well as when considering distance moduli measurements from Type-Ia Supernovae sourced from the Pantheon-plus catalog using the SH0ES Cepheid host distances as calibrators. Overall, the IDE framework provides an equally good, or better, explanation of both high- and low-redshift background observations compared to $\Lambda$CDM, while also yielding higher $H_0$ values that align more closely with the local distance ladder estimates. However, a limitation of the IDE model is that it predicts lower $\Omega_{m}$ and higher $\sigma_{8}$ values, which may not be fully consistent with large-scale structure data at the perturbation level.</description>

      <title>FlexRT -- A fast and flexible cosmological radiative transfer code for reionization studies I: Code validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wealth of high-quality observational data from the epoch of reionization that will become available in the next decade motivates further development of modeling techniques for their interpretation. Among the key challenges in modeling reionization are (1) its multi-scale nature, (2) the computational demands of solving the radiative transfer (RT) equation, and (3) the large size of reionization's parameter space. In this paper, we present and validate a new RT code designed to confront these challenges. FlexRT (Flexible Radiative Transfer) combines adaptive ray tracing with a highly flexible treatment of the intergalactic ionizing opacity. This gives the user control over how the intergalactic medium (IGM) is modeled, and provides a way to reduce the computational cost of a FlexRT simulation by orders of magnitude while still accounting for small-scale IGM physics. Alternatively, the user may increase the angular and spatial resolution of the algorithm to run a more traditional reionization simulation. FlexRT has already been used in several contexts, including simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars, the redshifted 21cm signal from reionization, as well as in higher resolution reionization simulations in smaller volumes. In this work, we motivate and describe the code, and validate it against a set of standard test problems from the Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project. We find that FlexRT is in broad agreement with a number of existing RT codes in all of these tests. Lastly, we compare FlexRT to an existing adaptive ray tracing code to validate FlexRT in a cosmological reionization simulation.</description>

      <title>Towards an accurate treatment of the reduced speed of light approximation in parameterized radiative transfer simulations of reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) has been employed to speed up radiative transfer simulations of reionization by a factor of $\gtrsim 5-10$. However, it has been shown to cause significant errors in the HI-ionizing background near reionization's end in simulations of representative cosmological volumes. We show that using the RSLA is, to a good approximation, equivalent to re-scaling the global ionizing emissivity in a redshift-dependent way. We derive this re-scaling and show that it can be used to ``correct'' the emissivity in RSLA simulations. This method requires the emissivity to be re-scaled after the simulation has been run, which limits its applicability to situations where the emissivity is set ``by hand'' or determined by free parameters. We test our method by running full speed of light simulations using these re-scaled emissivities and comparing them with their RSLA counterparts. We find that for reduced speeds of light $\tilde{c} \geq 0.2$, the 21 cm power spectrum at $0.1 \leq k /[h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}] \leq 0.2$ and key Ly$\alpha$ forest observables agree to within $20\%$, and often within $10\%$, throughout reionization. Position-dependent time-delay effects cause inaccuracies in reionization's morphology on large scales at the factor of $2$ level for $\tilde{c} \leq 0.1$. Our method allows for up to a factor of $5$ speedup in studies that express the emissivity in terms of free parameters, including efforts to constrain the emissivity using observations. This is a crucial step towards constraining the ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies using efficient radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a neural network emulator to constrain the thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $\displaystyle{5.4}\le{z}\le{6.0}$ using the Lyman-$\displaystyle\alpha$ (Ly$\displaystyle\alpha$) forest flux auto-correlation function. Our auto-differentiable JAX-based framework accelerates the surrogate model generation process using approximately 100 sparsely sampled Nyx hydrodynamical simulations with varying combinations of thermal parameters, i.e., the temperature at mean density $\displaystyle{T}_{{0}}$, the slope of the temperature$\displaystyle-$density relation $\displaystyle\gamma$, and the mean transmission flux $\displaystyle{\langle}{F}{\rangle}$. We show that this emulator has a typical accuracy of 1.0% across the specified redshift range. Bayesian inference of the IGM thermal parameters, incorporating emulator uncertainty propagation, is further expedited using NumPyro Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We compare both the inference results and computational cost of our framework with the traditional nearest-neighbor interpolation approach applied to the same set of mock Ly$\alpha$ flux. By examining the credibility contours of the marginalized posteriors for $\displaystyle{T}_{{0}},\gamma,\text{and}{\langle}{F}{\rangle}$ obtained using the emulator, the statistical reliability of measurements is established through inference on 100 realistic mock data sets of the auto-correlation function.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.</description>

Abstract: We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from $z=0$ -- $10$. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function. We calibrate the baryonic prescriptions using a fully Bayesian approach in order to reproduce observed population statistics. The obtained parametrizations are then used to study the relation between galaxy and black hole properties, as well as their evolution with redshift. The galaxy stellar mass -- UV luminosity relation, black hole mass -- stellar mass relation, black hole mass -- AGN luminosity relation, and redshift evolution of these quantities obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with observations. Based on these results, we present upper limits on the expected number of sources for $z=5$ up to $z=15$ for scheduled JWST and \textit{Euclid} surveys, thus showcasing that empirical models can offer qualitative as well as quantitative prediction in a fast, easy and flexible manner that complements more computationally expensive approaches.</description>

      <title>Information divergences to parametrize astrophysical uncertainties in dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04959</link>

Abstract: Astrophysical uncertainties in dark matter direct detection experiments are typically addressed by parametrizing the velocity distribution in terms of a few uncertain parameters that vary around some central values. Here we propose a method to optimize over all velocity distributions lying within a given distance measure from a central distribution. We discretize the dark matter velocity distribution as a superposition of streams, and use a variety of information divergences to parametrize its uncertainties. With this, we bracket the limits on the dark matter-nucleon and dark matter-electron scattering cross sections, when the true dark matter velocity distribution deviates from the commonly assumed Maxwell-Boltzmann form. The methodology pursued is general and could be applied to other physics scenarios where a given physical observable depends on a function that is uncertain.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>

Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing a homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for this purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Warp Drives, and Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Dark Galactic subhalos and the Gaia snail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.</description>
