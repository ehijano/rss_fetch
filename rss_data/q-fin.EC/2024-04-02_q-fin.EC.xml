      <title>Multicriteria Analysis Model in Sustainable Corn Farming Area Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a framework for multicriteria analysis to evaluate alternatives for sustainable corn agricultural area planning, considering the integration of ecological, economic, and social aspects as pillars of sustainability. The research method uses qualitative and quantitative approaches to integrate ecological, economic, and social aspects in the multicriteria analysis. The analysis involves land evaluation, subcriteria identification, and data integration using Multidimensional Scaling and Analytical Hierarchy Process methods to prioritize developing sustainable corn agricultural areas. Based on the results of the RAP-Corn analysis, it indicates that the ecological dimension depicts less sustainability. The AHP results yield weight distribution and highly relevant scores that describe tangible preferences. Priority directions are grouped as strategic steps toward achieving the goals of sustainable corn agricultural area planning.</description>

      <title>Methods of Stochastic Field Theory in Non-Equilibrium Systems -- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a couple of investigations related to symmetry breaking phenomena, 'spontaneous stochasticity' and 'ergodicity breaking' have led to significant impacts in a variety of fields related to the stochastic processes such as economics and finance. We investigate on the origins and effects of those original symmetries in the action from the mathematical and the effective field theory points of view. It is naturally expected that whenever the system respects any symmetry, it would be spontaneously broken once the system falls into a vacuum state which minimizes an effective action of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Expansion under Taxes and Subsidies: A Transmission Operator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of a transmission system operator within a carbon footprint reduction strategy incorporating carbon taxes and renewable energy generation subsidies in the decentralised energy market. This is achieved via an optimisation bi-level model in which a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator makes investments in transmission lines at the upper level while considering power market dynamics at the lower level. To account for the deregulated energy market structure, this paper assumes that the generation companies at the lower level make capacity investments as price-takers in perfect competition. Considering alternative transmission infrastructure expansion budgets, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives for renewable energy generation capacity expansion, the impact of alternative compositions of these factors is analysed against three output factors: the share of renewable energy in the generation mix, total generation amount, and social welfare. The proposed modelling assessment is applied to an illustrative three-node instance and a case study considering a simplified representation of the energy system of the Nordic and Baltic countries. The results highlight that, under certain circumstances, renewable energy generation subsidies may lead to an increase of renewable energy in the generation mix followed by a simultaneous fall in the total generation amount. Nevertheless, when applied together, these three measures demonstrated a positive impact on all output factors within Nordics' and Baltics' energy systems. The experiments additionally suggest that considering the high value of the carbon tax does not have an impact on the output factors while the composition of high values of renewable energy generation subsidies and budget for transmission infrastructure expansion has the strongest effect.</description>
