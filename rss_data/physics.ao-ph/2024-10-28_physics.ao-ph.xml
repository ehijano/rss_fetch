      <title>Assessment of Abrupt Shifts in CMIP6 Models using Edge Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research over the past decade has shown that multiple elements of the climate system, such as the Arctic Winter sea ice or the Amazon rainforest, could undergo abrupt shifts, but there are large uncertainties regarding their timing and spatial extent. In this study we investigated when and where abrupt shifts occur in the latest generation of climate models (CMIP6) under a scenario of a 1% annual increase in CO$_2$. We considered 82 ocean, atmosphere, and land variables across 57 models. We used a Canny edge detection method -- adapted for spatiotemporal dimensions -- to detect abrupt shifts occurring on time scales from years to decades. Then, we performed a connected component analysis to quantify the spatial extent of these shifts. The systems analyzed include the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan Plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic sea ice, monsoon systems, Arctic summer sea ice, Arctic winter sea ice, and Barents sea ice. With the exception of the monsoons systems, we found abrupt shifts in multiple models per system. We observed a considerable variation across the different CMIP6 models in terms of timing and spatial extent. Higher levels of global warming increased the risk of abrupt shifts in CMIP6 models. Even at a global warming level of 1.5 $^\circ \text{C}$, six out of ten studied climate subsystems showed abrupt shifts that cover a substantial area in multiple models.</description>

      <title>Self-Shielding Enhanced Organics Synthesis in an Early Reduced Earth's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth is expected to have acquired a reduced proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4 through the accretion of building blocks that contain metallic Fe and/or the gravitational trapping of surrounding nebula gas. Such an early, wet, reduced atmosphere that covers a proto-ocean would then ultimately evolve toward oxidized chemical compositions through photochemical processes that involve reactions with H2O-derived oxidant radicals and the selective escape of hydrogen to space. During this time, atmospheric CH4 could be photochemically reprocessed to generate not only C-bearing oxides but also organics. However, the branching ratio between organic matter formation and oxidation remains unknown despite its significance on the abiotic chemical evolution of early Earth. Here, we show via numerical analyses that UV absorptions by gaseous hydrocarbons such as C2H2 and C3H4 significantly suppress H2O photolysis subsequent CH4 oxidation during the photochemical evolution of a wet proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4. As a result, nearly half of the initial CH4 converted to heavier organics along with the deposition of prebiotically essential molecules such as HCN and H2CO on the surface of a primordial ocean for a geological timescale order of 10-100 Myr. Our results suggest that the accumulation of organics and prebiotically important molecules in the proto-ocean could produce a soup enriched in various organics, which might have eventually led to the emergence of living organisms.</description>

      <title>Turbine location-aware multi-decadal wind power predictions for Germany using CMIP6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change will impact wind and therefore wind power generation with largely unknown effect and magnitude. Climate models can provide insights and should be used for long-term power planning. In this work we use Gaussian processes to predict power output given wind speeds from a global climate model and compare the aggregated predictions to actual power generation. Analyzing past climate model data supports the use of CMIP6 climate model data for multi-decadal wind power predictions and highlights the importance of being location-aware. Our predictions up to 2050 reveal only minor changes in yearly wind power generation. We find that wind power projections of the two in-between climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 closely align with actual wind power generation between 2015 and 2023. Our analysis also reveals larger uncertainty associated with Germany's coastal areas in the North as compared to Germany's South, motivating wind power expansion in regions where future wind is likely more reliable. Overall, our results indicate that wind energy will likely remain a reliable energy source in the future.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>
