      <title>The thermodynamics of pressure activated assembly of supramolecules in isochoric and isobaric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of cryopreservation is constrained by the difficulty of achieving sufficiently high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes without inducing osmotic injury or chemical toxicity during loading. This thermodynamic study introduces a new conceptual mechanism for cryoprotectant delivery into cells directly or through vascular perfusion. In this framework, effective cryoprotection could be achieved through the in situ generation of high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes via pressure-activated disassembly of membrane-permeant supramolecular assemblies composed of cryoprotectant monomers or oligomers. These supramolecules, present initially at low concentrations, are envisioned to enter cells through passive partitioning or endocytosis with minimal osmotic effect, and subsequently transform into a high intracellular concentration of cryoprotectants upon disassembly. We propose that elevated hydrostatic pressure, generated intrinsically during isochoric (constant-volume) freezing or applied externally under isobaric (constant-pressure) conditions, can destabilize supramolecular assemblies whose dissociated state occupies a smaller molar volume than the assembled state. Under isochoric freezing, ice formation within a fixed volume produces a substantial pressure increase as a thermodynamic consequence of phase change, rendering pressure a dependent variable governed by the Helmholtz free energy. Under isobaric conditions, pressure acts as an externally controlled variable through the Gibbs free energy. In both formulations, pressure-activated disassembly decouples membrane transport from cryoprotectant availability and enables synchronized solute generation precisely during cooling or freezing, without pre-loading of osmotically active solutes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the uncertainty of molecular dynamics simulations : Good-Turing statistics revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously shown that Good-Turing statistics can be applied to molecular dynamics trajectories to estimate the probability of observing completely new (thus far unobserved) biomolecular structures, and showed that the method is stable, dependable and its predictions verifiable. The major problem with that initial algorithm was the requirement for calculating and storing in memory the two-dimensional RMSD matrix of the currently available trajectory. This requirement precluded the application of the method to very long simulations. Here we describe a new variant of the Good-Turing algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the number of structures in the trajectory, making it suitable even for extremely long simulations. We show that the new method gives essentially identical results with the older implementation, and present results obtained from trajectories containing up to 22 million structures. A computer program implementing the new algorithm is available from standard repositories.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary and Structural Constraints Define a Mutation-Resistant Catalytic Core in E. coli Serine Hydroxy methyltransferase (SHMT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase is an essential enzyme in the Escherichia coli folate pathway, yet it has not been adopted as an antibacterial target, unlike DHFR, DHPS, or thymidylate synthase. To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected. This makes SHMT an underexplored yet promising target for the rational design of next-generation antibacterial agents.</description>
