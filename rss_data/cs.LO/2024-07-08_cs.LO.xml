      <title>Comparing Differentiable Logics for Learning with Logical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research on formal verification of machine learning systems indicates that learning from data alone often fails to capture underlying background knowledge such as specifications implicitly available in the data. Various neural network verifiers have been developed to ensure that a machine-learnt model satisfies correctness and safety properties, however, they typically assume a trained network with fixed weights. A promising approach for creating machine learning models that inherently satisfy constraints after training is to encode background knowledge as explicit logical constraints that guide the learning process via so-called differentiable logics. In this paper, we experimentally compare and evaluate various logics from the literature, presenting our findings and highlighting open problems for future work.</description>

      <title>Ultraproducts in abstract categorical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous publication, we introduced an abstract logic via an abstract notion of quantifier. Drawing upon concepts from categorical logic, this abstract logic interprets formulas from context as subobjects in a specific category, e.g., Cartesian, regular, or coherent categories, Grothendieck, or elementary toposes. We proposed an entailment system formulated as a sequent calculus which we proved complete. Building on this foundation, our current work explores model theory within abstract logic. More precisely, we generalize one of the most important and powerful classical model theory methods, namely the ultraproduct method, and show its fundamental theorem, i.e., Los's theorem. The result is shown as independently as possible of a given quantifier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial sets generalize many categories of graphs. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the Lawvere-Tierney topologies on (semi-)simplicial sets, on bicolored graphs, and on fuzzy sets. We apply our results to establish that 'partially simple' simplicial sets and 'partially simple' graphs form quasitoposes.</description>

      <title>Weighted basic parallel processes and combinatorial enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study weighted basic parallel processes (WBPP), a nonlinear recursive generalisation of weighted finite automata inspired from process algebra and Petri net theory. Our main result is an algorithm of 2-EXPSPACE complexity for the WBPP equivalence problem. While (unweighted) BPP language equivalence is undecidable, we can use this algorithm to decide multiplicity equivalence of BPP and language equivalence of unambiguous BPP, with the same complexity. These are long-standing open problems for the related model of weighted context-free grammars. Our second contribution is a connection between WBPP, power series solutions of systems of polynomial differential equations, and combinatorial enumeration. To this end we consider constructible differentially finite power series (CDF), a class of multivariate differentially algebraic series introduced by Bergeron and Reutenauer in order to provide a combinatorial interpretation to differential equations. CDF series generalise rational, algebraic, and a large class of D-finite (holonomic) series, for which decidability of equivalence was an open problem. We show that CDF series correspond to commutative WBPP series. As a consequence of our result on WBPP and commutativity, we show that equivalence of CDF power series can be decided with 2-EXPTIME complexity. The complexity analysis is based on effective bounds from algebraic geometry, namely on the length of chains of polynomial ideals constructed by repeated application of finitely many, not necessarily commuting derivations of a multivariate polynomial ring. This is obtained by generalising a result of Novikov and Yakovenko in the case of a single derivation, which is noteworthy since generic bounds on ideal chains are non-primitive recursive in general. On the way, we develop the theory of \WBPP~series and \CDF~power series, exposing several of their appealing properties.</description>

      <title>Verifying Peephole Rewriting In SSA Compiler IRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing need for domain-specific reasoning in modern compilers. This has fueled the use of tailored intermediate representations (IRs) based on static single assignment (SSA), like in the MLIR compiler framework. Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) provide strong guarantees for the end-to-end verification of compilers (e.g., CompCert). However, modern compilers and their IRs evolve at a rate that makes proof engineering alongside them prohibitively expensive. Nevertheless, well-scoped push-button automated verification tools such as the Alive peephole verifier for LLVM-IR gained recognition in domains where SMT solvers offer efficient (semi) decision procedures. In this paper, we aim to combine the convenience of automation with the versatility of ITPs for verifying peephole rewrites across domain-specific IRs. We formalize a core calculus for SSA-based IRs that is generic over the IR and covers so-called regions (nested scoping used by many domain-specific IRs in the MLIR ecosystem). Our mechanization in the Lean proof assistant provides a user-friendly frontend for translating MLIR syntax into our calculus. We provide scaffolding for defining and verifying peephole rewrites, offering tactics to eliminate the abstraction overhead of our SSA calculus. We prove correctness theorems about peephole rewriting, as well as two classical program transformations. To evaluate our framework, we consider three use cases from the MLIR ecosystem that cover different levels of abstractions: (1) bitvector rewrites from LLVM, (2) structured control flow, and (3) fully homomorphic encryption. We envision that our mechanization provides a foundation for formally verified rewrites on new domain-specific IRs.</description>

      <title>Specification and Automatic Verification of Computational Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the following validation problem for computational reductions: for algorithmic problems $P$ and $P^\star$, is a given candidate reduction indeed a reduction from $P$ to $P^\star$? Unsurprisingly, this problem is undecidable even for very restricted classes of reductions. This leads to the question: Is there a natural, expressive class of reductions for which the validation problem can be attacked algorithmically? We answer this question positively by introducing an easy-to-use graphical specification mechanism for computational reductions, called cookbook reductions. We show that cookbook reductions are sufficiently expressive to cover many classical graph reductions and expressive enough so that SAT remains NP-complete (in the presence of a linear order). Surprisingly, the validation problem is decidable for natural and expressive subclasses of cookbook reductions.</description>

      <title>Simple grammar bisimilarity, with an application to session type equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an algorithm for deciding simple grammar bisimilarity whose complexity is polynomial in the valuation of the grammar (maximum seminorm among production rules). Since the valuation is at most exponential in the size of the grammar, this gives rise to a single-exponential running time. Previously only a doubly-exponential algorithm was known. As an application, we provide a conversion from context-free session types to simple grammars whose valuation is linear in the size of the type. In this way, we provide the first polynomial-time algorithm for deciding context-free session type equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.10914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of "quantum references", similar to lenses in classical functional programming, that allow to point to a subsystem of a larger quantum system, and to mutate/measure that part. Mutable classical variables, quantum registers, and wires in quantum circuits are examples of this, but also references to parts of larger quantum datastructures. Quantum references in our setting can also refer to subparts of other references, or combinations of parts from different references, or quantum references seen in a different basis, etc. Our modeling is intended to be well suited for formalization in theorem provers and as a foundation for modeling variables in quantum programs. We study quantum references in greater detail and cover the infinite-dimensional case as well, but also provide a more general treatment not specific to the quantum case. We implemented a large part of our results (including a small quantum Hoare logic and an analysis of quantum teleportation) in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Session-Based Concurrency: Deadlock-freedom in Cyclic Process Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13091v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of ensuring the deadlock-freedom property for message-passing processes that communicate asynchronously in cyclic process networks. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present Asynchronous Priority-based Classical Processes (APCP), a session-typed process framework that supports asynchronous communication, delegation, and recursion in cyclic process networks. Building upon the Curry-Howard correspondences between linear logic and session types, we establish essential meta-theoretical results for APCP, most notably deadlock freedom. Second, we present a new concurrent $\lambda$-calculus with asynchronous session types, dubbed LASTn. We illustrate LASTn by example and establish its meta-theoretical results; in particular, we show how to soundly transfer the deadlock-freedom guarantee from APCP. To this end, we develop a translation of terms in LASTn into processes in APCP that satisfies a strong formulation of operational correspondence.</description>

Abstract: An infinite set is orbit-finite if, up to permutations of the underlying structure of atoms, it has only finitely many elements. We study a generalisation of linear programming where constraints are expressed by an orbit-finite system of linear inequalities. As our principal contribution we provide a decision procedure for checking if such a system has a real solution, and for computing the minimal/maximal value of a linear objective function over the solution set. We also show undecidability of these problems in case when only integer solutions are considered. Therefore orbit-finite linear programming is decidable, while orbit-finite integer linear programming is not.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalisation of the theory of quantitative algebras of Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin where (i) the carriers of quantitative algebras are not restricted to be metric spaces and can be arbitrary fuzzy relations or generalised metric spaces, and (ii) the interpretations of the algebraic operations are not required to be nonexpansive. Our main results include: a novel sound and complete proof system, the proof that free quantitative algebras always exist, the proof of strict monadicity of the induced Free-Forgetful adjunction, the result that all monads (on fuzzy relations) that lift finitary monads (on sets) admit a quantitative equational presentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equivalence relation can be constructed from a given (homogeneous, binary) relation in two steps: first, construct the smallest reflexive and transitive relation containing the given relation (the "star" of the relation) and, second, construct the largest symmetric relation that is included in the result of the first step. The fact that the final result is also reflexive and transitive (as well as symmetric), and thus an equivalence relation, is not immediately obvious, although straightforward to prove. Rather than prove that the defining properties of reflexivity and transitivity are satisfied, we establish reflexivity and transitivity \emph{constructively} by exhibiting a particular starth root -- in a way that emphasises the creative process in its construction. The constructed starth root is fundamental to algorithms that determinethe strongly connected components of a graph as well as the decomposition of a graph into its strongly connected components together with an acyclic graph connecting such components.</description>

We also report on the formalisation of cubical $\omega$-categories with the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, which has been instrumental in developing the single-set axiomatisation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Graphical Quadratic Algebra (GQA), a string diagrammatic calculus extending the language of Graphical Affine Algebra with a new generator characterised by invariance under rotation matrices. We show that GQA is a sound and complete axiomatisation for three different models: quadratic relations, which are a compositional formalism for least-squares problems, Gaussian stochastic processes, and Gaussian stochastic processes extended with non-determinisms. The equational theory of GQA sheds light on the connections between these perspectives, giving an algebraic interpretation to the interplay of stochastic behaviour, relational behaviour, non-determinism, and conditioning. As applications, we discuss various case studies, including linear regression, probabilistic programming, and electrical circuits with realistic (noisy) components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For performance and verification in machine learning, new methods have recently been proposed that optimise learning systems to satisfy formally expressed logical properties. Among these methods, differentiable logics (DLs) are used to translate propositional or first-order formulae into loss functions deployed for optimisation in machine learning. At the same time, recent attempts to give programming language support for verification of neural networks showed that DLs can be used to compile verification properties to machine-learning backends. This situation is calling for stronger guarantees about the soundness of such compilers, the soundness and compositionality of DLs, and the differentiability and performance of the resulting loss functions. In this paper, we propose an approach to formalise existing DLs using the Mathematical Components library in the Coq proof assistant. Thanks to this formalisation, we are able to give uniform semantics to otherwise disparate DLs, give formal proofs to existing informal arguments, find errors in previous work, and provide formal proofs to missing conjectured properties. This work is meant as a stepping stone for the development of programming language support for verification of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Equational Theories and Validity for Logically Constrained Term Rewriting (Full Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logically constrained term rewriting is a relatively new formalism where rules are equipped with constraints over some arbitrary theory. Although there are many recent advances with respect to rewriting induction, completion, complexity analysis and confluence analysis for logically constrained term rewriting, these works solely focus on the syntactic side of the formalism lacking detailed investigations on semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semantic side of logically constrained term rewriting. To this end, we first define constrained equations, constrained equational theories and validity of the former based on the latter. After presenting the relationship of validity and conversion of rewriting, we then construct a sound inference system to prove validity of constrained equations in constrained equational theories. Finally, we give an algebraic semantics, which enables one to establish invalidity of constrained equations in constrained equational theories. This algebraic semantics derive a new notion of consistency for constrained equational theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study networks of processes that all execute the same finite state protocol and that communicate through broadcasts. The processes are organized in a graph (a topology) and only the neighbors of a process in this graph can receive its broadcasts. The coverability problem asks, given a protocol and a state of the protocol, whether there is a topology for the processes such that one of them (at least) reaches the given state. This problem is undecidable. We study here an under-approximation of the problem where processes alternate a bounded number of times $k$ between phases of broadcasting and phases of receiving messages. We show that, if the problem remains undecidable when $k$ is greater than 6, it becomes decidable for $k=2$, and EXPSPACE-complete for $k=1$. Furthermore, we show that if we restrict ourselves to line topologies, the problem is in $P$ for $k=1$ and $k=2$.</description>

      <title>LOGIC-LM++: Multi-Step Refinement for Symbolic Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks. Although recent works have started to employ formal languages as an intermediate representation for reasoning tasks, they often face challenges in accurately generating and refining these formal specifications to ensure correctness. To address these issues, this paper proposes Logic-LM++, an improvement on Logic-LM . It uses the ability of LLMs to do pairwise comparisons, allowing the evaluation of the refinements suggested by the LLM. The paper demonstrates that Logic-LM++ outperforms Logic-LM and other contemporary techniques across natural language reasoning tasks on three datasets, FOLIO, ProofWriter and AR-LSAT, with an average improvement of 18.5% on standard prompting, 12.3% on chain of thought prompting and 5% on Logic-LM.</description>

      <title>A Syntax for Strictly Associative and Unital $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first definition of strictly associative and unital $\infty$-category. Our proposal takes the form of a type theory whose terms describe the operations of such structures, and whose definitional equality relation enforces desired strictness conditions. The key technical device is a new computation rule in the definitional equality of the theory, which we call insertion, defined in terms of a universal property. On terms for which it is defined, this operation "inserts" one of the arguments of a substituted coherence into the coherence itself, appropriately modifying the pasting diagram and result type, and simplifying the syntax in the process. We generate an equational theory from this reduction relation and we study its properties in detail, showing that it yields a decision procedure for equality.
  Expressed as a type theory, our model is well-adapted for generating and verifying efficient proofs of higher categorical statements. We illustrate this via an OCaml implementation, and give a number of examples, including a short encoding of the syllepsis, a 5-dimensional homotopy that plays an important role in the homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of a growing body of research in AI and cognitive science. In this paper, we probe the extent to which twenty-five LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king'). These inferences have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they play a central role in the fundamental human ability to reason about distal possibilities. Assessing LLMs on these inferences is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. Among the LLMs we tested, all but the GPT-4 model family often make basic mistakes with conditionals, though zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting helps them make fewer mistakes. Moreover, even the GPT-4 family displays logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals, and almost all models give answers to certain complex conditional inferences widely discussed in the literature that do not match human judgments. These results highlight gaps in basic logical reasoning in today's LLMs.</description>

      <title>VITAMIN: A Compositional Framework for Model Checking of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The verification of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) poses a significant challenge. Various approaches and methodologies exist to address this challenge; however, tools that support them are not always readily available. Even when such tools are accessible, they tend to be hard-coded, lacking in compositionality, and challenging to use due to a steep learning curve. In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed for the formal verification of MAS in a modular and versatile manner, along with an initial prototype, that we named VITAMIN. Unlike existing verification methodologies and frameworks for MAS, VITAMIN is constructed for easy extension to accommodate various logics (for specifying the properties to verify) and models (for determining on what to verify such properties).</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces.
  We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>
