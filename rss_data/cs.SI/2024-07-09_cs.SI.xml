      <title>On the Relation between Graph Ricci Curvature and Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between curvature and topology is a very well-studied theme in the subject of differential geometry. By suitably defining curvature on networks, the study of this theme has been extended into the domain of network analysis as well. In particular, this has led to curvature-based community detection algorithms. In this paper, we reveal the relation between community structure of a network and the curvature of its edges. In particular, we give apriori bounds on the curvature of intercommunity edges of a graph.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Personalized PageRank for temporal networks: discrete and continuous scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the PageRank of temporal networks on both discrete and continuous time scales in the presence of personalization vectors that vary over time. Also the underlying interplay between the discrete and continuous settings arising from discretization is highlighted. Additionally, localization results that set bounds to the estimated influence of the personalization vector on the ranking of a particular node are given. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of some real and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Chronological Analysis of Rigvedic Mandalas using Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing the chronology of the Vedas has interested scholars for the last two centuries. The oldest among them is Rig-Veda which has ten Mandalas, each composed separately. In this paper, we look at deciphering plausible pointers to the internal chronology of the Mandalas, by focusing on Gods and Goddesses worshiped in different Mandalas. We apply text analysis to the Mandalas using Clustering Techniques based on Cosine Similarity. Then we represent the association of deities with Mandalas using a grid-based Social Network that is amenable to chronological analysis and demonstrates the benefits of using Social Network Analysis for the problem at hand. Further, we analyze references to rivers to arrive at additional correlations. The approach used can be deployed generically to analyze other kinds of references and mentions and arrive at more substantive inferences.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Attack for Centrality Disruption in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many mobile networks are represented as graphs to obtain insight to their connectivity and transmission properties. Among these properties centrality resilience, that is, how well centralities, such as closeness and betweennesss, are maintained under attacks is a critical factor for proper functioning of a network. In this paper, we study the centrality resilience of complex networks by developing attack models to disrupt the rank of the top path-based centrality vertices. To develop our attack models, we extend the concept of rich clubs of influential vertices to the more general framework of scattered rich clubs. We define scattered rich clubs as dense subgraphs of high centrality vertices that are spread (scattered) across the network. Finding scattered rich clubs, although of polynomial time complexity, is extremely expensive computationally. We use snowball sampling to identify these important substructures as well as to identify which edges to target in our proposed attack models. Our results over a set of real world networks demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is effective in finding the single or scattered rich clubs efficiently and in successfully disrupting the centrality rankings of the network. To summarize, we propose sampling-based attack models for testing the resilience of networks with respect to centrality rankings. As part of this process, we introduce scattered rich clubs, a generalized form of the rich club model, efficient algorithms to detect them, and demonstrate their relation to network resilience.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes current research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to highlight the reasons for the dissent in echo chamber research on the existence, antecedents, and effects of the phenomenon. The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.
  Most of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.</description>

      <title>Changepoint Detection in Highly-Attributed Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous behavior in dynamic networks remains a constant challenge. This problem is further exacerbated when the underlying topology of these networks is affected by individual highly-dimensional node attributes. We address this issue by tracking a network's modularity as a proxy of its community structure. We leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate each snapshot's modularity. GNNs can account for both network structure and high-dimensional node attributes, providing a comprehensive approach for estimating network statistics. Our method is validated through simulations that demonstrate its ability to detect changes in highly-attributed networks by analyzing shifts in modularity. Moreover, we find our method is able to detect a real-world event within the \#Iran Twitter reply network, where each node has high-dimensional textual attributes.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sentiment Discrepancy for Multimodal Sentiment Detection via Semantics Completion and Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of social media posts in recent years, the need to detect sentiments in multimodal (image-text) content has grown rapidly. Since posts are user-generated, the image and text from the same post can express different or even contradictory sentiments, leading to potential \textbf{sentiment discrepancy}. However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performances. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the OCR text embedded in the image, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal sentiment datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoDe against SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>The temporal dynamics of group interactions in higher-order social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing social systems as networks, starting from the interactions between individuals, sheds light on the mechanisms governing their dynamics. However, networks encode only pairwise interactions, while most social interactions occur among groups of individuals, requiring higher-order network representations. Despite the recent interest in higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of groups, and how people move between groups. Here, we leverage empirical data on social interactions among children and university students to study their temporal dynamics at both individual and group levels, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate. We find robust patterns across contexts and propose a dynamical model that closely reproduces empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding social systems, and open up research directions to study the impact of group dynamics on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them.</description>

      <title>Problem-Solving in Language Model Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), several multi-agent approaches have been introduced. While these methods enhance performance, the application of collective intelligence-based approaches to complex network structures and the dynamics of agent interactions remain underexplored. This work extends the concept of multi-agent debate to more general network topologies, measuring the question-answering accuracy, influence, consensus, and the effects of bias on the collective. The results show that random networks perform similarly to fully connected networks despite using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, a strong consensus among agents correlates with correct answers, whereas divided responses typically indicate incorrect answers. Analysing the influence of the agents reveals a balance between self-reflection and interconnectedness; self-reflection aids when local interactions are incorrect, and local interactions aid when the agent itself is incorrect. Additionally, bias plays a strong role in system performance with correctly biased hub nodes boosting performance. These insights suggest that using random networks or scale-free networks with knowledgeable agents placed in central positions can enhance the overall question-answering performance of multi-agent systems.</description>
