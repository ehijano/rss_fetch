      <title>An extension of C++ with memory-centric specifications for HPC to reduce memory footprints and streamline MPI development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C++ programming language and its cousins lean towards a memory-inefficient storage of structs: The compiler inserts helper bits into the struct such that individual attributes align with bytes, and it adds additional bytes aligning attributes with cache lines, while it is not able to exploit knowledge about the range of integers, enums or bitsets to bring the memory footprint down. Furthermore, the language provides neither support for data exchange via MPI nor for arbitrary floating-point precision formats. If developers need to have a low memory footprint and MPI datatypes over structs which exchange only minimal data, they have to manipulate the data and to write MPI datatypes manually. We propose a C++ language extension based upon C++ attributes through which developers can guide the compiler what memory arrangements would be beneficial: Can multiple booleans be squeezed into one bit field, do floats hold fewer significant bits than in the IEEE standard, or does the code require a user-defined MPI datatype for certain subsets of attributes? The extension offers the opportunity to fall back to normal alignment and padding rules via plain C++ assignments, no dependencies upon external libraries are introduced, and the resulting code remains standard C++. Our work implements the language annotations within LLVM and demonstrates their potential impact, both upon the runtime and the memory footprint, through smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) benchmarks. They uncover the potential gains in terms of performance and development productivity.</description>

      <title>Flexible Multi-Dimensional FFTs for Plane Wave Density Functional Theory Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-dimensional Fourier transforms are key mathematical building blocks that appear in a wide range of applications from materials science, physics, chemistry and even machine learning. Over the past years, a multitude of software packages targeting distributed multi-dimensional Fourier transforms have been developed. Most variants attempt to offer efficient implementations for single transforms applied on data mapped onto rectangular grids. However, not all scientific applications conform to this pattern, i.e. plane wave Density Functional Theory codes require multi-dimensional Fourier transforms applied on data represented as batches of spheres. Typically, the implementations for this use case are hand-coded and tailored for the requirements of each application. In this work, we present the Fastest Fourier Transform from Berkeley (FFTB) a distributed framework that offers flexible implementations for both regular/non-regular data grids and batched/non-batched transforms. We provide a flexible implementations with a user-friendly API that captures most of the use cases. Furthermore, we provide implementations for both CPU and GPU platforms, showing that our approach offers improved execution time and scalability on the HP Cray EX supercomputer. In addition, we outline the need for flexible implementations for different use cases of the software package.</description>
