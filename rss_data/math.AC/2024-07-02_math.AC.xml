      <title>Minimal Free Resolutions of Edge Ideals of Edge-Weighted Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly describe cellular minimal free resolutions of certain classes of edge ideals of weighted complete bipartite graphs based on a construction of Visscher. Specifically, we show that Visscher's construction minimally resolves all edge ideals of undirected vertex-weighted complete bipartite graphs, and we characterize the edge-weighted complete bipartite graphs whose edge ideals are minimally resolved by Visscher's construction.</description>

      <title>Tame fields, Graded Rings and Finite Complete Sequences of Key Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we link the concept of tame field to the study of graded rings and complete sequences of key polynomials. We review some definitions and results on the theory of key polynomials and Mac Lane-Vaqui\'e chains which enable us to prove that a valued field $(K,v)$ is tame if and only if the Frobenius endomorphism on the associated graded ring is surjective and every simple algebraic extension of $K$ admits a finite complete sequence of key polynomials. We present a criterion for $(K,v)$ to be henselian and defectless in terms of finite complete sequences of key polynomials. We also make some considerations on purely inertial and purely ramified extensions and their relations to properties of the associated graded ring and the module of K\"ahler differentials.</description>

      <title>Purely Inseparable ring extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of special algebras, also known as \textit{purely inseparable ring extensions}. This concept extends the notion of purely inseparable field extensions to the more general context of extensions of commutative rings. We use differential operators methods to provide a characterization for a ring extension to be purely inseparable in terms of a condition on certain modules of differential operators associated to the ring extension. This approach is also used to recover an already known characterization involving the modules of principal parts.
  Next, given a purely inseparable ring extension $A\subset C$, we aim to understand which intermediate rings $A\subset B\subset C$ satisfy the property that both $A\subset B$ and $B\subset C$ are both flat extensions by considering only the subalgebra $\operatorname{End}_B(C)$ of $\operatorname{End}_A(C)$. To achieve this, we prove a generalization of the Jacobson-Bourbaki theorem on Galois correspondence for field extensions to the setting of commutative ring extensions with homeomorphic spectra.
  Finally, given a tower of ring extensions $A\subset B\subset C$, we consider the question of whether the fact that two of the three extensions $A\subset C$, $A\subset B$, and $B\subset C$ are purely inseparable implies that the third one is also purely inseparable.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Finite Orthogonal Groups of Plus Type in Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the ring of invariants for the finite orthogonal group of plus type in odd characteristic acting on its defining representation. We also describe the invariants of its Sylow subgroup in the defining characteristic. In both cases we construct minimal algebra generating sets and describe the relations among the generators. Both rings of invariants are shown to be Complete Intersections and thus are Cohen-Macaulay. We expect the techniques we use will generalise to give a systematic computation for rings of invariants for all of the finite classical groups.</description>

      <title>Finite homological dimension of Hom and vanishing of Ext</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finitely generated modules $M$ and $N $ over a commutative Noetherian local ring $R$, we give various sufficient criteria for detecting freeness of $M$ or $N$ via vanishing of some finitely many Ext modules $\textrm{Ext}^i_R(M,N)$ and finiteness of certain homological dimension of $\textrm{Hom}_R(M,N)$. Some of our results provide partial progress towards answering a question of Ghosh-Takahashi and also generalize their main results in many ways, for instance, by reducing the number of vanishing. Certain special cases of our results allow us to address the Auslander-Reiten conjecture for modules whose (self) dual has finite projective dimension. Along the way, we also provide a negative answer to a question of Gheibi-Takahashi on characteristic modules. Among other things, the notion of residually faithful modules and certain generalizations of it play a crucial role in our study. As some applications of our results, we provide affirmative answers to two questions raised by Tony Se on $n$-semidualizing modules. Namely, we show that over a local ring of depth $t$, every $(t-1)$-semidualizing module of finite G-dimension is free. Moreover, we establish that for normal domains which satisfy Serre's condition $(S_3)$ and are locally Gorenstein in codimension two, the class of $1$-semidualizing modules form a subgroup of the divisor class group. These two groups coincide when, in addition, the ring is locally regular in codimension two.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulayness of associated graded rings of Gorenstein monomial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a Gorenstein noncomplete intersection monomial curve in the 4-dimensional affine space with defining ideal $I(C)$. In this article, we use the minimal generating set of $I(C)$ to give a criterion for determining whether the tangent cone of $C$ is Cohen-Macaulay. We also show that if the tangent cone of $C$ is Cohen-Macaulay, then the minimal number of generators of the ideal $I(C)_{\ast}$ is either $5$ or an even integer of the form $2d+2$, for a suitable integer $d$. Additionally, we provide a family of Gorenstein noncomplete intersection monomial curves $C$ whose tangent cone is Cohen-Macaulay and the minimal number of generators of $I(C)_{\ast}$ is large.</description>

      <title>On Conjecture of Binomial Edge Ideals of Linear Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of linear type when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The face numbers of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.03322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $g$-theorem is a momentous result in combinatorics that gives a complete numerical characterization of the face numbers of simplicial convex polytopes. The $g$-conjecture asserts that the same numerical conditions given in the $g$-theorem also characterizes the face numbers of all simplicial spheres, or even more generally, all simplicial homology spheres.
  In this paper, we prove the $g$-conjecture for simplicial $\mathbb{R}$-homology spheres. A key idea in our proof is a new algebra structure for polytopal complexes. Given a polytopal $d$-complex $\Delta$, we use ideas from rigidity theory to construct a graded Artinian $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $\Psi(\Delta,\nu)$ of stresses on a PL realization $\nu$ of $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where overlapping realized $d$-faces are allowed. In particular, we prove that if $\Delta$ is a simplicial $\mathbb{R}$-homology sphere, then for generic PL realizations $\nu$, the stress algebra $\Psi(\Delta,\nu)$ is Gorenstein and has the weak Lefschetz property.</description>
