      <title>Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperature above the N\'{e}el transition, despite of being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of static and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional (3D) Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover state, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the metallic state for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the Widom line, corresponding to the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions of correlated systems from graph neural networks with quantum embedding techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated systems represent a class of materials that are difficult to describe through traditional electronic structure methods. The computational demand to simulate the structural dynamics of such systems, with correlation effects considered, is substantial. Here, we investigate the structural dynamics of $f$- and $d$-electron correlated systems by integrating quantum embedding techniques with interatomic potentials derived from graph neural networks. For Cerium, a prototypical correlated $f$-electron system, we use Density Functional Theory with the Gutzwiller approximation to generate training data due to efficiency with which correlations effects are included for large multi-orbital systems. For Nickel Oxide, a prototypical correlated $d$-electron system, advancements in computational capabilities now permit the use of full Dynamical Mean Field Theory to obtain energies and forces. We train neural networks on this data to create a model of the potential energy surface, enabling rapid and effective exploration of structural dynamics. Utilizing these potentials, we delineate transition pathways between the $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, and $\alpha''$ phases of Cerium and predict the melting curve of Nickel Oxide. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning potentials to accelerate the study of strongly correlated systems, offering a scalable approach to explore and understand the complex physics governing these materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent Griffiths-phase-like behavior in the ball-milled nanocrystalline Dy4RhAl and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of dc susceptibility and heat capacity measurements on the (ball-milled) nanocrystalline rare-earth (R) ternary compound, crystallizing in Gd4RhIn type, cubic Dy4RhAl compound. The bulk form of this compound has been known to undergo antiferromagnetic ordering at (TN=) 18 K with concomitant cluster spin glass anomalies. The present studies on the nano-form obtained by ball milling reveal that this antiferromagnetic ordering is suppressed with the reduction of particle size with no feature attributable to a well defined long-range magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K, but showing an inhomogeneous magnetism below 10 K. The point being stressed is that the results show the dominance of a feature around 30 K in the magnetic susceptibility data (well above TN of the bulk form) mimicking Griffiths phase. We infer that surface magnetism dominates before long range magnetic ordering occurs in this material.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of interacting charge density waves in a layered semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coexisting orders are key features of strongly correlated materials and underlie many intriguing phenomena from unconventional superconductivity to topological orders. Here, we report the coexistence of two interacting charge-density-wave (CDW) orders in EuTe4, a layered crystal that has drawn considerable attention owing to its anomalous thermal hysteresis and a semiconducting CDW state despite the absence of perfect FS nesting. By accessing unoccupied conduction bands with time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements, we find that mono- and bi-layers of Te in the unit cell host different CDWs that are associated with distinct energy gaps. The two gaps display dichotomous evolutions following photoexcitation, where the larger bilayer CDW gap exhibits less renormalization and faster recovery. Surprisingly, the CDW in the Te monolayer displays an additional momentum-dependent gap renormalization that cannot be captured by density-functional theory calculations. This phenomenon is attributed to interlayer interactions between the two CDW orders, which account for the semiconducting nature of the equilibrium state. Our findings not only offer microscopic insights into the correlated ground state of EuTe4 but also provide a general non-equilibrium approach to understand coexisting, layer-dependent orders in a complex system.</description>

      <title>Robust spin order and fragile charge order in Na0.5CoO2 as revealed by time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy is used to investigate the charge and spin exciations in a strongly correlated electron compound Na0.5CoO2. This compound exhibits a coexistence of various charge and spin orders arising from intricate interactions among charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. NIR pulses create significantly diverse effects on the charge and spin orders; while the charge order is easily melted,coherent magnon excitations are present in all fluences examined. Furthermore, a novel {\pi} phase shift of the coherent magnon oscillations is observed in the pump-induced change of the terahertz electric field between regions of increasing and decreasing field change. These results unequivocally illustrate that ultrashort laser pulses enable the disentanglement of different interactions within complex systems characterized by multiple orders, providing a fresh perspective on the interplay between itinerant and localized electrons within the Co 3d t2g multiplets.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetoentropic response of skrymion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically magnetoentropic signatures of the crystal phase of magnetic skyrmions of various kinds, commonly appearing in two dimensions, \textit{viz.}, N\'eel, Bloch and anti skyrmions. Using Monte Carlo calculations based on spin Hamiltonians, we obtain magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_m$ in the presence of three different types of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions responsible for these skyrmions. The phase mapping of $\Delta S_m$ using skyrmion counting number $N_{sk}$ in temperature-magnetic field plane reveals fluctuation-dominated weak first-order transition in the precursor phase of the skyrmions, and a sign change in $\Delta S_m$ when the system enters into the skyrmion crystal phase -- in agreement with recent experimental findings. We also find that the fractional entropy change in going from a ferromagnetic phase to the skyrmion crystal phase is much larger compared to the conventional route of paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic phase, used for the purpose of magnetic cooling. The magnetoentropic signatures of the different types of skyrmion crystals are found to be similar. Our results indicate that the skyrmion crystals exhibit enhanced cooling efficiency and have the potential to upgrade the existing magnetic cooling methods.</description>

      <title>Quantized polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at arbitrary filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the charge polarization in a generalized Rice-Mele model at arbitrary particle filling per site as a model of charge ordered systems in one dimension. The model possesses neither the conventional bond-centered inversion symmetry nor the one site translation symmetry alone, but has combinations of these symmetries. We show that the charge polarization in the ground state is quantized by the combined symmetry and is characterized solely by the filling. Especially, the polarization can be $1/2$ (mod 1) in the zero filling limit. Under the open boundary condition, there exist excess charges accumulated near edges of the system irrespective of existence or absence of edge modes. Correspondingly, we decompose the polarization into a bulk contribution and an edge contribution, and numerically demonstrate that the polarization is dominated by the former (latter) when the energy gap is large (small). We also discuss a simple generalization of our model and examine absence/existence of a gapless edge mode protected by the inversion symmetry by introducing intra unit cell and inter unit cell contributions of the charge polarization.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Decomposition for Quantum Impurity Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving quantum impurity problems may advance our understanding of strongly correlated electron physics, but its development in multi-impurity systems has been greatly hindered due to the presence of shared bath. Here, we propose a general operation strategy to disentangle the shared bath into multiple auxiliary baths and relate the problem to a spectral decomposition problem of function matrix for applying the numerical renormalization group (NRG). We prove exactly that such decomposition is possible for models satisfying (block) circulant symmetry, and show how to construct the auxiliary baths for arbitrary impurity configuration by mapping its graph structure to the subgraph of a regular impurity configuration. We further propose an approximate decomposition algorithm to reduce the number of auxiliary baths and save the computational workload. Our work reveals a deep connection between quantum impurity problems and the graph theory, and provides a general scheme to extend the NRG applications for realistic multi-impurity systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Real Materials on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers (QC) could harbor the potential to significantly advance materials simulations, particularly at the atomistic scale involving strongly correlated fermionic systems where an accurate description of quantum many-body effects scales unfavorably with size. While a full-scale treatment of condensed matter systems with currently available noisy quantum computers remains elusive, quantum embedding schemes like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) allow the mapping of an effective, reduced subspace Hamiltonian to available devices to improve the accuracy of ab initio calculations such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we report on the development of a hybrid quantum-classical DFT+DMFT simulation framework which relies on a quantum impurity solver based on the Lehmann representation of the impurity Green's function. Hardware experiments with up to 14 qubits on the IBM Quantum system are conducted, using advanced error mitigation methods and a novel calibration scheme for an improved zero-noise extrapolation to effectively reduce adverse effects from inherent noise on current quantum devices. We showcase the utility of our quantum DFT+DMFT workflow by assessing the correlation effects on the electronic structure of a real material, Ca2CuO2Cl2, and by carefully benchmarking our quantum results with respect to exact reference solutions and experimental spectroscopy measurements.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm\pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metals in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarization modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum materials, such as time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductors.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated fermionic systems, crucial for understanding condensed matter physics, has been significantly advanced by numerical computational methods. Among these, the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method stands out for its ability to provide exact numerical solutions. However, the computational complexity of DQMC, particularly in dealing with large system sizes and the notorious sign problem, limits its applicability. We introduce an innovative approach to enhance DQMC efficiency through the implementation of submatrix updates. Building upon the foundational work of conventional fast updates and delay updates, our method leverages a generalized submatrix update algorithm to address challenges in simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems with both onsite and extended interactions at both finite and zero temperatures. We demonstrate the method's superiority by comparing it with previous update methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency. Specifically, our submatrix update method significantly reduces the computational overhead, enabling the simulation of system sizes up to 8,000 sites without pushing hard. This advancement allows for a more accurate determination of the finite temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Based Selection and Synthesis of Candidate Metal-Insulator Transition Metal Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of materials that exhibit a metal-insulator transition (MIT) is key to the development of multiple types of novel efficient microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. However, identifying MIT materials is challenging due to a combination of high computational cost of electronic structure calculations needed to understand their mechanism, the mechanisms' complexity, and the labor-intensive experimental validation process. To that end, we use a machine learning classification model to rapidly screen a high-throughput crystal structure database to identify candidate compounds exhibiting thermally-driven MITs. We focus on three candidate oxides, Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and identify their MIT mechanism using high-fidelity density functional theory calculations. Then, we provide a probabilistic estimate of which synthesis reactions may lead to their realization. Our approach couples physics-informed machine learning, density functional theory calculations, and machine learning-suggested synthesis to reduce the time to discovery and synthesis of new technologically relevant materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel lemma in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This lemma generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the stability conditions for a system of interacting fermions that conventionally involve variations of thermodynamic potentials can be rewritten in terms of local one- and two-particle correlators. We illustrate the applicability of this alternative formulation in a multi-orbital model of strongly correlated electrons at finite temperatures, inspecting the lowest eigenvalues of the generalized local charge susceptibility in proximity of the phase-separation region. Additionally to the conventional unstable branches, we address unstable solutions possessing a positive, rather than negative compressibility. Our stability conditions require no derivative of free energy functions with conceptual and practical advantages for actual calculations and offer a clear-cut criterion for analyzing the thermodynamics of correlated complex systems.</description>

      <title>Off-shell selfenergy for 1-D Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selfenergy in Born approximation including exchange of interacting one-dimensional systems is expressed in terms of a single integral about the potential which allows a fast and precise calculation for any potential analytically. The imaginary part of the self energy as damping of single-particle excitations shows a rich structure of different areas limited by single-particle and collective excitation lines. The corresponding spectral function reveals a pseudogap, a splitting of excitation into holons and antiholons as well as bound states.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and anomalies of Kitaev spin-$S$ models: Identifying symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the internal symmetries and their anomalies in the Kitaev spin-$S$ models. Importantly, these models have a lattice version of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$. There is also an ordinary 0-form $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}$ are $\pi$ spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ is the time reversal symmetry. The anomalies associated with the full $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{[1]}$ symmetry are classified by $\mathbb{Z}_2^{17}$. We find that for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$ the model is anomaly-free, while for $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$ there is an anomaly purely associated with the 1-form symmetry, but there is no anomaly purely associated with the ordinary symmetry or mixed anomaly between the 0-form and 1-form symmetries. The consequences of these symmetries and anomalies apply to not only the Kitaev spin-$S$ models, but also any of their perturbed versions, assuming that the perturbations are local and respect the symmetries. If these local perturbations are weak, generically these consequences still apply even if the perturbations break the 1-form symmetry. A notable consequence is that there should generically be a deconfined fermionic excitation carrying no fractional quantum number under the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{(x)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{(y)}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry if $S\in\mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$, which implies symmetry-enforced exotic quantum matter. We also discuss the consequences for $S\in\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A one-dimensional quantum wire of Fermions is considered and ground state properties are calculated in the high density regime within the extended quasiparticle picture and Born approximation. Expanding the two-particle Green functions determines the selfenergy and the polarization as well as the response function on the same footing. While the on-shell selfenergies are strictly zero due to Pauli-blocking of elastic scattering, the off-shell behaviour shows a rich structure of a gap in the damping of excitation which is closed when the momentum approaches the Fermi one. The consistent spectral function is presented completing the first two energy-weighted sum rules. The excitation spectrum shows a splitting due to holons and antiholons as non-Fermi liquid behaviour. A renormalization procedure is proposed by subtracting an energy constant to render the Fock exchange energy finite. The effective mass derived from meanfield shows a dip as onset of Peierls instability. The correlation energy is calculated with the help of the extended quasiparticle picture which accounts for off-shell effects. The corresponding response function leads to the same correlation energy as the selfenergy in agreement with perturbation theory. The reduced density matrix or momentum distribution is calculated with the help of a Pad\'e regularization repairing deficiencies of the perturbation theory. A seemingly finite step at the Fermi energy indicating Fermi-liquid behaviour is repaired in this way.</description>

      <title>Emergent chiral metal near a Kondo breakdown quantum phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion metal naturally emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we discuss its relevance to pertinent experiments.</description>

      <title>Surface Luttinger surfaces and Luttinger-Lifshitz transitions in topological band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with the same symmetries are necessarily separated by a bulk phase transition, while breaking the symmetry unlocks a path in parameter space that allows the phases to be connected adiabatically. Moreover, if the symmetry is broken only on the boundary, topological surface states are generically gapped and single-particle surface properties are expected to be blind to distinction between the two phases. In this work, we prove this last expectation incorrect. We first reveal that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros or ``Luttinger surfaces'' that respect the same bulk-boundary correspondence as the well-known topological surface states. Remarkably, the Luttinger surfaces survive symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Thus, a bulk topological phase transition in the presence of surface symmetry breaking causes a reconstruction of Luttinger surfaces on the surface, which we refer to as a surface Luttinger-Lifshitz transition. At non-zero temperatures, the Luttinger surfaces contribute negatively to an effective surface specific heat, and a Luttinger-Lifshitz transition manifests as a discontinuity in this specific heat.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Controlled Bond Expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group Ground State Search at Single-Site Costs" (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension $D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation.</description>

      <title>Singlet, triplet, and mixed all-to-all pairing states emerging from incoherent fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling in complex materials can be more complicated than simple density-density interactions, involving intertwined dynamics of spin, charge, and spatial symmetries. This motivates studying universal models with complex interactions, and studying whether in this case BCS-type singlet pairing is still the ``natural'' fate of the system. To this end, we construct a Yukawa-SYK model with nonlocal couplings in both spin and charge channels. Furthermore, we provide for time-reversal-symmetry breaking dynamics by averaging over the Gaussian Unitary ensemble rather than the Orthogonal ensemble. We find that the ground state of the system can be an orbitally nonlocal superconducting state arising from incoherent fermions with no BCS-like analog. The superconductivity has an equal tendency to triplet and singlet pairing states separated by a non-Fermi liquid phase. We further study the fate of the system within the superconducting phase and find that the expected ground state, away from the critical point, is a mixed singlet/triplet state. Finally, we find that while at $T_c$ the triplet and singlet transitions are dual to one another, below $T_c$ the duality is broken, with the triplet state more susceptible to orbital fluctuations just by virtue of its symmetry. Our results indicate that such fluctuation-induced mixed states may be an inherent feature of strongly correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: We study translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer codes with qudits of arbitrary, not necessarily uniform, dimensions. Using homological methods, we define a series of invariants called charge modules. We describe their properties and physical meaning. The most complete results are obtained for codes whose charge modules have Krull dimension zero. This condition is interpreted as mobility of excitations. We show that it is always satisfied for translation invariant 2D codes with unique ground state in infinite volume, which was previously known only in the case of uniform, prime qudit dimension. For codes all of whose excitations are mobile we construct a $p$-dimensional excitation and a $(D-p-1)$-form symmetry for every element of the $p$-th charge module. Moreover, we define a braiding pairing between charge modules in complementary degrees. We discuss examples which illustrate how charge modules and braiding can be computed in practice.</description>

      <title>Embedding Quantum Many-Body Scars into Decoherence-Free Subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians, which could support coherent revival dynamics from special initial states when scars form an equally spaced tower in the energy spectrum. For open quantum systems, engineering many-body scarred dynamics by a controlled coupling to the environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a general framework to exactly embed quantum many-body scars into the decoherence-free subspaces of Lindblad master equations. The dissipative scarred dynamics manifest persistent periodic oscillations for generic initial states, and can be practically utilized to prepare scar states with potential quantum metrology applications.We construct the Liouvillian dissipators with the local projectors that annihilate the whole scar towers, and utilize the Hamiltonian part to rotate the undesired states out of the null space of dissipators. We demonstrate our protocol through several typical models hosting many-body scar towers, and propose an experimental scheme to observe the dissipative scarred dynamics based on digital quantum simulations and resetting ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>Lifting topological codes: Three-dimensional subsystem codes from two-dimensional anyon models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological subsystem codes in three spatial dimensions allow for quantum error correction with no time overhead, even in the presence of measurement noise. The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. 13, 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless.</description>

      <title>Inducing a Tunable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion System through Ion Beam Modification of FeGe Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions and antiskyrmions are nanoscale swirling textures of magnetic moments formed by chiral interactions between atomic spins in magnetic non-centrosymmetric materials and multilayer films with broken inversion symmetry. These quasiparticles are of interest for use as information carriers in next-generation, low-energy spintronic applications. To develop skyrmion-based memory and logic, we must understand skyrmion-defect interactions with two main goals -- determining how skyrmions navigate intrinsic material defects and determining how to engineer disorder for optimal device operation. Here, we introduce a tunable means of creating a skyrmion-antiskyrmion system by engineering the disorder landscape in FeGe using ion irradiation. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions at varying fluences, inducing amorphous regions within the crystalline matrix. Using low-temperature electrical transport and magnetization measurements, we observe a strong topological Hall effect with a double-peak feature that serves as a signature of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. These results are a step towards the development of information storage devices that use skyrmions and anitskyrmions as storage bits and our system may serve as a testbed for theoretically predicted phenomena in skyrmion-antiskyrmion crystals.</description>

Abstract: We present three different neural network algorithms to calculate thermodynamic properties as well as dynamic correlation functions at finite temperatures for quantum lattice models. The first method is based on purification, which allows for the exact calculation of the operator trace. The second one is based on a sampling of the trace using minimally entangled states, whereas the third one makes use of quantum typicality. In the latter case, we approximate a typical infinite-temperature state by wave functions which are given by a product of a projected pair and a neural network part and evolve this typical state in imaginary time.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative study of quantum many-body correlation effects in neutron stars: Equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neutron stars have been studied for decades, their internal structure remains enigmatic, mainly due to large uncertainties in the equation of state. In neutron stars, nucleons are strongly interacting by exchanging mesons, which leads to significant quantum many-body correlation effects. Previous mean-field calculations failed to capture these effects. Here, we develop a non-perturbative quantum field-theoretic approach to handle strongly correlated nuclear matters. Based on a linear $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$ model with a density-dependent isovector coupling $\Gamma_{\rho}$, we reproduce all the six frequently-used nuclear matter observables by tuning six parameters. After including quantum many-body effects into the equation of state of realistic neutron-star matters, we obtain a mass-radius relation that is in good agreement with recent astrophysical observations. Our results show that the maximal neutron-star mass supported by neutron-dominated matters is $\sim 2.67M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is solar mass.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description for an SYK model, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extradimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections given by the Schwarzian action when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extradimension, we observe that the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients RG-flow along the extradimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. To confirm this insulating physics, we investigate thermodynamics. We obtain an effective free energy functional in terms of such bi-local dual order-parameter fields, which satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the holographic dual effective field theory. ...</description>
