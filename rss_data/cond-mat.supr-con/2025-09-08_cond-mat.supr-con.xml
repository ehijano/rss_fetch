      <title>Superconducting pairing symmetries in charge-ordered kagom\'e metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting state in a kagom\'e lattice, with intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current, using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions, treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform $s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2 lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2 periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry, such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Equal-spin and oblique-spin crossed Andreev reflections in ferromagnet/Ising superconductor/ferromagnet junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the subgap transport through a ferromagnet/Ising superconductor/ferromagnet (F/ISC/F) junction by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. It is found that the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and local Andreev reflection (LAR) strongly depend on the spin polarized F, the magnetization direction, and the Ising superconducting phase. For the same magnetization directions of the two F leads, the equal-spin CAR could take place due to spin-flip mechanism induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling and equal-spin-triplet pairing. Both equal-spin CAR and equal-spin LAR exhibit a remarkable magnetoanisotropy with period \pi and show oscillatory behavior with chemical potential. The equal-spin CAR is more prominent for half-metal F and double-band ISC while the normal CAR is completely suppressed. When the magnetization directions of the two F leads are different, the oblique-spin CAR occurs and its magnetoanisotropic period generally becomes 2\pi instead of \pi. In the oblique-spin CAR process, the spins of the electron and hole are neither parallel nor antiparallel. Furthermore, the property of oblique-spin CAR is very sensitive to the spin and valley degrees of freedom. The spin and valley polarized CAR can be achieved and controlled by the chemical potentials and the magnetization directions.</description>

      <title>Flux-flow in multiband FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ explored by microwave magnetotransport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the flux-flow resistivity in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ epitaxial films using a microwave, dual-frequency technique. The flux-flow resistivity allows to open a window on the microscopic electronic state of quasiparticles. We obtain that the field-dependence of flux-flow is typical for multiband superconductors. Once this is assessed, we are able to extract the temperature dependence of the orbital upper critical field and of the normalised vortex core quasiparticle scattering time. Our data suggest that our epitaxial FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ films are in the moderately clean regime.</description>

      <title>Fast optical data transfer into a Josephson junction array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ externally shunted Nb-AlO$_x$-Nb Josephson junctions for demonstrating a circuit that is suitable for an optically driven Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS). This technology enables overdamped junctions with characteristic frequencies above 100 GHz and critical currents of the order of 100 $\mu$A, which is promising, e.g., for low-dissipation optical control of quantum circuits such as superconducting quantum bits. Here we utilize a double-pulse technique to experimentally determine the maximum rate at which optical pulse data can be reliably delivered to the superconducting circuit. We demonstrate the feasibility of data transfer up to 60 Gbit/s, which is about factor 4 higher than for typical JAWS.</description>

      <title>Orbital Ordering in the Charge Density Wave Phases of BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW) in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering. Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni d$_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Self-heating in SIS Mixers: Experimental Evidence and Theoretical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the relationship between self-heating and the characteristic features observed in the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) of superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) junctions. Finite-element analysis is employed to evaluate the steady-state temperature distribution around SIS junctions, explicitly accounting for the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivities of the constituent materials. This approach enables flexible estimation of self-heating under various practical conditions, such as different substrate materials, interfacial thermal resistances, and geometric layouts. A heating coefficient is extracted from the simulations and used as an input parameter for IVC modeling. Incorporating self-heating through temperature-dependent gap energy and quasiparticle broadening, the simulated IVCs reproduce bending features near the energy gap that agree with measured characteristics. Furthermore, when a weak link is present near an SIS junction, its critical current can be significantly reduced by junction heating, producing unexpected bends at the linear branch of measured IVCs. Conversely, such bends may serve as indicators that the junction temperature approaches the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity two-qubit gates with transmon qubits using bipolar flux pulses and tunable couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity two-qubit gates are essential for scalable quantum computing. We present a scheme based on superconducting transmon qubits and a control pulse delivery protocol that enables arbitrary controlled-phase gates modulated solely by an independent arbitrary waveform generator pulse. We combined a tunable coupler design with bipolar flux-pulsing to demonstrate a high-fidelity gate with a performance of $99.5\%$. Our gates inherit the advantages of both approaches: minimal residual ZZ coupling, built-in echo-like low-frequency noise protection, and time-scale control pulse reproducibility, while remaining easy to calibrate. We optimize the system energy levels to mitigate leakage to the coupler and suppress residual interactions. Numerical simulations of the scheme as three qutrits indicate that an error below $1 \times 10^{-4}$ is achievable. We confirm the scalability potential of the proposed scheme on a high-fidelity 4-qubit quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Reply to the Comment by Tikhonov and Khrapai on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The comment (arXiv:2505.23490) fails to identify any scientific errors and its central arguments actually support the main conclusions of our publication [Nat. Phys. 21, 708 (2025)]. Firstly, the whole argument of the comment to try to explain our data explicitly relies on the existence of a large crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) effect. The presence of a sizable CAR transmission probability over a surprisingly long distance is the first conclusion of our publication. Secondly, the comment discusses the complex interplay of CAR and elastic co-tunneling, especially in the presence of local effects. This complex interplay is precisely the second conclusion of our publication. In essence, the comment amounts to merely pointing out that there is a broader sense in the notion of "dominant CAR" when nonlinear effects become relevant.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Unusual Temperature Dependence of the Upper Critical Field of Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5: Multiple Bands or van Hove Singularities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in barium hydrides via incorporation of light elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barium hydrides are of interest for their potential in both ionic conductivity and superconductivity. Recently, a superconducting hydride BaH$_{12}$ containing H$_2$ and H${_3}^{-1}$ molecular units was experimentally reported with a critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ of 20 K at 140 GPa [Nat Commun 12, 273 (2021)]. Herein, we combine ab initio methods with a rapid calculator of $T_\text{c}$ based on the networking value model to predict that the introduction of light elements, such as Be, can effectively expand the structure diversity and structure space of barium hydrides. Although molecular hydrogen units are still widely present in thermodynamically stable and metastable crystal structures, we find that a metastable phase of BeBaH$_8$ shows a high $T_\text{c}$ of 49 K at 100 GPa, which is only 38 meV/atom above the thermodynamic stability energy. This BeBaH$_8$ remains dynamically stable at 15 GPa. Furthermore, our study shows that increasing pressure can further elevate $T_\text{c}$ beyond 100 K by enhancing the electron-phonon coupling constant. Our study proposes a feasible method for broadening the structural landscape in the exploration of superconducting phases of barium hydrides.</description>

      <title>Tuning the the fundamental periodicity of the current-phase relation in multiterminal diffusive Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional superconductor/insulator/superconductor (SIS) Josephson junctions, devices where two superconductors are separated by a tunnel barrier are technologically important as elements in quantum circuits, particularly with their key role in superconducting qubits. An important characteristic of Josephson junctions is the relation between the supercurrent Is and the phase difference $\phi$ between them. For SIS junctions, the current-phase relation is sinusioidal and 2$\pi$ periodic. Other types of Josephson junctions, where the material between the superconductors is a weak link or a normal metal (N) may have non-sinusoidal current-phase relations that are still 2$\pi$ periodic. We show here that a multi-terminal diffusive SNS Josephson junction with 4 superconducting contacts can show a current phase relation between two of the contacts that is a superposition of 2$\pi$ and 4$\pi$ periodic components whose relative strength is controlled by the phase difference between the other two contacts, becoming 2$\pi$ or 4$\pi$ periodic for certain values of this phase difference. This tunability might have applications in tailoring the Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\rm c}$). Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum ($T_{\rm c}$) of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

Abstract: We report on observation of two coherent quantum phenomena, the current quantization in theJosephson Junction (JJ) and the Aharonov-Cashier effect. The synergy of two effects is seen as the phase locking of the JJ with the oscillating charge engaged by the microwaves (the current quantization), and a control of the phase locking phenomenon with the static charge of the gate electrode (the Aharonov-Cashier effect). The experimental system consists of two coupled JJs in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. When the microwave is applied, the quantized current plateaus appear on the I - V curve. The effect is dual to the Shapiro voltage steps in JJs. We modulate the quantized current with the static charge induced by the gate electrode. Conceptually, the system has the functionality of the Bloch Transistor: it can deliver gate-controlled quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Charge gap and charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals in the normal state of the Emery model</title>

Abstract: Unraveling the behavior of the electrons in the copper-oxygen planes of cuprate superconductors remains a challenge. Here we examine the electronic charge redistribution among planar copper and oxygen orbitals and the charge gap using the Emery model in the normal state, solved with cellular dynamical mean-field theory at finite temperature. We quantify the charge redistribution as a function of the onsite Coulomb repulsion on the copper orbitals, the bare copper-oxygen energy difference, and the hole or electron doping. We find that the position relative to the metal to insulator boundary of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen diagram determines the charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals. For a fixed bare Cu-O energy difference, an increase in the Cu electron repulsion leads to a transfer of the electronic charge from Cu to O orbitals. For a fixed charge gap size of the undoped state, as the system evolves from a charge-transfer to a Mott-Hubbard regime, the electronic charge is transferred from Cu to O orbitals. Our findings posit the Coulomb repulsion and the bare charge-transfer energy as key drivers of the microscopic process of charge redistribution in the CuO$_2$ plane. They quantify the anticorrelation between the charge gap size and oxygen hole content. They show that for fixed band-structure parameters, the charge gap and the charge redistribution between Cu and O orbitals provide a way to understand observed trends in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: III. Thermodynamic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.</description>
