      <title>General expression for the energy and the equation of state for polycrystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of the extended classical elasticity theory, we propose universal semi-empirical analytical expressions for the energy and the equation of state for poly-crystalline solids. The validation of the relations has been made by means of first principle density functional theory simulations with the use of pseudo-potential approach and generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. The calculations performed for a large number of inorganic crystalline compounds with metal, covalent and ionic bonding (including diamond, Mg, sphalerite, B, magnesium carboboride, topaz, rocksalt, etc.) within the pressure range from -20 GPa to 300 GPa demonstrated an excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory. The proposed relations can be used to describe the behavior of poly-crystalline solids at high pressure, in particular, to predict pressure-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Attention to Order: Transformers Discover Phase Transitions via Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior, yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is considered in case when medium polarization is caused by parallel component of neighboring spins. The result is presented for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. A comparison is given with the contribution of magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert equation when medium polarization is caused by perpendicular component of spins. The dispersion dependence of spin waves in antiferromagnets with cycloidal equilibrium spin order is derived. The electric susceptibility and permittivity of antiferromagnetic multiferroics in which magnetoelectric effect is caused by collinear component of spins is obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport in Topological Materials and Nonlinear Hall Effect via First-Principles Electronic Interactions and Band Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field, consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Chromium-doped uranium dioxide fuels: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UO2 doped with parts per million Cr2O3 powder is considered a potential near term accident tolerant fuel candidate. Here, the results of decades of industry and academic research into Cr-doped UO2 are analyzed and their shortcomings are critiqued. Focusing on the incorporation mechanisms of Cr into the fuel matrix, we explore a mechanistic understanding of the characteristic properties of Cr-doped UO2, notably, enhanced fission gas retention attributed to enlarged grain sizes following sintering, along with marginal improvements in the thermophysical properties. The findings of recent X-ray Adsorption Near Edge Spectroscopy studies were compared and put into conversation with historic data regarding the incorporation of Cr in UO2. On the basis of defect mechanisms, the case is made for the substitutional incorporation of Cr governing the lattice solubility but not the enhanced U diffusivity. Instead, Cr/Cr2O3 redox chemistry in a well-defined oxygen potential explains the differences in the U diffusivity and O/M ratio. The primary mechanism of doping-enhanced grain growth is found to be liquid assisted sintering due to a CrO(l) eutectic phase at the grain boundaries. The role of inhomogeneities in Cr concentration in UO2 at various length scales across the materials microstructure is highlighted and connected to promising experimental and modeling work to fill in the gaps in the current understanding of Cr-doped UO2. The review ends with an outline of future works that combine meticulous irradiation studies and high resolution experiments with next generation modeling and simulations techniques empowered by machine learning advances to accelerate the fabrication and adoption of Cr-doped UO2 light water reactors.</description>

      <title>Probing Phase Diagrams of Ordered Two-Dimensional Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water, a ubiquitous and fundamental substance, plays a critical role across a wide range of disciplines from physics and chemistry to biology and engineering. Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls, experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer and Cu(111) as the substrate. This protocol enables scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to resolve the atomic-scale arrangement of water molecules beneath the h-BN layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques. Simulated STM images unambiguously identify all ordered flat 2D ice phases, as well as coexisting phases, and effectively distinguish them from potential contaminants. These findings establish a robust framework for experiment to systematically probe the phase structures of 2D ice, opening an avenue for studying nanoconfined water under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Dimension- and Facet-Dependent Altermagnetic Triferroics and Biferroics in CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Modulating thermal conductivity of bulk BAs based on targeted phonon excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a reversible phonon excitation strategy to dynamically modulate the thermal conductivity of boron arsenide (BAs), addressing the opposing thermal conductivity requirements in electronics and thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport equation, we demonstrate that selective excitation of specific phonon modes enables active control over thermal transport. At an excitation multiplier of 25, the thermal conductivity of BAs can be enhanced by up to 2% or suppressed by up to 35% relative to its intrinsic value of 2235 W m^-1 K^-1. At a lower multiplier of 5, thermal conductivity can be increased by 2% or decreased by 11%. The modulation effect depends on excitation frequency, multiplier, and intrinsic phonon properties, with certain frequencies exhibiting opposite trends under different excitation intensities. Mechanistic analysis shows that at low excitation levels, phonon splitting suppresses Umklapp scattering, reducing the scattering rate, while at high levels, it enhances Normal scattering, increasing the scattering rate. This approach offers a dynamic and reversible route to tuning thermal conductivity, with applications in thermal management and thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy enables the growth of thin film materials with novel properties and functionalities. Typically, the lattice constants of films and substrates are designed to match to minimise disorders and strains. However, significant lattice mismatches can result in higher-order epitaxy, where commensurate growth occurs with a period defined by integer multiples of the lattice constants. Despite its potential, higher-order epitaxy is rarely used to enhance material properties or induce emergent phenomena. Here, we report single-crystalline FeTe films grown via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals self-organised periodic interstitials near the interface, arising from higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction shows that the tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition in bulk FeTe is strongly suppressed. Remarkably, these films exhibit substrate-selective two-dimensional superconductivity, likely due to suppressed monoclinic distortion. These findings demonstrate the potential of higher-order epitaxy as a tool to control materials and inducing emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated Radiation and Phonon-driven Quenching of Excitons in a Layered Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the N\'eel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned exchange and hysteresis in a bilayer van der Waals magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3{\deg}. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moir\'e supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Engineering of NaAlO3 Perovskites Unlocks Unified Optoelectronic, Thermoelectric, and Spintronic Functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.</description>

Here, we further extend the concept to other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. %
Besides the common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the $\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and N\'eel-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Mechanical coupling of polar topologies and oxygen octahedra rotations in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies -- including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$ and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.</description>

      <title>Observation of electromagnons in a monolayer multiferroic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet optical conductivity, exciton fine-structure and dispersion of freestanding monolayer h-BN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover, measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation (OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV) optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermal stability of inverted perovskite solar cells by bulky passivation with pyridine-functionalized triphenylamine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85{\deg}C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Microstructure and phase stability within the AlMoNbTiZr system: design tools and compositional boundaries for a high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores Ti-containing complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) within the AlMoNbTiZr system, focusing on compositions located in regions of the Bo-Md diagram characterized by low bond order (Bo) and d-orbital energy level (Md). Four alloys were designed near the line predicting stress-induced martensite formation in conventional Ti alloys, then cast, annealed at 1200{\deg}C, and water quenched. Their microstructures and phases were analyzed and compared against phase prediction tools commonly applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), namely empirical parameters and CALPHAD simulations. Results highlight the strong influence of chemical affinity, particularly the roles of Al, Mo, and Zr concentrations, on solid-solution stability. A maximum Al content of 10 at% was identified as the threshold for achieving a single-phase microstructure, observed in the 10Al15Mo10Nb35Ti30Zr alloy. This alloy exhibited a bcc/b2 structure with high compressive strength (above 1300 MPa), low Young's modulus (28 GPa), and limited strain (&lt;6%), but lacked the transformation-induced strengthening mechanisms expected for Ti alloys with comparable Bo-Md values.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Dependent Electronic Energy Losses in Ion Range Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</description>

      <title>Learning to predict superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Multi-Bit Pulse Encoding in In2O3/Al2O3 Thin-film Transistors for Temporal Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.</description>

Abstract: Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</description>

      <title>Observation of Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \&amp; $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory, we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.</description>

      <title>Surface band-selective moir\'e effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of 25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moir\'e effects.</description>

      <title>Atomically resolved electron reflectivity at a metal/semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An atomically flat interface is achieved between face-centered cubic Al and diamond lattice Ge via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Based on the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate an atomically resolved lateral periodic change of the electron reflectivity at the Al/Ge interface. The variation of electron reflectivity is up to 24% in lateral 2 nm. We speculate that the change of reflectivity results from the local electronic states at the Al/Ge interface. This phenomenon provides an atomically non-destructive method for detecting the buried interfacial states in hetero-structures by STM.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Hot-carrier generation in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of graphene via the saddle point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</description>

      <title>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</description>

      <title>Classical to Quantum Diffusive Transport in Atomically Thin Semiconductors Capped with High-k Dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15474v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the N\'eel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Deterministic control of coupled ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders remains a central challenge in multiferroics, limiting their integration into functional magnetoelectrics and magnonic-devices. (111)pc BiFeO3 with a robust single spin cycloid, offers direct magnetoelectric-coupling and a platform for efficient spin transport, yet multi-magnetic domains and ferroelectric-fatigue have prevented reproducible control. Here, we show that anisotropic-compressive in-plane strain stabilizes a single antiferromagnetic domain with unique spin-cycloid vector, by breaking the symmetry of the (111)pc plane. Epitaxial BiFeO3 films grown on orthorhombic NdGaO3 (011)o [(111)pc] substrates impose the required anisotropic in-plane strain and stabilizes single antiferromagnetic domain, as confirmed through direct imaging with scanning NV microscopy and non-resonant-x-ray-magnetic-scattering. Remarkably, these engineered films exhibit deterministic and non-volatile 180{\deg} switching of ferroelectric and single antiferromagnetic domains over 1,000 cycles. The monodomain state also enables anisotropic and threefold enhanced magnon transport with reduced scattering. Thus, symmetry-designed (111)pc monodomain BiFeO3 offers a robust platform for advanced magnetoelectric and magnonic applications.</description>

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions (2D) proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed-melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some 2D systems. Here, we imaged silver iodide (AgI) embedded in multilayer graphene using time and temperature resolved in-situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observe the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.</description>

Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</description>

      <title>Neutral but Impactful: Gallium Cluster-Induced Nanopores from Beam-Blanked Gallium Ion Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>

Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, and propose a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating via deep-UV interactions. Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to future cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of Metal Hydrides from Metal and Acids</title>

Abstract: Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films on GaAs (111) substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of 1T$'$ and 1T CrS2 and Cr2S3 by MOCVD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of crystal phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only but not experimentally verified. Here we demonstrate a previously unreported crystal phase of CrS2, namely the distorted octahedral (1T$'$) structure, synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ or 1T phase CrS2. The structure were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as well as scanning electron diffraction (4D-STEM). 4D-STEM reveals that 1T$'$ crystals grow from an originally nucleated kinetically favoured 1T phase which then transform into the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging reveals that the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature. Our MOCVD growth of complex phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Determining the density of in-gap states in organic semiconductors: A pitfall of photoelectron yield spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network approach to the point defect model for electrochemical oxide film growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with bespoke properties have long been identified by computational searches, and their experimental realisation is now coming within reach through autonomous laboratories. Scattering experiments are central to verifying the atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate multi-component metallic glass systems using a hybrid Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Variance-Constrained Semi-Grand Canonical approach. This method enables us to generate samples with properties consistent with experimental observations, at deeply supercooled states that are typically inaccessible with conventional MD simulations. Using a realistic interatomic potential, we investigate the dynamics, kinetic stability, and rheology of a ZrCuAl metallic glass, together with the widely studied ZrCu system, in the low-temperature glassy regime, specifically, for ZrCu below its experimental glass-transition temperature. Our results demonstrate how the hybrid method enhances relaxation and provides a generic framework for modeling realistic complex metallic glasses in close agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Recommendations and tools to enable reproducibility in 2D materials research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation: A Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-layer graphene heterostructures in which the layers are twisted by the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^\circ$) or by $\sim$$30^\circ$ to form a graphene quasicrystal. The heterostacks are described using realistic structural relaxations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and their transport properties are computed for both pristine and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. Owing to the weak interlayer coupling, we resolve the hybridization between magic-angle flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are modified in distinct ways across low- and high-energy windows, revealing a new hybrid electronic regime to explore.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Unified Cross-Scale 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregressive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D structure modeling is essential across scales, enabling applications from fluid simulation and 3D reconstruction to protein folding and molecular docking. Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales. We propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. To address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance. Extensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.</description>

      <title>Load-Dependent Power-Law Exponent in Creep Rupture of Heterogeneous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Monopole Traps for Position-Based Information Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Sinc basis set for molecular orbitals calculation of cavity in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.</description>
