      <title>Shell effects in quasi-fission for calcium induced reactions forming thorium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum shell effects induce an asymmetric fission mode in actinides, which disappears in neutron deficient isotopes. Quasi-fission, characterized by a significant mass transfer in heavy ion collisions at low-energies, is expected to be affected by similar shell effects. This is studied in 40-56Ca+176Yb reactions with the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach. All reactions exhibit a mass equilibration process that stops when a heavy fragment with Z~54 protons is formed. Unlike the fission of thorium compound nuclei, quasi-fission does not exhibit a transition to symmetric modes in neutron deficient systems. This observation is interpreted in terms of potential energy surfaces that show a persistence of an asymmetric valley with an increasing barrier preventing its population in fission of the most neutron deficient thorium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Optimized binning for response function reconstruction via Chebyshev expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optimized histogram binning strategy to reconstruct nuclear response functions via the Chebyshev expansion bound-state method. Our approach employs a stochastic regularization of the density of states to define adaptive, equal-area bins. Using the deuteron solved in a harmonic-oscillator basis with a chiral interaction, we benchmark on dipole and longitudinal responses, obtaining excellent agreement with exact theory and experiment. This general framework readily extends to other many-body systems and opens the door to new ab initio calculations of lepton-nucleus cross sections in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>Microscopic pairing in fission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fission can be modelled as a quantum tunneling process driven by the interplay between the nuclear binding energy and the collective inertia. Within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formalism, spontaneous fission half-lives can be obtained by minimizing the action integral in the multidimensional space of collective degrees of freedom. Hence, including the relevant collective variables is crucial for properly describing spontaneous fission probabilities. Pairing correlations play an essential role in this evaluation since the collective inertia decreases as the inverse of the square of the pairing gap, and, therefore, they should be considered as a relevant degree of freedom on the same footing as deformation parameters. In this work, we show that the spontaneous fission half-lives in fermium isotopes can be reproduced in a microscopic theory by considering the least-action fission path in a two-dimensional space with constraints on the quadrupole moment and pairing correlations. We consider two microscopic quantities as degrees of freedom associated with pairing: the pairing gap parameter $\Delta$, and the particle number fluctuations $\langle \Delta N^2 \rangle$. Least-action paths, computed using the Dijkstra algorithm, are compared with minimum-energy paths, highlighting the importance of pairing correlations as a dynamical degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Collectivity of rotational motion in $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations to reconstruct rotational level patterns in the $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra nuclei have been performed using a collective quadrupole+octupole approach with microscopic mass tensor and moments of inertia dependent on deformation and pairing degrees of freedom. The main objective is to quantitatively confirm the known experimental observations that the Rn nucleus passes from octupole vibrational to octupole deformed with increasing rotation frequency, while the Ra nucleus is relatively weakly affected by collective rotation, being octupole deformed from the beginning. The collective potential in a nine-dimensional collective space is determined using the macroscopic-microscopic method with Strutinsky and the BCS with an approximate particle number projection microscopic corrections. The corresponding Hamiltonian is diagonalized based on the projected solutions of the harmonic oscillators coupled with Wigner functions. Such an orthogonalized basis is additionally symmetrized with respect to the so-called intrinsic symmetrization group, specifically dedicated to the collective space used, to ensure the uniqueness of the Hamiltonian eigen-solutions in the laboratory frame. The response of the pairing and deformation degrees of freedom to external rotation is discussed in the variational approach, where the total energy is minimized by the deformation and pairing variables. Consequently, the corresponding microscopic moments of inertia increase with collective spin (Coriolis {\it antiparing} effect), resulting in effectively lower rotational energy levels I$^{\pi}$ with respect to pure classical-rotor pattern I(I+1). The obtained comparison of experimental and theoretical rotational energy level schemes, dipole, quadrupole and octupole transition probabilities of B(E$\lambda$) in $^{220}$Rn and $^{226}$Ra is satisfactory.</description>

      <title>On the angular momentum of many-nucleon states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to construct total angular momentum of many-nucleon states. We find that when restoring the broken rotational symmetry of the product state by angular momentum projection, the restrictions on the total states required by the fermionic antisymmetry are completely absorbed into the single j space. For different j shells, any total angular momentum that obeys the selection rule is allowed, just as for non-identical particles. Our method based on this reorganization changes fundamentally the thinking of the J- and m-schemes and is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of traditional shell models.</description>

      <title>Recurring region for neutron-star observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we report a new phenomena of recurring regions when relating observables for hybrid neutron stars and hybrid neutron-star mergers. To describe dense matter within hybrid stars, we introduce a percolation to vary the size and characteristics of the deconfinement phase transition to quark matter. Before and after the percolation, we keep the hadronic and quark phases the same, described by different realistic models for the equation of state of beta-equilibrated, charge-neutral, zero-temperature matter. When solving spherical and deformed equations for neutron stars in general relativity, we find that: no matter the size or characteristics of the percolation region, or the order of the phase transition on either side (hadronic and quark), as long as we minimize the average sound speed from the beginning of the percolation region to the central density for a given star, we can produce equations of state that cross through the same, small recurring region within mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability diagrams. Our findings provide a new way to produce hybrid equations of state for dense matter that match a given observation of neutron stars or neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Studying few cluster resonances with quantum neural network driven iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the quantum computing the properties of hypernuclei ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He, ${}^{\ 6}_{{\Lambda\Lambda}}$He and ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be can be investigated within microscopic cluster model. Our approach combines quantum neural network (QNN) with iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (IHHL) algorithm (abbreviated as QNN-IHHL) to solve the quantum many-body problem. To efficiently describe resonance phenomena, we employ complex scaling and eigenvector continuation techniques, providing a robust framework for identifying few-cluster resonance parameters within quantum computing. To validate our quantum algorithm, the resonant $4^{+}$ state of ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be is chosen as a core example. With QNN-IHHL algorithm we realize a fully quantum workflow, which provides a novel framework and some ground work for exploring resonance properties in complex nuclear many-body systems.</description>

      <title>QCD antenna radiative spectrum in dense media: accounting for full jet-medium interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the double differential inclusive spectrum for the emission of a soft gluon from a color-singlet $q\bar q$ pair traversing a dense QCD medium. Our results extend the existing literature by simultaneously incorporating both single hard and multiple soft gluon exchanges between the jet and the medium -- an essential ingredient for a complete phenomenological description of jet quenching. Using the Improved Opacity Expansion framework, we provide an analytically tractable treatment, reducing the full cross-section to a set of simple expressions. Our analysis demonstrates that rare hard (Moli\`ere) scatterings significantly modify the gluon spectrum at large angles, accelerating the loss of color coherence between the initial quarks. We further quantify whether the modifications are driven by an overall weakening of the interference term, or by more detailed modifications to the fragmentation pattern. Our results provide a direct input for phenomenological jet quenching studies, offering new insights into the role of color decoherence in QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ where the von Neumann entropy of the vacuum attains its maximum. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities of rotating quark matter in Fourier-Bessel basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze various two-point correlation functions of fermionic bilinears in a rotating finite-size cylinder at finite temperatures, with a focus on susceptibility functions. Due to the noninvariance of radial translation, the susceptibility functions are constructed using the Dirac propagator in the Fourier-Bessel basis instead of the plane-wave basis. As a specific model to demonstrate the susceptibility functions in an interacting theory, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the incompatibility between the mean-field analysis and the Fourier-Bessel basis is evaded under the local density approximation, and derive the resummation formulas of susceptibilities with the help of a Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting formulation reveals the rotational effects on meson, baryon number, and topological susceptibilities, as well as the moment of inertia. Our results may serve a useful benchmark for future lattice QCD simulations in rotating frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations. Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the foundation for the controllable gravitational quantum optics on Earth.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of rescattering effect on vector mesons spin alignment at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin alignment of vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe of quark polarization and hadronization mechanism in quark-gluon plasma. Hadronic rescattering may affect the measured spin alignment of vector mesons due to non-uniform rescattering probability in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Using the UrQMD model, we systematically investigated the hadronic rescattering effect on the measurement of $\rho_{00}$, the spin alignment parameter, for $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $\rho^{0}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV. Our results reveal that the measurable $\rho_{00} - 1/3$ remains unaffected for $\phi$, while shows significantly negative (positive) deviations for $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^0$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Quantitatively, the maximum deviation reaches $-0.0056$ ($0.0268$) for $K^{*0}$ and $-0.0122$ ($0.0414$) for $\rho^{0}$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Notably, the deviations in $\rho_{00}$ for both $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^{0}$ increase monotonically with increasing collision energy. These findings underscore the critical necessity of accounting for rescattering effects when interpreting spin alignment measurements of short-lived vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). Utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurements $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}&lt;800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers. In this work, we derive the evolution equation for the bulk viscous pressure in unpaired quark matter under small deviations from equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that it behaves like a two-component Burgers fluid. We identify four key transport coefficients -- two relaxation times and two bulk viscosity coefficients -- expressed in terms of equilibrium parameters and electroweak nonleptonic and semi-leptonic decay rates. The transport coefficients are evaluated for two distinct equations of state: one based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the other on a modified MIT bag model, valid in different density regimes. We also determine the temperature and density region where nonleptonic electroweak processes dominate the dissipation. Our formulation establishes a new way of describing bulk viscous effects in quark matter, applicable for numerical simulations of compact star mergers.</description>

      <title>Interplay of prompt and non-prompt photons in photon-triggered jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt photons are important yet challenging to observe in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are produced in the early stages and traverse almost the entire QGP medium without interaction. Experimental analyses typically employ isolation cuts, in the hope to identify prompt photons. Most theoretical studies consider only events with actual prompt photons, assuming no contribution from isolated non-prompt photons to reduce computational cost. For the first time, we present a study that compares simulation results generated using inclusive (bremsstrahlung) and prompt-photon events with multiple experimental observables for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $5.02$ TeV. Simulations are carried out using the multi-stage JETSCAPE framework tuned to describe the quenching of jets and hadrons. Isolated non-prompt photons are generated in hard photon bremsstrahlung, where the photon is radiated at a sufficient angle to the jet. Several photon triggered jet and jet substructure observables show significant contributions from inclusive photons, yielding an improvement in comparison with experimental data. Novel photon triggered jet substructure observables are also expected to show new structures, yet to be detected in experiment. This effort examines the significance of isolated non-prompt photons using parameters tuned for a simultaneous description of the leading hadron and jet spectrum, and thus provides an independent verification of the multistage evolution framework.</description>

      <title>Observational Probes of the Neutron Star Equation of State with Hyperons, Bosonic Dark Matter, and Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of dark matter in neutron stars is of growing interest due to its possible impact on their structure and observables. Among proposed candidates, the hypothetical sexaquark has emerged as a promising bosonic dark matter particle, potentially forming under extreme conditions in neutron star cores. We investigate this scenario using a relativistic density functional approach, including hyperons (DD2Y-T model) for the hadronic phase, coupled to a deconfined quark phase described by a non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The phase transition is modeled through a smooth crossover, and sexaquark-baryon interactions are introduced via an effective mass shift representing repulsion. We assess whether this hybrid scenario, incorporating hyperons, bosonic dark matter, and deconfined quark matter, is consistent with multi-messenger constraints from neutron stars. By scanning the parameter space, we identify sexaquark masses that are consistent with mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability. Our results show that the presence of the sexaquark softens the equation of state, enabling the model to satisfy both the radius and tidal deformability constraints around the canonical $1.4M_\odot$ neutron stars. We incorporate all available NICER data, including PSR J0437-4715 and newly published PSR J0614-3329. We find out that hybrid stars with sexaquark mass near 1900 MeV agree with all current observational limits, including HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, representing the lightest and most massive known neutron stars. Furthermore, we perform a Bayesian analysis, which yields a favored sexaquark mass range of 1885-1935 MeV, supporting the potential role of this exotic particle in the interiors of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of $T'$-Expansion Scheme: Hadron Resonance Gas and Cluster Expansion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we assess the effectiveness and robustness of the recently proposed $T'$-expansion scheme for expanding the equation of state of strongly interacting matter to finite density, by comparing its performance relative to the conventional Taylor expansion method in various effective QCD models. We use baryon number density and its susceptibilities to calculate the expansion coefficients in the $T'$-expansion scheme with and without the Stefan-Boltzmann limit correction. Our methodology involves comparing truncation orders to exact solutions to assess the scheme's accuracy. We utilize Ideal, Excluded Volume, and van der Waals formulations of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model at low temperatures, and the Cluster Expansion Model at higher temperatures. Our findings indicate that the $T'$-expansion scheme offers superior convergence properties near and above the chiral crossover temperature, where the chiral-criticality-inspired scaling $(\partial/ \partial T)_{\mu_B} \sim (\partial^2/\partial \mu_B^2)_T$ holds. However, it shows limited improvement in the HRG models, indicating that it may not be the most suitable choice for describing the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Moments of inertia of rare-earth nuclei and the nuclear time-odd mean fields within exact solutions of the adiabatic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically analyse the nuclear moments of inertia determined within the Skyrme and Gogny density functional theories. The time-odd mean fields generated by collective rotation are self-consistently determined by a novel exact iterative solution of the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) equations. Although details of the results depend on the functional used, the calculated moments of inertia are in good overall agreement with the experimental data, with no adjustable parameters. To show the essential importance of the time-odd mean fields, we compared the ATDHFB moments of inertia with those obtained from the Inglis-Belyaev formula. For Skyrme density functionals, we find strong correlations between the effective mass and the impact of the time-odd mean fields on the rotational and vibrational collective inertia.</description>

      <title>The study of quantum fluctuation energies over a spatially inhomogeneous field background in a chiral soliton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on chiral soliton models, the quantum fluctuation energies of quarks over a spatially inhomogeneous meson field background have been thoroughly studied. We have used a systematic calculation scheme initiated by Schwinger, in which the loop quantum fluctuation energies are evaluated by a nontrivial level summation over the eigenvalue spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian of the system. The effective Hamiltonian can be constructed by one loop effective action of fluctuations of quarks over a static chiral soliton field background. The corresponding Dirac equation is obtained. In a static and spatially spherical case and by the hedgehog ansatz the radial part and the angular part of the grand spin of the wave function for the Dirac equation can be separated. Due to the soliton background the eigenvalue spectrum are distorted. The scattering phase shift can be determined by solve the radial equations at different momentum. The density of states in momentum space can be derived. The effective Hamiltonian has been diagonalized in a Hilbert space where the eigenfunctions are labeled by the parity, grand spin and energy. The renormalization scheme can be carried out by a Born subtraction of the phase shift and the compensating Feynman diagram renormalization. Finally the finite quantum fluctuation energies over chiral soliton background at different parities and grand spins have been numerically evaluated, compared and discussed.</description>

      <title>Preponderant Orbital Polarization in Relativistic Magnetovortical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF and scale uncertainties cancel dramatically while showing little sensitivity to parton shower and hadronization models, addressing a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>
