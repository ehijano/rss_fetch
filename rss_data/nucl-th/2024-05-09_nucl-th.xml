      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy Ion Collisions: The Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei from coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method to describe electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei with two nucleons outside a closed shell. This approach combines the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for such systems and the Lorentz integral transform technique, expanding the applicability of coupled-cluster theory for these properties beyond closed-shell nuclei. To validate this new approach, we compute the non-energy-weighted dipole sum rule and the dipole polarizability of $^{16,24}$O in both the closed-shell and the new equation-of-motion coupled-cluster frameworks, finding agreement within error bars. We then analyze the evolution of the dipole polarizability along the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. Our predictions agree well with available experimental data and other available theoretical calculations for the closed-shell $^{16,22}$O and the open-shell $^{18}$O. In the calcium isotopes, we observe that our dipole polarizability predictions for open-shell nuclei are lower than those of closed-shell nuclei. Our predictions for $^{24}$O and $^{54,56}$Ca will motivate future experimental studies at the dripline.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Exotic Stable Branches with Efficient TOV Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that are guaranteed to identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Hedgehog Skyrmion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radial profile function of the hedgehog Skyrmion with unit baryon number in generic EFTs (effective field theories) of pions. The analysis assumes chiral symmetry and ignores the pion mass term. The Skyrmion is always smooth, because it has no point source at the origin, and terms in the EFT with higher numbers of pion derivatives do not result in uncontrolled large corrections or singularities there. The profile varies in quite a limited way as the terms in the EFT change, and a universal profile function is proposed.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon forces are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Effects of incompressibility $K_{0}$ in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the possible least uncertainty on the nuclear incompressibility $K_{0}$, we examine effects of $K_{0}$ in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies. Based on simulations of Au + Au collision at 400 MeV/nucleon using an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model, we find that the incompressibility $K_{0}$ indeed affects significantly the attainable density in central regions, and thus the particle productions and/or distributions at final states, e.g., nucleon rapidity distributions and yields of charged pions. Nevertheless, through examining the free neutron over proton ratios $n/p$, the neutron-proton differential transverse and directed flows as well as the charged pion ratio $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ and its kinetic energy distribution, we find that these observables are less affected by the uncertainty of $K_{0}$, but mainly sensitive to the slope of symmetry energy at the saturation density. We also compare and discuss our results with the corresponding data.</description>

      <title>Generator coordinate method with proton--neutron pairing fluctuations and magnetic properties of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairing correlations play an important role in a variety of nuclear phenomena. However, a quantitative understanding of proton--neutron $(pn)$ pairing, especially isoscalar $pn$ pairing $(S=1, T=0)$ remains elusive. To clarify the property of $pn$ pairing, we investigate the roles of $pn$ pairing in the $M1$ transition of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei. We develop a theoretical model based on the generator coordinate method (GCM) in which the isoscalar and isovector $pn$-pair amplitudes are used as the generator coordinates. Using the particle and the angular-momentum projections, the $pn$-pair GCM well reproduces the $M1$ transition of odd--odd nuclei for the exactly solvable SO(8) model. We apply the method to $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei and find that the experimental values of $B(M1)$ are well reproduced. We also study the sensitivity of $B(M1)$ to the strength of the isoscalar pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>Leveraging neural control variates for enhanced precision in lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results obtained with stochastic methods have an inherent uncertainty due to the finite number of samples that can be achieved in practice. In lattice QCD this problem is particularly salient in some observables like, for instance, observables involving one or more baryons and it is the main problem preventing the calculation of nuclear forces from first principles. The method of control variables has been used extensively in statistics and it amounts to computing the expectation value of the difference between the observable of interest and another observable whose average is known to be zero but is correlated with the observable of interest. Recently, control variates methods emerged as a promising solution in the context of lattice field theories. In our current study, instead of relying on an educated guess to determine the control variate, we utilize a neural network to parametrize this function. Using 1+1 dimensional scalar field theory as a testbed, we demonstrate that this neural network approach yields substantial improvements. Notably, our findings indicate that the neural network ansatz is particularly effective in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly form factors from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadron mass can be obtained through the calculation of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in the hadron which includes the trace anomaly and sigma terms. The anomaly due to conformal symmetry breaking is believed to be an important ingredient for hadron mass generation and confinement. In this work, we will present the calculation of the glue part of the trace anomaly form factors of the pion up to $Q^2\sim 4.3~\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and the nucleon up to $Q^2\sim 1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculations are performed on a domain wall fermion ensemble with overlap valence quarks at seven valence pion masses varying from $\sim 250$ to $\sim 540$ MeV, including the unitary point $\sim 340$ MeV. We calculate the radius of the glue trace anomaly for the pion and the nucleon from the $z$ expansion. By performing a two-dimensional Fourier transform on the glue trace anomaly form factors in the infinite momentum frame with no energy transfer, we also obtain their spatial distributions for several valence quark masses. The results are qualitatively extrapolated to the physical valence pion mass with systematic errors from the unphysical sea quark mass, discretization effects in the renormalization sum rule, and finite-volume effects to be addressed in the future. We find the pion's form factor changes sign, as does its spatial distribution, for light quark masses. This explains how the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass approaches zero toward the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Stability and causality of rest frame modes in second-order spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the low- and high-momentum rest frame modes in the second-order spin hydrodynamics and check the asymptotic causality of the theory. A truncation scheme of the Israel-Stewart formalism derived in our earlier work is proposed that extends the minimal causal formulation. It consists of altogether 40 interconnected relaxation-type dynamical equations -- 16 (24) of them correspond to the independent components of the energy-momentum (spin) tensor. Similarly to previous studies, we find that the stability of the perturbations and asymptotic causality require using the spin equation of state that satisfies the generalized Frenkel condition demanding that the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components of the spin density tensor have opposite signs. For low-momentum modes this behavior is similar to that found earlier for the first-order (Navier-Stokes) spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>$U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking quark interactions from vacuum polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering the one loop background field method for a quark-antiquark interaction, mediated by one (non perturbative) gluon exchange, sixth order quark effective interactions are derived and investigated in the limit of zero momentum transfer for large quark and/or gluon effective masses. They extend fourth order quark interactions worked out in previous works of the author. These interactions break $U_A(1)$ symmetry and may be either momentum independent or dependent. Part of these interactions vanish in the limit of massless quarks, and several other - involving vector and/or axial quark currents - survive. In the local limit of the resulting interactions, some phenomenological implications are presented, which correspond to corrections to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. By means of the auxiliary field method, the local interactions give rise to three meson interactions whose values are compared to phenomenological values found in the literature. Contributions for meson-mixing parameters are calculated and compared to available results.</description>
