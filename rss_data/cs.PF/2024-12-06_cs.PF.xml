      <title>PriorMotion: Generative Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Raster-Vector Motion Field Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable perception of spatial and motion information is crucial for safe autonomous navigation. Traditional approaches typically fall into two categories: object-centric and class-agnostic methods. While object-centric methods often struggle with missed detections, leading to inaccuracies in motion prediction, many class-agnostic methods focus heavily on encoder design, often overlooking important priors like rigidity and temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance, particularly with sparse LiDAR data at distant region. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{PriorMotion}$, a generative framework that extracts rasterized and vectorized scene representations to model spatio-temporal priors. Our model comprises a BEV encoder, an Raster-Vector prior Encoder, and a Spatio-Temporal prior Generator, improving both spatial and temporal consistency in motion prediction. Additionally, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol for class-agnostic motion prediction. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that PriorMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with further validation on advanced FMCW LiDAR confirming its robustness.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the Theory of Performance-Based Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.</description>

      <title>The Tile: A 2D Map of Ranking Scores for Two-Class Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the computer vision and machine learning communities, as well as in many other research domains, rigorous evaluation of any new method, including classifiers, is essential. One key component of the evaluation process is the ability to compare and rank methods. However, ranking classifiers and accurately comparing their performances, especially when taking application-specific preferences into account, remains challenging. For instance, commonly used evaluation tools like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision/Recall (PR) spaces display performances based on two scores. Hence, they are inherently limited in their ability to compare classifiers across a broader range of scores and lack the capability to establish a clear ranking among classifiers. In this paper, we present a novel versatile tool, named the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores in a single 2D map for two-class classifiers, including common evaluation scores such as the accuracy, the true positive rate, the positive predictive value, Jaccard's coefficient, and all F-beta scores. Furthermore, we study the properties of the underlying ranking scores, such as the influence of the priors or the correspondences with the ROC space, and depict how to characterize any other score by comparing them to the Tile. Overall, we demonstrate that the Tile is a powerful tool that effectively captures all the rankings in a single visualization and allows interpreting them.</description>

      <title>A Hitchhiker's Guide to Understanding Performances of Two-Class Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properly understanding the performances of classifiers is essential in various scenarios. However, the literature often relies only on one or two standard scores to compare classifiers, which fails to capture the nuances of application-specific requirements, potentially leading to suboptimal classifier selection. Recently, a paper on the foundations of the theory of performance-based ranking introduced a tool, called the Tile, that organizes an infinity of ranking scores into a 2D map. Thanks to the Tile, it is now possible to evaluate and compare classifiers efficiently, displaying all possible application-specific preferences instead of having to rely on a pair of scores. In this paper, we provide a first hitchhiker's guide for understanding the performances of two-class classifiers by presenting four scenarios, each showcasing a different user profile: a theoretical analyst, a method designer, a benchmarker, and an application developer. Particularly, we show that we can provide different interpretative flavors that are adapted to the user's needs by mapping different values on the Tile. As an illustration, we leverage the newly introduced Tile tool and the different flavors to rank and analyze the performances of 74 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models in two-class classification through the eyes of the four user profiles. Through these user profiles, we demonstrate that the Tile effectively captures the behavior of classifiers in a single visualization, while accommodating an infinite number of ranking scores.</description>
