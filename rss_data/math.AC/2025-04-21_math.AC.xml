      <title>Monomial retracts of polynomial rings are polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring and $B = R[X_1, \dots, X_n]$ the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over $R$. In this article, we consider retractions $\varphi : B \longrightarrow B$ such that $\varphi(X_i)$ is either a monic monomial or $0$. We prove that if $R$ is an integral domain, then any such retract is isomorphic to $R^{[p]}$, the polynomial ring in $p$ variables over $R$, for some $0 \le p \le n$. We also characterize different monomial retractions of $B$ which give the same retract.</description>

      <title>On robust toric ideals of weighted oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the equivalence of robustness, strongly robustness, generalized robustness, and weakly robustness properties of toric ideals of weighted oriented graphs. For any weighted oriented graph $D$, if its toric ideal $I_D$ is generalized robust or weakly robust, then we show that $D$ has no subgraphs of certain structures.
  We prove the equality of Graver basis, Universal Gr\"obner basis, reduced Gr\"obner basis with respect to degree lexicographic order of the toric ideals $I_D$ of weighted oriented graphs $D=\C_1\cup_P \cdots \cup_P \C_n$ consist of cycles $\C_1\ldots,\C_n$ that share a path $P$. As a consequence, we show that (i) $I_{D}$ is robust iff $I_{D}$ is strongly robust; (ii) $I_{D}$ is generalized robust iff $I_{D}$ is weakly robust. If at most two of the cycles $\C_i$ in $D$ are unbalanced, then the following statements are equivalent: (i) $I_{D}$ is strongly robust; (ii) $I_{D}$ is robust; (iii) $I_{D}$ is generalized robust; (iv) $I_{D}$ is weakly robust; (v) $D$ has no subgraphs of types $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$, where $D_1$ is a weighted oriented graph consisting of two balanced cycles share an edge in $D$, and $D_2$ is a weighted oriented graph consisting of three cycles that share an edge\ such that one cycle is balanced and the rest two are unbalanced cycles, as in figure \ref{fig2}. We explicitly determine the Graver basis of the toric ideal of two balanced cycles sharing a path.</description>

      <title>On Extension modules of finite homological dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the implications of the finiteness of homological dimensions for Ext modules, focusing on projective dimension, injective dimension, and their Gorenstein counterpart. In this direction, we establish several finiteness criteria for homological dimensions. Our results include the consequences of the finiteness of the Gorenstein (injective) dimension of the deficiency modules as well as a duality for certain Ext modules, all of finite (Gorenstein) projective dimension.</description>

      <title>Tame arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tame arrangements were informally introduced by Orlik and Terao for the study of Milnor fibers of hyperplane arrangements. After that, tame arrangements have been applied to a lot of researches on arrangements including freeness, master functions and critical varieties, Solomon-Terao algebras, D-modules, Bernstein-Sato polynomials and likelihood geometry. Though arrangements are generically tame, the research on tame arrangements themselves have been only few. In this article we establish foundations for the research of tame arrangements. Namely, we prove the addition theorem for tame arrangements, Ziegler-Yoshinaga type results for tameness and combinatorially determined tameness.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of powers of ideals in dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of powers of an ideal in a local ring. In dimension two, we provide answers to some problems raised by Smirnov, and give a criterion to answer one of his questions in terms of a "Ratliff-Rush version" of the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic regularity of graded family of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the asymptotic regularity of a graded family $(I_n)_{n \ge 0}$ of homogeneous ideals in a reduced standard graded algebra, i.e., the limit $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \text{reg } I_n/n$, exists in several cases; for example, when the family $(I_n)_{n \ge 0}$ consists of artinian ideals, or Cohen-Macaulay ideals of the same codimension over an uncountable base field of characteristic $0$, or when its Rees algebra is Noetherian. Many applications, including simplifications and generalizations of previously known results on symbolic powers and integral closures of powers of homogeneous ideals, are discussed. We provide a combinatorial interpretation of the limit $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \text{reg } I_n/n$ in terms of the associated Newton--Okounkov region in various situations. We give a negative answer to the question of whether the limits $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \text{reg } (I_1^n + \dots + I_p^n)/n$ and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \text{reg } (I_1^n \cap \cdots \cap I_p^n)/n$ exist, for $p \ge 2$ and homogeneous ideals $I_1, \dots, I_p$. We also examine ample evidence supporting a negative answer to the question of whether the asymptotic regularity of the family of symbolic powers of a homogeneous ideal always exists. Our work presents explicit Gr\"obner basis construction for ideals of the form $Q^n + (f^k)$, where $Q$ is a monomial ideal, $f$ is a polynomial in the polynomial ring in 4 variables over a field of characteristic $2$.</description>

      <title>On GL-domains and the ascent of the IDF property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the terminology introduced by Arnold and Sheldon back in 1975, we say that an integral domain $D$ is a GL-domain if the product of any two primitive polynomials over $D$ is again a primitive polynomial. In this paper, we study the class of GL-domains. First, we propose a characterization of GL-domain in terms of certain elements we call prime-like. Then we identify a new class of GL-domains. An integral domain $D$ is also said to have the IDF property provided that each nonzero element of $D$ is divisible by only finitely many non-associate irreducible divisors. It was proved by Malcolmson and Okoh in 2009 that the IDF property ascends to polynomial extensions when restricted to the class of GCD-domains. This result was recently strengthened by Gotti and Zafrullah to the class of PSP-domains. We conclude this paper by proving that the IDF property does not ascend to polynomial extensions in the class of GL-domains, answering an open question posed by Gotti and Zafrullah.</description>

      <title>On vanishing of higher direct images of the structure sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the vanishing of the first direct image of the structure sheaf of a normal scheme $X$ which is mapped properly and birationally over a regular scheme of any dimension. On the other hand, for any dimension greater than two, we show examples of a proper birational morphism from a normal and Cohen-Macaulay scheme to a regular scheme such that the second direct image does not vanish and has an isolated support.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Scheme of a Pair of Skew Lines on Cubic Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an irreducible component H(X) of the Hilbert scheme Hilb^{2t+2}(X) of a smooth cubic hypersurface X containing two disjoint lines. For cubic threefolds, H(X) is always smooth, as shown in arXiv:2010.11622. We provide a second proof and generalize this result to higher dimensions. Specifically, for cubic hypersurfaces of dimension at least four, we show H(X) is normal, and it is smooth if and only if X lacks certain "higher triple lines." We characterize H(X) using the Hilbert-Chow morphism and describe its singularities when X is special.</description>

      <title>A universal characteristic class for vector bundles with a connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper I introduce a new characteristic class $c(E)$ for a finite rank vector bundle $E$ on an affine scheme $S:=Spec(A)$ - the fundamental class of $E$. The class $c(E)$ is not a characteristic class in the classical sense in the sense that it lives in a pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$. Most characteristic classes lives in a cohomology group. The pointed cohomology torsor $\operatorname{Ext}^1(L, \operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is a torsor on the abelian group $\operatorname{H}^2(L, Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E)))$ where $Z(\operatorname{End}_A(E))$ is the center of the ring of endomorphisms of $E$ and where the cohomology is the Lie-Rinehart cohomology of the center. The class $c(E)$ is trivial if and only if $E$ has a flat algebraic connection. Hence the class $c(T_S)$ where $T_S$ is the tangent bundle, is an an obstruction for $S$ to be algebraically parallelizable. I use a connection $\nabla$ to define $c(E)$ and I also prove the class $c(E)$ is independent of choice of connection, hence $c(E)$ is an invariant of the vector bundle $E$. The class generalize the Chern class, the Pontryagin class, the Euler class and the Teleman characteristic class. I prove using an explicit example that the class $c(E)$ is stronger than the Chern class and the Euler class. I also give a new proof of a formula for the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ in terms of an idempotent endomorphism $\phi$ defining $E$. This formula was claimed and proved in a paper put out on the arXiv in 2011, and in this paper I give a new proof that is easier to read. The class may be interesting in the study of the "cancellation problem" in affine algebraic geometry and the problem of giving algebraic formulas for the topological Euler characteristic. I also calculate the algebraic deRham cohomology of the complex two sphere and prove it is infinite dimensional.</description>
