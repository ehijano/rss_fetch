      <title>Scaling mean annual peak flow scaling with upstream basin area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how annual peak flow, $Q_p$, relates to upstream basin area, $A$, and their scaling have been one of the challenges in surface hydrology. Although a power-law scaling relationship (i.e., $Q_p \propto A^\alpha$) has been widely applied in the literature, it is purely empirical, and due to its empiricism the interpretation of its exponent, a, and its variations from one basin to another is not clear. In the literature, different values of a have been reported for various datasets and drainage basins of different areas. Invoking concepts of percolation theory as well as self-affinity, we derived universal and non-universal scaling laws to theoretically link $Q_p$ to $A$. In the universal scaling, we related the exponent $\alpha$ to the fractal dimensionality of percolation, $D_x$. In the non-universal scaling, in addition to $D_x$, the exponent a was related to the Hurst exponent, $H$, characterizing the boundaries of the drainage basin. The $D_x$ depends on the dimensionality of the drainage system (e.g., two or three dimensions) and percolation class (e.g., random or invasion percolation). We demonstrated that the theoretical universal and non-universal bounds were in well agreement with experimental ranges of a reported in the literature. More importantly, our theoretical framework revealed that greater a values are theoretically expected when basins are more quasi two-dimensional, while smaller values when basins are mainly quasi three-dimensional. This is well consistent with the experimental data. We attributed it to the fact that small basins most probably display quasi-two-dimensional topography, while large basins quasi-three-dimensional one.</description>

      <title>Negative large deviations of the front velocity of $N$-particle branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study negative large deviations of the long-time empirical front velocity in the one-sided $N$-BBM ($N$-particle branching Brownian motion) model in one dimension. Employing the macroscopic fluctuation theory, we evaluate the probability density that the front velocity $c$ is smaller than the limiting velocity $c_0$, predicted by the deterministic theory. We show that for $c_0-c\ll c_0$ the corresponding rate function $s(c)$ coincides, up to a numerical factor, with the similar rate functions for other front models belonging to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Piscounov universality class. For large negative values of $c$, $s(c)$ approaches a simple bound, obtained under the assumption that the branching is completely suppressed during the whole time.</description>

      <title>Transport in open quantum systems in presence of lossy channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) transport in a boundary driven one-dimensional fermionic lattice setup which is further subjected to particle loss. We analyze the system size scaling of conductance at zero temperature for different values of the chemical potential of the boundary reservoirs. We consider a variety of loss channel configurations: (i) single loss at the middle site of the lattice, (ii) multiple but nonextensive lossy channels, and (iii) extensive lossy channels. For the cases (i) and (ii), the conductance scaling with system size remains robust (i.e., same as the case with no loss) for chemical potential within and outside the lattice band, while at the band-edge rich anomalous conductance scaling emerges. For case (iii), the conductance scaling becomes ballistic in the thermodynamic limit for any value of chemical potential. We explain the emergence of these different system size scalings of conductance by analyzing the spectral properties of the associated non-hermitian transfer matrices of the underlying lattice. We demonstrate that the emergence of anomalous scaling is deeply connected to the existence of exceptional points of transfer matrices. Our study unravels that by carefully optimizing the loss mechanism configurations, one can in principle realize systems with rich transport properties in low-dimensional open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Relaxation dynamics in the (double) sine-Gordon model -- an open-system viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and criticality of supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamics and criticality properties of four families of su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains of Haldane-Shastry (HS) type, related to both the $A_{N-1}$ and the $BC_N$ classical root systems. Using a known formula expressing the thermodynamic free energy per spin of these models in terms of the Perron (largest in modulus) eigenvalue of a suitable inhomogeneous transfer matrix, we prove a general result relating the su$(kp|kq)$ free energy with arbitrary $k=1,2,\dots$ to the su$(p|q)$ free energy. In this way we are able to evaluate the thermodynamic free energy per spin of several infinite families of supersymmetric HS-type chains, and study their thermodynamics. In particular, we show that in all cases the specific heat at constant volume features a single marked Schottky peak, which in some cases can be heuristically explained by approximating the model with a suitable multi-level system with equally spaced energies. We also study the critical behavior of the models under consideration, showing that the low-temperature behavior of their thermodynamic free energy per spin is the same as that of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory with central charge $c=m+n/2-1$. However, using a motif-based description of the spectrum we prove that only the three families of su$(1|n)$ chains of type $A_{N-1}$ and the su$(m|n)$ HS chain of $BC_N$ type with $m=1,2,3$ (when the sign $\varepsilon_B$ in the Hamiltonian takes the value $-1$ in the latter case) are truly critical.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties, localization transition and multifractal eigenvectors of the Laplacian on heterogeneous networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and eigenvector statistics of the Laplacian on highly-connected networks with random coupling strengths and a gamma distribution of rescaled degrees. The spectral density, the distribution of the local density of states, the singularity spectrum and the multifractal exponents of this model exhibit a rich behaviour as a function of the first two moments of the coupling strengths and the variance of the rescaled degrees. In the case of random coupling strengths, the spectral density diverges within the bulk of the spectrum when degree fluctuations are strong enough. The emergence of this singular behaviour marks a transition from non-ergodic delocalized states to localized eigenvectors that exhibit pronounced multifractal scaling. For constant coupling strengths, the bulk of the spectrum is characterized by a regular spectral density. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors display localization properties reminiscent of the critical point of the Anderson localization transition on random graphs.</description>

      <title>Operational work fluctuation theorem for open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Jarzynski equality establishes an exact relation between the stochastic work performed on a system driven out of thermal equilibrium and the free energy difference in a corresponding quasi-static process. This fluctuation theorem bears experimental relevance, as it enables the determination of the free energy difference through the measurement of externally applied work in a nonequilibrium process. In the quantum case, the Jarzynski equality only holds if the measurement procedure of the stochastic work is drastically changed: it is replaced by a so-called two-point measurement (TPM) scheme that requires the knowledge of the initial and final Hamiltonian and therefore lacks the predictive power for the free energy difference that the classical Jarzynski equation is known for. Here, we propose a quantum {{fluctuation theorem}} that is valid for externally measurable quantum work determined during the driving protocol. In contrast to the TPM case, the theorem also applies to open quantum systems and the scenario can be realized without knowing the system Hamiltonian. Our fluctuation theorem comes in the form of an inequality and therefore only yields bounds to the true free energy difference. The inequality is saturated in the quasiclassical case of vanishing energy coherences at the beginning and at the end of the protocol. Thus, there is a clear quantum disadvantage.</description>

      <title>Diffusing Wave Microrheology in Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in determining the viscoelastic properties of polymeric liquids and other complex fluids by means of Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS). In this technique, light-scattering spectroscopy is applied to highly turbid fluids containing optical probe particles. The DWS spectrum is used to infer the time-dependent mean-square displacement and time-dependent diffusion coefficient $D$ of the probes. From $D$, values for the storage modulus $G'(\omega)$ and the loss modulus $G''(\omega)$ are obtained. This paper is primarily concerned with the inference of the mean-square displacement from a DWS spectrum. However, in much of the literature, central to the inference that is said to yield $D$ is an invocation $g^{(1)}(t) = \exp(- 2 q^{2} \overline{X(t)^{2}})$ of the Gaussian Approximation for the field correlation function $g^{(1)}(t)$ of the scattered light in terms of the mean-square displacement $\overline{X(t)^{2}}$ of a probe particle during time $t$. Experiment and simulation both show that the Gaussian approximation is invalid for probes in polymeric liquids and other complex fluids. In this paper, we obtain corrections to the Gaussian approximation that will assist in interpreting DWS spectra of probes in polymeric liquids. The corrections reveal that these DWS spectra receive contributions from higher moments $\overline{X(t)^{2n}}$, $n &gt;1$, of the probe displacement distribution function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit forming an approximate t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work is the continuation of our paper [1]. It is devoted to the modeling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modeling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schl\"ogl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from [1], we consider here the memory effects, i.e. the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.</description>

      <title>Magnetization oscillations in a periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the magnetization in an Ising chain subjected to a slowly rotating transverse field. The magnetization oscillations are found to be explained by the contributions from different particle excitations in the quantum $E_8$ model. We study the magnetization in the frequency domain in detail, uncovering a series of singular peaks for the $z$ (Ising) component. These singular peaks are split into two sets for the magnetization along $x$ and $y$ directions with frequency shifts set by the rotational-field frequency. The peaks include both $\delta$-function type and edge-singularity type peaks. The $\delta$-function peaks can be attributed to particle excitations involving an $E_8$ particle with either the vacuum or a different particle. The edge-singularity peaks are contributed by particle excitations of two $E_8$ particles with either the vacuum or another particle, or by particle excitations that contain two sets of two particles with each set including at least a particle of the same type. We propose a Rydberg qubit array for possible experimental investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Avalanche is believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on long disordered spin chains. In addition to the PXP model, we construct models by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach longer system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. Avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Exact diagonalization results are compared with other studies using the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits that contain only gates respecting a symmetry. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on the set of realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. Generically, such constraints include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while in the case of Z_2, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries, 2-qubit gates are semi-universal on qubit systems, in the case of SU(d) symmetry with d\ge 3, semi-universality can be achieved only with 3-qudit gates. The failure of semi-universality implies that the distribution generated by the circuit is not even a 2-design for the Haar (uniform) distribution over the group of all unitaries respecting the symmetry. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions on the gate set, which hold, e.g., in the case of U(1) and SU(2), the distribution of unitaries generated by the random circuit becomes a t-design for t growing polynomially with the number of qudits with a degree that is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum value of the integer t, for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a t-design, and solve this equation for various examples.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain far from equilibrium: single-file diffusion, long-range order, and hyperuniformity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In one dimension, particles can not bypass each other. As a consequence, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) in equilibrium shows sub-diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2}$, instead of normal diffusion ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t$. This phenomenon is the so-called single-file diffusion. Here, we investigate how the above equilibrium behaviors are modified far from equilibrium. In particular, we want to uncover what kind of non-equilibrium driving force can suppress diffusion and achieve the long-range crystalline order in one dimension, which is prohibited by the Mermin-Wagner theorem in equilibrium. For that purpose, we investigate the harmonic chain driven by the following four types of driving forces that do not satisfy the detailed balance: (i) temporally correlated noise with the noise spectrum $D(\omega)\sim \omega^{-2\theta}$, (ii) conserving noise, (iii) periodic driving force, and (iv) periodic deformations of particles. For the driving force (i) with $\theta&gt;-1/4$, we observe ${\rm MSD}(t)\sim t^{1/2+2\theta}$ for large $t$. On the other hand, for the driving forces (i) with $\theta&lt;-1/4$ and (ii)-(iv), MSD remains finite. As a consequence, the harmonic chain exhibits the crystalline order even in one dimension. Furthermore, the density fluctuations of the model are highly suppressed in a large scale in the crystal phase. This phenomenon is known as hyperuniformity. We discuss that hyperuniformity of the noise fluctuations themselves is the relevant mechanism to stabilize the long-range crystalline order in one dimension and yield hyperuniformity of the density fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the non-linear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that connects thermodynamic dissipation to replicator per-capita decay and growth rates. We argue from basic thermodynamic principles against this interpretation. In fact, we suggest that such a relationship cannot exist in principle, because it is impossible for a thermodynamically-consistent replicator to undergo both per-capita growth and per-capita decay back into reactants. On the other hand, a replicator may undergo per-capita decay into separate waste products, but in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship that connects their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the heat capacity for steady periodically driven systems and as an example we compute it for dissipative two-level systems where the energy gap is time-modulated. There, as a function of ambient temperature, the Schottky peak remains the dominant feature. Yet, in contrast with equilibrium, the quasistatic thermal response of a nonequilibrium system also reveals kinetic information present in the transition rates; e.g., the heat capacity depends on the time-symmetric reactivities and changes by the presence of a kinetic barrier. It still vanishes though at absolute zero, in accord with an extended Nernst heat postulate, but at a different rate from the equilibrium case. More generally, we discuss the dependence on driving frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted planar stochastic (WPS) lattice introduces a topological disorder that emerges from a multifractal structure. Its dual network has a power-law degree distribution and is embedded in a two-dimensional space, forming a planar network. We modify the original recipe to construct WPS networks with degree distributions interpolating smoothly between the original power-law tail, $P(q)\sim q^{-\alpha}$ with exponent $\alpha\approx 5.6$, and a square lattice. We analyze the role of disorder in the modified WPS model, considering the critical behavior of the contact process. We report a critical scaling depending on the network degree distribution. The scaling exponents differ from the standard mean-field behavior reported for CP on infinite-dimensional (random) graphs with power-law degree distribution. Furthermore, the disorder present in the WPS lattice model is in agreement with the Luck-Harris criterion for the relevance of disorder in critical dynamics. However, despite the same wandering exponent $\omega=1/2$, the disorder effects observed for the WPS lattice are weaker than those found for uncorrelated disorder.</description>

      <title>General theory for extended-range percolation on simple and multiplex networks</title>

Abstract: Extended-range percolation is a robust percolation process that has relevance for quantum communication problems. In extended-range percolation nodes can be trusted or untrusted. Untrusted facilitator nodes are untrusted nodes that can still allow communication between trusted nodes if they lie on a path of distance at most R between two trusted nodes. In extended-range percolation the extended-range giant component (ERGC) includes trusted nodes connected by paths of trusted and untrusted facilitator nodes. Here, based on a message passing algorithm, we develop a general theory of extended-range percolation, valid for arbitrary values of R as long as the networks are locally tree-like. This general framework allows us to investigate the properties of extended-range percolation on interdependent multiplex networks. While the extended-range nature makes multiplex networks more robust, interdependency makes them more fragile. From the interplay between these two effects a rich phase diagram merges including discontinuous phase transitions and reentrant phases. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed exactly solvable model constitutes a fundamental reference for the study of models defined through properties of extended-range paths.</description>

      <title>A theorem on extensive ground state entropy, spin liquidity and some related models</title>

Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine ``applying'' the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $\frac{h}{J} = \frac{J_z}{J_x}$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature and an extensive ground state entropy. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually \guillemotleft anticommuting\guillemotright $\;$ sets of $local$ conserved quantities for $H$. Such a structure will be shown to be not unnatural in the class of bond-dependent Hamiltonians. In the above quantum Ising model inspired example of $H$, this is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed. Thus this is more general and forms the basis for an exact statement on the existence of extensive ground state entropy in any dimension. Furthermore this structure can be used to prove spin liquidity non-perturbatively in the ground state manifold. Higher-dimensional quantum spin liquid constructions based on this are given which are conjectured to evade a quasiparticle description.</description>

      <title>Fluids with power-law repulsion: Hyperuniformity and energy fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a classical fluid of point-like particles with repulsive power-law pair interactions, focusing on density and energy fluctuations at finite temperature. Such long-range interactions, decaying with inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^s$ in $d$ dimensions, are known to fall into two qualitatively different categories. For $s&lt;d$ ("strongly" long-range interactions) there are screening of correlations and suppression of large-wavelength density fluctuations (hyperuniformity). These effects eliminate density modes with arbitrarily large energy. For $s&gt;d$ ("weakly" long-range interactions) screening and hyperuniformity do not occur. Using scaling arguments, variational analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, we find another qualitative distinction. For $s\geq d/2$ the strong repulsion at short distances leads to enhanced small-wavelength density fluctuations, decorrelating particle positions. This prevents indefinitely negative entropy and large energy fluctuations. The distinct behaviors for $s\geq d/2$ and $s&lt;d/2$ give rise to qualitatively different dependencies of the entropy, heat capacity, and energy fluctuations on temperature and density. We investigate the effect of introducing an upper cutoff distance in the pair-potential. The effect of the cutoff on energy fluctuations is strong for $s&lt;d/2$ and negligible for $s\geq d/2$.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the three-dimensional subsystem toric code</title>

Abstract: Subsystem quantum error-correcting codes typically involve measuring a sequence of non-commuting parity check operators. They can sometimes exhibit greater fault-tolerance than conventional subspace codes, which use commuting checks. However, unlike subspace codes, it is unclear if subsystem codes -- in particular their advantages -- can be understood in terms of ground state properties of a physical Hamiltonian. In this paper, we address this question for the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC), as recently constructed by Kubica and Vasmer [Nat. Comm. 13, 6272(2022)], which exhibits single-shot error correction (SSEC). Motivated by a conjectured relation between SSEC and thermal stability, we study the zero and finite temperature phases of an associated non-commuting Hamiltonian. By mapping the Hamiltonian model to a pair of 3D Z_2 gauge theories coupled by a kinetic constraint, we find various phases at zero temperature, all separated by first-order transitions: there are 3D toric code-like phases with deconfined point-like excitations in the bulk, and there are phases with a confined bulk supporting a 2D toric code on the surface when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen. The latter is similar to the surface topological order present in 3D STC. However, the similarities between the SSEC in 3D STC and the confined phases are only partial: they share the same sets of degrees of freedom, but they are governed by different dynamical rules. Instead, we argue that the process of SSEC can more suitably be associated with a path (rather than a point) in the zero-temperature phase diagram, a perspective which inspires alternative measurement sequences enabling SSEC. Moreover, since none of the above-mentioned phases survives at nonzero temperature, SSEC of the code does not imply thermal stability of the associated Hamiltonian phase.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between measurement-induced dynamics and conditional unitary evolution in quantum systems. We numerically and analytically investigate commuting random measurement and feedforward (MFF) processes, and find a sharp transition in their ability to generate entanglement negativity as the number of MFF channels varies. We also establish a direct connection between these findings and transitions induced by random dephasing from an environment with broken time-reversal symmetry. In one variant of the problem, we employ free probability theory to rigorously prove the transition's existence. Furthermore, these MFF processes have dynamic circuit representations that can be experimentally explored on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Monte Carlo Approximations to the Distribution of the First Passage Time of the Drifted Diffusion with Stochastic Resetting and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces two techniques for computing the distribution of the absorption or first passage time of the drifted Wiener diffusion subject to Poisson resetting times, to an upper hard wall barrier and to a lower absorbing barrier. The first method, which we call ``Pad\'e-partial fraction'' approximation, starts with the Pad\'e approximation to the Laplace transform of the first passage time distribution, which is then exactly inverted by means of the partial fraction decomposition. The second method, which we call "multiresolution algorithm", is a Monte Carlo technique that exploits the properties of the Wiener process in order to generate Brownian bridges at increasing levels of resolution. Our numerical study reveals that the multiresolution algorithm has higher efficiency than standard Monte Carlo, whereas the faster Pad\'e-partial fraction method is accurate in various circumstances and provides an analytical formula. Also, a closed-form exact expression for the expected first passage time is derived.</description>

Abstract: We present the mean field solution of the quantum and classical Heisenberg spin glasses, using the combination of a high precision numerical solution of the Parisi full replica symmetry breaking equations and a continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo. We characterize the spin glass order and its low-energy excitations down to zero temperature. The Heisenberg spin glass has a rougher energy landscape than its Ising analogue, and exhibits a very slow temperature evolution of its dynamical properties. We extend our analysis to the doped, metallic Heisenberg spin glass, which displays an unexpectedly slow spin dynamics reflecting the proximity to the melting quantum critical point and its associated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Planckian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac Distribution in Persistent Current Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: (i) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; (ii) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the U(1) lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Plaquette Models, Cellular Automata, and Measurement-induced Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a class of two-dimensional randomized plaquette models, where the multi-spin interaction term, referred to as the plaquette term, is replaced by a single-site spin term with a probability of $1-p$. By varying $p$, we observe a ground state phase transition, or equivalently, a phase transition of the symmetry operator. We find that as we vary $p$, the symmetry operator changes from being extensive to being localized in space. These models can be equivalently understood as 1+1D randomized cellular automaton dynamics, allowing the 2D transition to be interpreted as a 1+1D dynamical absorbing phase transition. In this paper, our primary focus is on the plaquette term with three or five-body interactions, where we explore the universality classes of the transitions. Specifically, for the model with five-body interaction, we demonstrate that it belongs to the same universality class as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition observed in 1+1D Clifford dynamics, as well as the boundary entanglement transition of the 2D cluster state induced by random bulk Pauli measurements. This work establishes a connection between transitions in classical spin models, cellular automata, and hybrid random circuits.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory suggests, on geometric grounds and with a physically-reasoned assumption that the excluded-volume size of neutrons is 20\% larger than that of protons, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$. This new ``geometric'' random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Solution of some tiling open problems of Propp, Lai, and some related results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>
