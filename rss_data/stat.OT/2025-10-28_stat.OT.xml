      <title>Regularization method in the variable selection for logistic regression on BRFSS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, yet effective prediction of stroke risk using large-scale population data remains challenging due to data imbalance and high-dimensional features. In this study, we develop and evaluate regularized logistic regression models for stroke prediction using data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), comprising 445132 U.S. adult respondents and 328 health-related variables. To address data imbalance, we apply several resampling techniques including oversampling, undersampling, class weighting, and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). We further employ Lasso, Elastic Net, and Group Lasso regularization methods to perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Model performance is assessed using ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. Among all methods, the Lasso-based model achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.761), while the Group Lasso method identified a compact set of key predictors: Age, Heart Disease, Physical Health, and Dental Health. These findings demonstrate the potential of regularized regression techniques for interpretable and efficient prediction of stroke risk from large-scale behavioral health data.</description>

      <title>Change, dependence, and discovery: Celebrating the work of T.L. Lai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tze Leung Lai made seminal contributions to sequential analysis, particularly in sequential hypothesis testing, changepoint detection and nonlinear renewal theory. His work established fundamental optimality results for the sequential probability ratio test and its extensions, and provided a general framework for testing composite hypotheses. In changepoint detection, he introduced new optimality criteria and computationally efficient procedures that remain influential. He applied these and related tools to problems in biostatistics. In this article, we review these key results in the broader context of sequential analysis.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their roles within wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this interconnectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. In this work, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher levels of burglary, drug possession, robbery, shoplifting, and theft. For example, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population size constant. We demonstrate that models incorporating both population size and commuter inflows explain variation in these offenses better than population-only models. Our findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</description>
