      <title>MeshBrush: Painting the Anatomical Mesh with Neural Stylization for Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Style transfer is a promising approach to close the sim-to-real gap in medical endoscopy. Rendering realistic endoscopic videos by traversing pre-operative scans (such as MRI or CT) can generate realistic simulations as well as ground truth camera poses and depth maps. Although image-to-image (I2I) translation models such as CycleGAN perform well, they are unsuitable for video-to-video synthesis due to the lack of temporal consistency, resulting in artifacts between frames. We propose MeshBrush, a neural mesh stylization method to synthesize temporally consistent videos with differentiable rendering. MeshBrush uses the underlying geometry of patient imaging data while leveraging existing I2I methods. With learned per-vertex textures, the stylized mesh guarantees consistency while producing high-fidelity outputs. We demonstrate that mesh stylization is a promising approach for creating realistic simulations for downstream tasks such as training and preoperative planning. Although our method is tested and designed for ureteroscopy, its components are transferable to general endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures.</description>

      <title>Skeleton Recall Loss for Connectivity Conserving and Resource Efficient Segmentation of Thin Tubular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately segmenting thin tubular structures, such as vessels, nerves, roads or concrete cracks, is a crucial task in computer vision. Standard deep learning-based segmentation loss functions, such as Dice or Cross-Entropy, focus on volumetric overlap, often at the expense of preserving structural connectivity or topology. This can lead to segmentation errors that adversely affect downstream tasks, including flow calculation, navigation, and structural inspection. Although current topology-focused losses mark an improvement, they introduce significant computational and memory overheads. This is particularly relevant for 3D data, rendering these losses infeasible for larger volumes as well as increasingly important multi-class segmentation problems. To mitigate this, we propose a novel Skeleton Recall Loss, which effectively addresses these challenges by circumventing intensive GPU-based calculations with inexpensive CPU operations. It demonstrates overall superior performance to current state-of-the-art approaches on five public datasets for topology-preserving segmentation, while substantially reducing computational overheads by more than 90%. In doing so, we introduce the first multi-class capable loss function for thin structure segmentation, excelling in both efficiency and efficacy for topology-preservation.</description>

      <title>GaSpCT: Gaussian Splatting for Novel CT Projection View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GaSpCT, a novel view synthesis and 3D scene representation method used to generate novel projection views for Computer Tomography (CT) scans. We adapt the Gaussian Splatting framework to enable novel view synthesis in CT based on limited sets of 2D image projections and without the need for Structure from Motion (SfM) methodologies. Therefore, we reduce the total scanning duration and the amount of radiation dose the patient receives during the scan. We adapted the loss function to our use-case by encouraging a stronger background and foreground distinction using two sparsity promoting regularizers: a beta loss and a total variation (TV) loss. Finally, we initialize the Gaussian locations across the 3D space using a uniform prior distribution of where the brain's positioning would be expected to be within the field of view. We evaluate the performance of our model using brain CT scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset and demonstrate that the rendered novel views closely match the original projection views of the simulated scan, and have better performance than other implicit 3D scene representations methodologies. Furthermore, we empirically observe reduced training time compared to neural network based image synthesis for sparse-view CT image reconstruction. Finally, the memory requirements of the Gaussian Splatting representations are reduced by 17% compared to the equivalent voxel grid image representations.</description>

      <title>Classification of Nasopharyngeal Cases using DenseNet Deep Learning Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the understudied yet deadliest cancers in South East Asia. In Malaysia, the prevalence is identified mainly in Sarawak, among the ethnic of Bidayuh. NPC is often late-diagnosed because it is asymptomatic at the early stage. There are several tissue representations from the nasopharynx biopsy, such as nasopharyngeal inflammation (NPI), lymphoid hyperplasia (LHP), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and normal tissue. This paper is our first initiative to identify the difference between NPC, NPI and normal cases. Seven whole slide images (WSIs) with gigapixel resolutions from seven different patients and two hospitals were experimented with using two test setups, consisting of a different set of images. The tissue regions are patched into smaller blocks and classified using DenseNet architecture with 21 dense layers. Two tests are carried out, each for proof of concept (Test 1) and real-test scenario (Test 2). The accuracy achieved for NPC class is 94.8% for Test 1 and 67.0% for Test 2.</description>

      <title>CSR-dMRI: Continuous Super-Resolution of Diffusion MRI with Anatomical Structure-assisted Implicit Neural Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based dMRI super-resolution methods can effectively enhance image resolution by leveraging the learning capabilities of neural networks on large datasets. However, these methods tend to learn a fixed scale mapping between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images, overlooking the need for radiologists to scale the images at arbitrary resolutions. Moreover, the pixel-wise loss in the image domain tends to generate over-smoothed results, losing fine textures and edge information. To address these issues, we propose a novel continuous super-resolution of dMRI with anatomical structure-assisted implicit neural representation learning method, called CSR-dMRI. Specifically, the CSR-dMRI model consists of two components. The first is the latent feature extractor, which primarily extracts latent space feature maps from LR dMRI and anatomical images while learning structural prior information from the anatomical images. The second is the implicit function network, which utilizes voxel coordinates and latent feature vectors to generate voxel intensities at corresponding positions. Additionally, a frequency-domain-based loss is introduced to preserve the structural and texture information, further enhancing the image quality. Extensive experiments on the publicly available HCP dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our method demonstrates superior generalization capability and can be applied to arbitrary-scale super-resolution, including non-integer scale factors, expanding its applicability beyond conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>A dataset of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma MRI with multi-modalities segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging data with various sequences facilitate the early diagnosis, tumor segmentation, and disease staging in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The lack of publicly available, comprehensive datasets limits advancements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and the development of machine learning algorithms for NPC. Addressing this critical need, we introduce the first comprehensive NPC MRI dataset, encompassing MR axial imaging of 277 primary NPC patients. This dataset includes T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, totaling 831 scans. In addition to the corresponding clinical data, manually annotated and labeled segmentations by experienced radiologists offer high-quality data resources from untreated primary NPC.</description>

      <title>ChangeMamba: Remote Sensing Change Detection with Spatio-Temporal State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have made impressive progress in the field of remote sensing change detection (CD). However, both architectures have their inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on spatial state models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing change detection tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features and obtain accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.04% SeK; and on the xBD dataset, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score.

      <title>Segmentation-Guided Knee Radiograph Generation using Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image processing algorithms require representative data during development. In particular, surgical data might be difficult to obtain, and high-quality public datasets are limited. To overcome this limitation and augment datasets, a widely adopted solution is the generation of synthetic images. In this work, we employ conditional diffusion models to generate knee radiographs from contour and bone segmentations. Remarkably, two distinct strategies are presented by incorporating the segmentation as a condition into the sampling and training process, namely, conditional sampling and conditional training. The results demonstrate that both methods can generate realistic images while adhering to the conditioning segmentation. The conditional training method outperforms the conditional sampling method and the conventional U-Net.</description>

      <title>Towards Transcranial 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy of the Nonhuman Primate Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hemodynamic changes occur in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Developing imaging techniques allowing the in vivo visualization and quantification of cerebral blood flow would help better understand the underlying mechanism of those cerebrovascular diseases. 3D ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a novel technology that can map the microvasculature of the brain at large depth and has been mainly used until now in rodents. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of 3D ULM of the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain with a single 256-channels programmable ultrasound scanner. We achieved a highly resolved vascular map of the macaque brain at large depth in presence of craniotomy and durectomy using an 8-MHz multiplexed matrix probe. We were able to distinguish vessels as small as 26.9 {\mu}m. We also demonstrated that transcranial imaging of the macaque brain at similar depth was feasible using a 3-MHz probe and achieved a resolution of 60.4 {\mu}m. This work paves the way to clinical application of 3D ULM.</description>

      <title>DiffDet4SAR: Diffusion-based Aircraft Target Detection Network for SAR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aircraft target detection in SAR images is a challenging task due to the discrete scattering points and severe background clutter interference. Currently, methods with convolution-based or transformer-based paradigms cannot adequately address these issues. In this letter, we explore diffusion models for SAR image aircraft target detection for the first time and propose a novel \underline{Diff}usion-based aircraft target \underline{Det}ection network \underline{for} \underline{SAR} images (DiffDet4SAR). Specifically, the proposed DiffDet4SAR yields two main advantages for SAR aircraft target detection: 1) DiffDet4SAR maps the SAR aircraft target detection task to a denoising diffusion process of bounding boxes without heuristic anchor size selection, effectively enabling large variations in aircraft sizes to be accommodated; and 2) the dedicatedly designed Scattering Feature Enhancement (SFE) module further reduces the clutter intensity and enhances the target saliency during inference. Extensive experimental results on the SAR-AIRcraft-1.0 dataset show that the proposed DiffDet4SAR achieves 88.4\% mAP$_{50}$, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 6\%. Code is availabel at \href{https://github.com/JoyeZLearning/DiffDet4SAR}.</description>

      <title>HDR Imaging for Dynamic Scenes with Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) for real-world dynamic scenes is challenging because moving objects may lead to hybrid degradation of low dynamic range and motion blur. Existing event-based approaches only focus on a separate task, while cascading HDRI and motion deblurring would lead to sub-optimal solutions, and unavailable ground-truth sharp HDR images aggravate the predicament. To address these challenges, we propose an Event-based HDRI framework within a Self-supervised learning paradigm, i.e., Self-EHDRI, which generalizes HDRI performance in real-world dynamic scenarios. Specifically, a self-supervised learning strategy is carried out by learning cross-domain conversions from blurry LDR images to sharp LDR images, which enables sharp HDR images to be accessible in the intermediate process even though ground-truth sharp HDR images are missing. Then, we formulate the event-based HDRI and motion deblurring model and conduct a unified network to recover the intermediate sharp HDR results, where both the high dynamic range and high temporal resolution of events are leveraged simultaneously for compensation. We construct large-scale synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Self-EHDRI outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The codes, datasets, and results are available at https://lxp-whu.github.io/Self-EHDRI.</description>

      <title>Real-time Noise Source Estimation of a Camera System from an Image and Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous machines must self-maintain proper functionality to ensure the safety of humans and themselves. This pertains particularly to its cameras as predominant sensors to perceive the environment and support actions. A fundamental camera problem addressed in this study is noise. Solutions often focus on denoising images a posteriori, that is, fighting symptoms rather than root causes. However, tackling root causes requires identifying the noise sources, considering the limitations of mobile platforms. This work investigates a real-time, memory-efficient and reliable noise source estimator that combines data- and physically-based models. To this end, a DNN that examines an image with camera metadata for major camera noise sources is built and trained. In addition, it quantifies unexpected factors that impact image noise or metadata. This study investigates seven different estimators on six datasets that include synthetic noise, real-world noise from two camera systems, and real field campaigns. For these, only the model with most metadata is capable to accurately and robustly quantify all individual noise contributions. This method outperforms total image noise estimators and can be plug-and-play deployed. It also serves as a basis to include more advanced noise sources, or as part of an automatic countermeasure feedback-loop to approach fully reliable machines.</description>

      <title>AdaBM: On-the-Fly Adaptive Bit Mapping for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although image super-resolution (SR) problem has experienced unprecedented restoration accuracy with deep neural networks, it has yet limited versatile applications due to the substantial computational costs. Since different input images for SR face different restoration difficulties, adapting computational costs based on the input image, referred to as adaptive inference, has emerged as a promising solution to compress SR networks. Specifically, adapting the quantization bit-widths has successfully reduced the inference and memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy. However, despite the benefits of the resultant adaptive network, existing works rely on time-intensive quantization-aware training with full access to the original training pairs to learn the appropriate bit allocation policies, which limits its ubiquitous usage. To this end, we introduce the first on-the-fly adaptive quantization framework that accelerates the processing time from hours to seconds. We formulate the bit allocation problem with only two bit mapping modules: one to map the input image to the image-wise bit adaptation factor and one to obtain the layer-wise adaptation factors. These bit mappings are calibrated and fine-tuned using only a small number of calibration images. We achieve competitive performance with the previous adaptive quantization methods, while the processing time is accelerated by x2000. Codes are available at https://github.com/Cheeun/AdaBM.</description>

      <title>DI-Retinex: Digital-Imaging Retinex Theory for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many existing methods for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) based on Retinex theory ignore important factors that affect the validity of this theory in digital imaging, such as noise, quantization error, non-linearity, and dynamic range overflow. In this paper, we propose a new expression called Digital-Imaging Retinex theory (DI-Retinex) through theoretical and experimental analysis of Retinex theory in digital imaging. Our new expression includes an offset term in the enhancement model, which allows for pixel-wise brightness contrast adjustment with a non-linear mapping function. In addition, to solve the lowlight enhancement problem in an unsupervised manner, we propose an image-adaptive masked reverse degradation loss in Gamma space. We also design a variance suppression loss for regulating the additional offset term. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all existing unsupervised methods in terms of visual quality, model size, and speed. Our algorithm can also assist downstream face detectors in low-light, as it shows the most performance gain after the low-light enhancement compared to other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning applications for assessing medical images are limited because the datasets are often small and imbalanced. The use of synthetic data has been proposed in the literature, but neither a robust comparison of the different methods nor generalizability has been reported. Our approach integrates a retinal image quality assessment model and StyleGAN2 architecture to enhance Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) detection capabilities and improve generalizability. This work compares ten different Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures to generate synthetic eye-fundus images with and without AMD. We combined subsets of three public databases (iChallenge-AMD, ODIR-2019, and RIADD) to form a single training and test set. We employed the STARE dataset for external validation, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the proposed approach. The results show that StyleGAN2 reached the lowest Frechet Inception Distance (166.17), and clinicians could not accurately differentiate between real and synthetic images. ResNet-18 architecture obtained the best performance with 85% accuracy and outperformed the two human experts (80% and 75%) in detecting AMD fundus images. The accuracy rates were 82.8% for the test set and 81.3% for the STARE dataset, demonstrating the model's generalizability. The proposed methodology for synthetic medical image generation has been validated for robustness and accuracy, with free access to its code for further research and development in this field.</description>

      <title>Effective stripe artefact removal by a variational method: application to light-sheet microscopy, FIB-SEM and remote sensing images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14220</link>

Abstract: Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is used to capture volume images of biological specimens. It offers high contrast deep inside densely fluorescence labelled samples, fast acquisition speed and minimal harmful effects on the sample. However, LSFM images often show strong stripe artifacts originating from light-matter interactions. We propose a robust variational method suitable for removing stripes which outperforms existing methods and offers flexibility through two adjustable parameters. This tool is widely applicable to improve visual quality as well as facilitate downstream processing and analysis of images acquired on systems that do not provide hardware-based destriping methods. An evaluation of methods is performed on LSFM, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and remote sensing data, supplemented by synthetic LSFM images. The latter is obtained by simulating the imaging process on virtual samples.</description>

      <title>APISR: Anime Production Inspired Real-World Anime Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While real-world anime super-resolution (SR) has gained increasing attention in the SR community, existing methods still adopt techniques from the photorealistic domain. In this paper, we analyze the anime production workflow and rethink how to use characteristics of it for the sake of the real-world anime SR. First, we argue that video networks and datasets are not necessary for anime SR due to the repetition use of hand-drawing frames. Instead, we propose an anime image collection pipeline by choosing the least compressed and the most informative frames from the video sources. Based on this pipeline, we introduce the Anime Production-oriented Image (API) dataset. In addition, we identify two anime-specific challenges of distorted and faint hand-drawn lines and unwanted color artifacts. We address the first issue by introducing a prediction-oriented compression module in the image degradation model and a pseudo-ground truth preparation with enhanced hand-drawn lines. In addition, we introduce the balanced twin perceptual loss combining both anime and photorealistic high-level features to mitigate unwanted color artifacts and increase visual clarity. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on the public benchmark, showing our method outperforms state-of-the-art anime dataset-trained approaches.</description>

      <title>Vestibular schwannoma growth prediction from longitudinal MRI by time conditioned neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are benign tumors that are generally managed by active surveillance with MRI examination. To further assist clinical decision-making and avoid overtreatment, an accurate prediction of tumor growth based on longitudinal imaging is highly desirable. In this paper, we introduce DeepGrowth, a deep learning method that incorporates neural fields and recurrent neural networks for prospective tumor growth prediction. In the proposed method, each tumor is represented as a signed distance function (SDF) conditioned on a low-dimensional latent code. Unlike previous studies that perform tumor shape prediction directly in the image space, we predict the latent codes instead and then reconstruct future shapes from it. To deal with irregular time intervals, we introduce a time-conditioned recurrent module based on a ConvLSTM and a novel temporal encoding strategy, which enables the proposed model to output varying tumor shapes over time. The experiments on an in-house longitudinal VS dataset showed that the proposed model significantly improved the performance ($\ge 1.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge0.20$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance), in particular for top 20\% tumors that grow or shrink the most ($\ge 4.6\%$ Dice score and $\ge 0.73$ mm 95\% Hausdorff distance).

      <title>Weighted structure tensor total variation for image denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For image denoising problems, the structure tensor total variation (STV)-based models show good performances when compared with other competing regularization approaches. However, the STV regularizer does not couple the local information of the image and may not maintain the image details. Therefore, we employ the anisotropic weighted matrix introduced in the anisotropic total variation (ATV) model to improve the STV model. By applying the weighted matrix to the discrete gradient of the patch-based Jacobian operator in STV, our proposed weighted STV (WSTV) model can effectively capture local information from images and maintain their details during the denoising process. The optimization problem in the model is solved by a fast first-order gradient projection algorithm with a complexity result of $O(1 / i^2)$. For images with different Gaussian noise levels, the experimental results demonstrate that the WSTV model can effectively improve the quality of restored images compared to other TV and STV-based models.</description>

      <title>EventLFM: Event Camera integrated Fourier Light Field Microscopy for Ultrafast 3D imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast 3D imaging is indispensable for visualizing complex and dynamic biological processes. Conventional scanning-based techniques necessitate an inherent trade-off between acquisition speed and space-bandwidth product (SBP). Emerging single-shot 3D wide-field techniques offer a promising alternative but are bottlenecked by the synchronous readout constraints of conventional CMOS systems, thus restricting data throughput to maintain high SBP at limited frame rates. To address this, we introduce EventLFM, a straightforward and cost-effective system that overcomes these challenges by integrating an event camera with Fourier light field microscopy (LFM), a state-of-the-art single-shot 3D wide-field imaging technique. The event camera operates on a novel asynchronous readout architecture, thereby bypassing the frame rate limitations inherent to conventional CMOS systems. We further develop a simple and robust event-driven LFM reconstruction algorithm that can reliably reconstruct 3D dynamics from the unique spatiotemporal measurements captured by EventLFM. Experimental results demonstrate that EventLFM can robustly reconstruct fast-moving and rapidly blinking 3D fluorescent samples at kHz frame rates. Furthermore, we highlight EventLFM's capability for imaging of blinking neuronal signals in scattering mouse brain tissues and 3D tracking of GFP-labeled neurons in freely moving C. elegans. We believe that the combined ultrafast speed and large 3D SBP offered by EventLFM may open up new possibilities across many biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Temporally Consistent Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Action Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the action segmentation task for long, untrimmed videos, based on solving an optimal transport problem. By encoding a temporal consistency prior into a Gromov-Wasserstein problem, we are able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy affinity/matching cost matrix between video frames and action classes. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require knowing the action order for a video to attain temporal consistency. Furthermore, our resulting (fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem can be efficiently solved on GPUs using a few iterations of projected mirror descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an unsupervised learning setting, where our method is used to generate pseudo-labels for self-training. We evaluate our segmentation approach and unsupervised learning pipeline on the Breakfast, 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions and Desktop Assembly datasets, yielding state-of-the-art results for the unsupervised video action segmentation task.</description>
