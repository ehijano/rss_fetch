      <title>What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the population dynamics in OTC wholesale fresh product markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the combined evidences of bounded rationality, limited information and short-term optimization, over-the-counter (OTC) fresh product markets provide a perfect instance where to develop a behavioural approach to the analysis of micro-economic systems. Aiming at characterizing via a rigorous mathematical analysis, the main features of the spontaneous organization and functioning of such markets, we introduce and we study a stylized dynamical model for the time evolution of buyers populations and prices/attractiveness at each wholesaler. The dynamics is governed by immediate reactions of the actors to changes in basic indicators. Buyers are influenced by some degree of loyalty to their regular suppliers. Yet, at times, they also prospect for potential better offers. On the other hand, sellers primarily aim at maximising their profit. Yet, they can be also prone to improving their competitiveness in case of clientele deficit.
  Our results reveal that, in spite of being governed by simple and immediate rules, the competition between sellers self-regulates in time, as it constrains to bounded ranges the dispersion of both prices and clientele volumes, does similarly for the mean clientele volume, and it generates oscillatory behaviours that prevent any seller to dominate permanently its competitors (and to be dominated forever). Long-term behaviours are also investigated, with focus on asymptotic convergence to an equilibrium, as can be expected for a standard functioning mode. In particular, in the simplest case of 2 competing sellers, a normal-form-like analysis proves that such convergence holds, provided that the buyer's loyalty is sufficiently high or the sellers' reactivity is sufficiently low. In other words, this result identifies and proves those characteristics of the system that are responsible for long term stability and asymptotic damping of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Advanced Data Analysis of Spontaneous Biophoton Emission: A Multi-Method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) from living systems is widely hypothesized to reflect un-derlying self-organization and long-range coordination in biological dynamics. However, distin-guishing biologically driven correlations from trivial stochastic or instrumental effects requires a robust, multi-method framework. In this work, we establish and benchmark a comprehensive anal-ysis pipeline for photon-count time series, combining Distribution Entropy Analysis, R\'enyi entro-py, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, its generalization Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, and tail-statistics characterization. Surrogate signals constructed from Poisson processes, Fractional Gaussian Noise, and Renewal Processes with power-law waiting times are used to validate sensitivity to memory, intermittency, and multifractality. Across all methods, a coherent hierarchy of dynamical regimes is recovered, demonstrating internal methodological consistency. Application to experimental dark-count data and attenuated coherent-laser emission confirm Poisson-like behavior, establishing an essential statistical baseline for UPE studies. The combined results show that this multi-resolution approach reliably separates trivial photon-counting statistics from struc-tured long-range organization, providing a validated methodological foundation for future biological UPE measurements and their interpretation in the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, information dynamics, and prospective markers of biological coherence.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Engineering and Collective Dynamics in Memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital Memcomputing machines (DMMs) are dynamical systems with memory (time non-locality) that have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Their corresponding ordinary differential equations depend on a few hyper-parameters that define both the system's relevant time scales and its phase-space geometry. Using numerical simulations on a prototypical DMM, we analyze the role of these physical parameters in engineering the phase space to either help or hinder the solution search by DMMs. We find that the DMM explores its phase space efficiently for a wide range of parameters, aided by the system-wide correlations in their fast degrees of freedom that emerge dynamically due to coupling with the (slow) memory degrees of freedom. In this regime, the time it takes for the system to find a solution scales well as the number of variables increases. When these hyper-parameters are chosen poorly, the system navigates its phase space far less efficiently. However, we find that, in many cases, collective behavior persists even when the phase-space exploration process is inefficient. This behavior only disappears if the memories are made to evolve as quickly as the fast degrees of freedom. This study points to the important role of memory and hyper-parameters in engineering the DMMs' phase space for optimal computational efficiency.</description>
