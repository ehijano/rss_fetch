      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Electric fields and waves in the Venus nightside magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On November 6, 2024, the Parker Solar Probe flew past Venus to make the first accurate electric field measurement in the nightside Venusian magnetosphere. To achieve this result, the electric field antennas were current biased in a way never before experienced by an electric field detector. This biasing requirement, that the positive bias current in the Venus shadow be about equal to the electron thermal current, is discussed and illustrated. About one minute of useful electric f ield data in the eight-minute nightside magnetosphere crossing was obtained, during which the only feature observed was a few Hz signal. This result, along with the magnetic field measurements, showed that there were few if any electromagnetic waves, such as low-frequency electromagnetic turbulence or whistlers, in the nightside crossing. Instead, a few Hertz, purely electrostatic signal was found. This suggests that the interaction of the solar wind with an unmagnetized body having an ionosphere may be different from that of previously studied magnetized bodies. In the sunlit flanks, many electromagnetic wave modes were observed. These results describe the first step in the proper technique for future measurements of electric fields in shadow.</description>

      <title>Solar-cycle Variability of Composite Geometry in the Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence are very important topics in the investigations of solar wind. In this work, we use the magnetic field and plasma data from Wind spacecraft measured during 1995 January to 2023 December, which covers more than two solar cycles, to systematically investigate these subjects in the context of solar-cycle variability. The so-called spectrum ratio test and spectrum anisotropy test are employed to determine the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the solar wind turbulence. Both the tests reveal that the solar wind turbulence is dominated by the two-dimensional (2D) component (~80% by turbulence energy). More interestingly, we find that the fraction of slab turbulence increases with the rising sunspot number, and the correlation coefficient between the slab fraction and the sunspot number is 0.61 (ratio test result) or 0.65 (anisotropy test result). This phenomenon suggests that the increasing solar activity (signified by sunspot number) causes increasing slab component in the solar wind turbulence. The relationship between spectral anisotropy and solar activity is discussed and explained. The enhancement of slab fraction is associated with the intensified interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and the increased Alfven speed during the rise phases of the solar cycles. Our findings will be very helpful for achieving a better understanding of the 3D composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence, and especially of their solar-cycle variability.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>

      <title>STE-QUEST -- Space Time Explorer and QUantum Equivalence principle Space Test: The 2022 medium-class mission concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-borne quantum technologies, particularly those based on atom interferometry, are heralding a new era of strategic and robust space exploration. The unique conditions of space, characterized by low noise and low gravity environments, open up diverse possibilities for applications ranging from precise time and frequency transfer to Earth Observation and the search of new Physics. In this paper, we summarise the M-class mission proposal in response to the 2022 call in ESA's science program: Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-QUEST). It consists in a satellite mission featuring a dual-species atom interferometer operating over extended durations. This mission aims to tackle three of the most fundamental questions in Physics: (i) testing the universality of free fall with an accuracy better than one part in $10^{-17}$, (ii) exploring various forms of Ultra-Light Dark Matter, and (iii) scrutinizing the foundations of Quantum Mechanics.</description>
