      <title>Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, for an extensive application range.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Synergy in Adaptive Active Learning for Continuous Lithium Carbonate Crystallization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources, unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible, potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Terahertz Polaritonics in a Quantum Paraelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency range holds immense potential for high-speed data processing and signal manipulation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: the efficient and tunable control of THz electromagnetic fields. One promising approach is polaritonic engineering, which leverages hybrid light-matter excitations to manipulate THz fields at sub-wavelength scales. Here, we introduce quantum paraelectric materials as a powerful new platform for THz phonon-polaritonics, leveraging the pronounced nonlinearities of incipient ferroelectrics. These nonlinearities enable strong self- and cross-coupling between polaritons, facilitating all-optical, reconfigurable THz signal control. Using a novel space- and time-resolved imaging technique, we directly observe the ballistic propagation of bulk phonon-polaritons in SrTiO$_3$, and uncover soliton-like, dispersion-free transport in its low-temperature, quantum-fluctuation-dominated phase. Our results establish quantum paraelectric solids as a versatile and highly tunable medium for next-generation THz photonics and ultrafast information processing.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-Hermitian skin effect and electronic correlations in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model via Real-space dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, characterized by their ability to model open systems with gain and loss, have unveiled striking phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at boundaries under open boundary conditions. While extensively studied in non-interacting systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>
