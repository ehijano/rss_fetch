      <title>HGTDR: Advancing Drug Repurposing with Heterogeneous Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Drug repurposing is a viable solution for reducing the time and cost associated with drug development. However, thus far, the proposed drug repurposing approaches still need to meet expectations. Therefore, it is crucial to offer a systematic approach for drug repurposing to achieve cost savings and enhance human lives. In recent years, using biological network-based methods for drug repurposing has generated promising results. Nevertheless, these methods have limitations. Primarily, the scope of these methods is generally limited concerning the size and variety of data they can effectively handle. Another issue arises from the treatment of heterogeneous data, which needs to be addressed or converted into homogeneous data, leading to a loss of information. A significant drawback is that most of these approaches lack end-to-end functionality, necessitating manual implementation and expert knowledge in certain stages. Results: We propose a new solution, HGTDR (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer for Drug Repurposing), to address the challenges associated with drug repurposing. HGTDR is a three-step approach for knowledge graph-based drug re-purposing: 1) constructing a heterogeneous knowledge graph, 2) utilizing a heterogeneous graph transformer network, and 3) computing relationship scores using a fully connected network. By leveraging HGTDR, users gain the ability to manipulate input graphs, extract information from diverse entities, and obtain their desired output. In the evaluation step, we demonstrate that HGTDR performs comparably to previous methods. Furthermore, we review medical studies to validate our method's top ten drug repurposing suggestions, which have exhibited promising results. We also demon-strated HGTDR's capability to predict other types of relations through numerical and experimental validation, such as drug-protein and disease-protein inter-relations.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality data is crucial for accurate machine learning and actionable analytics, however, mislabeled or noisy data is a common problem in many domains. Distinguishing low- from high-quality data can be challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and considerable manual intervention. Data Valuation algorithms are a class of methods that seek to quantify the value of each sample in a dataset based on its contribution or importance to a given predictive task. These data values have shown an impressive ability to identify mislabeled observations, and filtering low-value data can boost machine learning performance. In this work, we present a simple alternative to existing methods, termed Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity (DVGS). This approach can be easily applied to any gradient descent learning algorithm, scales well to large datasets, and performs comparably or better than baseline valuation methods for tasks such as corrupted label discovery and noise quantification. We evaluate the DVGS method on tabular, image and RNA expression datasets to show the effectiveness of the method across domains. Our approach has the ability to rapidly and accurately identify low-quality data, which can reduce the need for expert knowledge and manual intervention in data cleaning tasks.</description>

      <title>Group Dispersal Modelling revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>
