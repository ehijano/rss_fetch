      <title>Topological observables and $\theta$ dependence in high temperature QCD from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses, and temperatures $T~\gtrsim~180$ MeV. The results obtained with three lattice spacings ranging between $0.057$ and $0.080$ fm are extrapolated to the continuum limit. We compare the results for the topological susceptibility obtained with the field-theoretic definition with those obtained from an observable constructed with the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, and we confirm their agreement -- within the largish errors -- on our range of temperatures. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and, for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talks, on behalf of our collaboration we present an overview of our first-principle lattice QCD calculation of the $D_s\mapsto X \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ inclusive decay rate. Here we introduce the theoretical background and focus on the methodological aspects of the calculation. A detailed discussion of our results, including the comparison with the corresponding experimental measurements will soon be presented in a forthcoming publication.</description>

      <title>Status of two-baryon scattering in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, I will review lattice QCD calculations of baryon-baryon scattering, their methods, and their challenges. In the last few years, there has been a new generation of calculations with increased focus on controlling systematic uncertainties. Contrary to the findings of earlier exploratory calculations, it now appears probable that at heavy pion masses there is no nucleon-nucleon bound state.</description>

      <title>Stochastic automatic differentiation and the Signal to Noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Field theory allows to extract properties of particles in strongly coupled quantum field theories by studying Euclidean vacuum expectation values. When estimated from numerical Monte Carlo simulations these are typically affected by the so called Signal to Noise problem: both the signal and the variance decay exponentially with the Euclidean time, but the variance decays slower, making the signal to noise ratio to degrade exponentially fast. In this work we show that writing correlators as derivatives with respect to sources and evaluating these derivatives using techniques of stochastic automatic differentiation can eliminate completely the signal to noise problem. We show some results in scalar field theories, and comment on the prospects for applicability in Gauge theories and QCD.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Collins-Soper kernel in inclusive DIS at threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the factorization of inclusive deep inelastic scattering near the kinematic threshold to explicitly track off-lightcone effects. Particle production develops around two opposite near-lightcone directions like in transverse-momentum-dependent processes, and the Collins-Soper kernel emerges as a universal function in the rapidity evolution of the relevant parton correlators. We clarify outstanding issues regarding soft radiation and rapidity divergences, and uncover a new way to calculate the Collins-Soper kernel on the lattice with collinear operators.</description>

      <title>Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element $\langle N| m_s \bar{s}s|N\rangle$ on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on the nucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of the strange quark mass, $\left| \Delta m_s/m_s \right| \leq 5.1\%$.</description>

      <title>Generalized determinant inspired by QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connections to mesons, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. Hence, we denote it as `polydeterminant'. Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning approaches to accelerating lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has seen an explosive growth of interest in exploiting developments in machine learning to accelerate lattice QCD calculations. On the sampling side, generative models are a promising approach to mitigating critical slowing down and topological freezing. Meanwhile, signal-to-noise problems have been shown to be improvable by the use of optimized improved observables. Both techniques can be made free of bias, resulting in trustworthy but reduced statistical errors. This talk reviews recent developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>
