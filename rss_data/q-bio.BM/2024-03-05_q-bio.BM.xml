      <title>RiNALMo: General-Purpose RNA Language Models Can Generalize Well on Structure Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a variety of crucial roles in fundamental biological processes. Recently, RNA has become an interesting drug target, emphasizing the need to improve our understanding of its structures and functions. Over the years, sequencing technologies have produced an enormous amount of unlabeled RNA data, which hides important knowledge and potential. Motivated by the successes of protein language models, we introduce RiboNucleic Acid Language Model (RiNALMo) to help unveil the hidden code of RNA. RiNALMo is the largest RNA language model to date with $650$ million parameters pre-trained on $36$ million non-coding RNA sequences from several available databases. RiNALMo is able to extract hidden knowledge and capture the underlying structure information implicitly embedded within the RNA sequences. RiNALMo achieves state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks. Notably, we show that its generalization capabilities can overcome the inability of other deep learning methods for secondary structure prediction to generalize on unseen RNA families. The code has been made publicly available on https://github.com/lbcb-sci/RiNALMo.</description>

      <title>Messenger RNA Design via Expected Partition Function and Continuous Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tasks of designing RNAs are discrete optimization problems, and several versions of these problems are NP-hard. As an alternative to commonly used local search methods, we formulate these problems as continuous optimization and develop a general framework for this optimization based on a generalization of classical partition function which we call "expected partition function". The basic idea is to start with a distribution over all possible candidate sequences, and extend the objective function from a sequence to a distribution. We then use gradient descent-based optimization methods to improve the extended objective function, and the distribution will gradually shrink towards a one-hot sequence (i.e., a single sequence). As a case study, we consider the important problem of mRNA design with wide applications in vaccines and therapeutics. While the recent work of LinearDesign can efficiently optimize mRNAs for minimum free energy (MFE), optimizing for ensemble free energy is much harder and likely intractable. Our approach can consistently improve over the LinearDesign solution in terms of ensemble free energy, with bigger improvements on longer sequences.</description>
