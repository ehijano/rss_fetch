Abstract: I propose a novel interpretation of quantum theory, which I will call Environmental Determinacy-based (EnDQT). In contrast to the well-known interpretations of quantum theory, EnDQT has the benefit of not adding non-local, superdeterministic, or retrocausal hidden variables. Also, it is not in tension with relativistic causality by providing a local causal explanation of quantum correlations. Furthermore, measurement outcomes don't vary according to, for example, systems or worlds. It is a conservative QT in the sense that, unlike theories such as spontaneous collapse theories, no modifications of the fundamental equations of quantum theory are required to establish when determinate values arise. Moreover, in principle, arbitrary systems can be in a coherent superposition for an arbitrary amount of time. According to EnDQT, at a certain stage of the evolution of the universe, some systems acquire the capacity to have and give rise to other systems having determinate values through an indeterministic process. Furthermore, this capacity propagates via local interactions between systems. When systems are isolated from others that have this capacity, they can, in principle, evolve unitarily indefinitely. EnDQT may provide payoffs to other areas of physics and their foundations, such as cosmology, via the features of the systems that start the chains of interactions.</description>
