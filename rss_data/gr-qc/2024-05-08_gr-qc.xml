      <title>Constraints on typical relic gravitational waves based on data of LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relic gravitational waves (RGWs) from early universe carry fundamental information, so it's extraordinarily important to search RGW signals from data of observatories like LIGO-Virgo network. Here, focusing on typical RGWs from inflation and first-order phase transition (by sound waves and bubble collisions), effective and targeted deep learning neural networks are established to search RGW signals among real LIGO data (O2, O3a and O3b). We construct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate likelihood (by quantitative values and distributions) of existence of focused RGW signals in LIGO data, or provide constraints on their strengths. We find if the built CNN properly estimates the parameters of RGWs, it can accurately (about 94% to 99%) determine whether the samples contain RGW signals, and if not, the likelihood given by CNN is not reliable. After testing large amount of LIGO datasets, the results indicate no evidence of RGWs from inflation, sound waves, or bubble collisions predicted by focused theories, and it provides upper limits of their GW spectral energy densities of h^2\Omega_{gw} of 10^{-5} (for various orders of GW amplitude given specific parameter regions by reverse mapping). In short, null results and upper limits are acquire; the methods and neural networks we develop to search RGWs from LIGO data could be effective and reliable, which can be applied not only for current data but also upcoming O4 data or other observational datasets, to establish an available scheme for exploring potential RGW signals or to provide constraints on relevant theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Reconstructed Modified f(Q,T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the reconstruction criterion in the framework of $f(Q,T)$ gravity using ghost dark energy model, where $Q$ represents the non-metricity and $T$ is the trace of energy-momentum tensor. In this regard, the correspondence scenario for a non-interacting scheme is used to construct the ghost dark energy $f(Q,T)$ model. We consider the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with power-law scale factor and pressure-less matter. We investigate the behavior of equation of state parameter and examine the stability of ghost dark energy model via squared speed of sound parameter. The equation of state parameter depicts the phantom era, while the squared speed of sound reveals stable ghost dark energy model for the entire cosmic evolutionary paradigm. Finally, we study the cosmography of the $\omega_{GDE}-\omega'_{GDE}$ and $r-s$ planes that correspond to freezing region and Chaplygin gas model, respectively. It is concluded that the reconstructed ghost dark energy model represents the evolution of the cosmos for suitable choices of the parametric values.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the boundary conditions for a Morris-Thorne wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In physical science, the concept of \emph{emergence} is often used to describe phenomena that occur at macroscopic scales but not at microscopic scales. The latter is usually referred to as a \emph{fundamental property} and the former as an \emph{emergent property}. In this paper, noncommutative geometry, often viewed as an offshoot of string theory, is the primary fundamental theory that gives rise to macroscopic wormholes and their properties, thereby becoming an emergent phenomenon. As a consequence of these considerations, we will reexamine the boundary conditions that characterize a Morris-Thorne wormhole, resulting in a modification of the wormhole structure.</description>

      <title>Nonradial instabilities in anisotropic neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated multi-source global fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called "Erebor," designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmological models in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores matter bounce non-singular cosmology in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. We consider two non-linear $f(R,L_m)$ functional forms, specifically, $f(R,L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + \lambda R^2 + \alpha L_m$ and $f(R,L_m) = \frac{R}{2} + L_m ^\beta + \gamma$ representing a minimal coupling case. We derive the corresponding Friedmann-like equations for both the assumed models in the FLRW background, and then we present the impact of the model parameters along with the parameter of bouncing scale factor on the equation of state parameter, pressure, and the energy density. In addition, we examine the dynamical behavior of cosmographic parameters such as jerk, lerk, and snap parameters. Further, we find that the violation of the null energy condition along with the strong energy condition depicts the non-singular accelerating behavior, corresponding to both assumed non-linear $f(R,L_m)$ functions. Lastly, we present the behavior of the adiabatic speed of sound to examine the viability of the considered cosmological bouncing scenario.</description>

      <title>Thermal analysis of black hole in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity in Barrow entropy framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines a recently hypothesized black hole solution in de Rham--Gabadadze--Tolley massive gravity. Firstly, we consider the negative cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. We extract the thermodynamical properties such as Hawking temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy using the Barrow entropy. We also obtain a new pressure associated to the perfect fluid dark matter and discuss the first-order van der Waals-like phase transition. This black hole's stability is investigated through specific heat and Gibbs free energy. Also, we analyze the thermodynamic curvatures behavior of black hole through geometry methods (Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyah-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM), and geometrothermodynamics (GTD)).</description>

      <title>The simplest model of a scalarized black hole in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schro\"odinger-Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Being Symmetric: Flat Rotation Curves from Exact Axisymmetric Static Vacuum Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the vacuum Einstein Field Equations and a static axisymmetric ansatz, we find two new solutions describing an axisymmetric static vacuum spacetime with cylindrical symmetry: One of this exhibits an additional symmetry in $z$-direction and the other has $z$-coordinate dependent coefficients. In analogy to the Schwarzschild solution, these metrics describe a static vacuum spacetime and apply in similar settings except for the changed symmetry conditions. Analyzing the low-velocity limit corresponding to the Newtonian approximation of the Schwarzschild metric, we find an effective logarithmic potential. This yields flat rotation curves for test particles undergoing rotational motion within the spacetime described by the line elements, in contrast to Newtonian rotation curves. This analysis highlights how important the symmetry assumptions are for deriving general relativistic solutions.
  One example of physical objects that are generally described in the static vacuum low-velocity limit (reducing to Newtonian gravity in the spherically symmetric case) and exhibit axial symmetry are disk galaxies. We show that symmetries and appropriate line elements that respect them are crucial to consider in such settings. In particular, the solutions presented here result in flat rotation curves without any need for dark matter. While these exact solutions are limited to static vacuum spacetimes, their application to physical galaxies relies on appropriate approximations. Nonetheless, they offer valuable insights into explanations for flat rotation curves in galaxies and their implications for dark matter.</description>

      <title>The evolution of expanding spacetime realizes approximate quantum cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum information, encoded in a quantum field, evolves during the expansion of spacetime. Due to information loss across the horizon, a local observer experiences this evolution as a nonunitary quantum channel. We obtain this channel in the case of de Sitter spacetime by assuming the initial global state encodes a signal state via fluctuations of the Bunch-Davies vacuum. Notably, de Sitter evolution exhibits intriguing cloning properties, establishing a connection between the curvature of spacetime and the propagation of quantum information.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the experimental constraints on the parameter $\alpha$ associated with the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and the parameter $\beta$ associated with the Generalized Event Horizon (GEH). The Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence implies a relationship between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with both parameters being of order 1. This presents a problem for our previous `$M+1/M$' model since the extra gravitational force at sub-Planckian masses contravenes observations. Various resolutions of this problem are discussed.</description>

      <title>Is a photon ring invariably a closed structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the image of a rotating compact object (CO) illuminated by a geometrically thin, optically thin disk on the equatorial plane. As the radius of the CO's surface fluctuates, the CO may partially or entirely obscure the photon region. We observe that the perceived photon ring may exhibit discontinuities, deviating from a closed structure, and may even disappear entirely. We find that the disruption and disappearance of the photon ring are dependent on the observational angle$-$a novel phenomenon not previously observed in black hole imaging studies. Our study reveals that while the factors influencing this unique photon ring phenomenon are diverse and the outcomes complex, we can provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the physical essence and variation trends of this phenomenon. We do this by introducing and analyzing the properties and interrelationships of three characteristic functions, $\tilde{\eta}$, $\eta_o$, and $\eta_s$ related to the photon impact parameters. Additionally, our analysis of the intensity cuts and inner shadows of the images uncovers patterns that differ significantly from the shadow curve.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Influence of Geometrical Deformation on Photon Sphere and Shadow Radius: A New Analytical Approach -Stationary, and Axisymmetric Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole shadows and photon spheres offer valuable tools for investigating black hole properties. Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration have confirmed the existence of rotating black holes. Black hole parameters influence the observed shadow size. This paper explores the impact of geometrical deformations on black hole shadow size using gravitational decoupling applied to axially-symmetric spacetime. We find the results are more complex than the spherically-symmetric case. We compare shadows in well-known models with those of an Kerr black hole. Our approach suggests that the influence of an accretion disc on the observed shadow shape can be accurately described despite negligible impact on the black hole geometry itself.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Algebraic symmetries of the observables on the sky: Variable emitters and observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a number of exact relations between optical observables, such as trigonometric parallax, position drift and the proper motion of a luminous source in addition to the variations of redshift and the viewing angle. These relations are valid in general relativity for any spacetime and they are of potential interest for astrometry and precise cosmology. They generalize the well-known Etherington's reciprocity relation between the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. Similar to the Etherington's relation, they hold independently of the spacetime metric, the positions and the motions of a light source or an observer. We show that those relations follow from the symplectic property of the bi-local geodesic operator, i.e., the geometric object that describes the light propagation between two distant regions of a spacetime. The set of relations we present is complete in the sense that no other relations between those observables should hold in general. In the meantime, we develop the mathematical machinery of the bi-local approach to light propagation in general relativity and its corresponding Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Towards field theory of multiple D0-branes. Hamiltonian mechanics and quantization of simplest 3D prototype of multiple D0-brane system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15233v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A confined, slow-moving, accelerating electron is shown to emit thermal radiation. Since laboratories face spatial constraints when dealing with rectilinear motion, focusing on a finite total travel distance combines the benefits of simple theoretical analysis with prospects for table-top experimentation. We demonstrate an accelerated moving charge along an asymptotically static worldline with fixed transit distance and slow maximum speed, emitting self-consistent analytic power, spectra, and energy. The classical radiation is Planck distributed with an associated acceleration temperature. This is the first fully parametrized, spectrum-solved, finite-distance worldline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the consistency of field localization in 5D braneworld scenarios. We derive tensorial consistency relations, Local Sum Rules, which impose constraints on braneworld models featuring quasi-localized bulk fields. We apply these Local Sum Rules to simple cases involving massless scalar, vector, and spinor fields. Our analysis reveals that, when accounting for the effects of the Einstein equations on the bulk field, the free vector and spinor modes cannot be localized on the brane without the introduction of special mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Null states and time evolution in a toy model of black hole dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes can provide non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral that make the actual number of states $e^S$ in a gravitational system much smaller than the number of states $e^{S_{\mathrm{p}}}$ predicted by perturbative semiclassical effective field theory. The effects on the physics of the system are naturally profound in contexts in which the perturbative description actively involves $N = O(e^S)$ of the possible $e^{S_{\mathrm{p}}}$ perturbative states; e.g., in late stages of black hole evaporation. Such contexts are typically associated with the existence of non-trivial quantum extremal surfaces. However, by forcing a simple topological gravity model to evolve in time, we find that such effects can also have large impact for $N\ll e^S$ (in which case no quantum extremal surfaces can arise). In particular, even for small $N$, the insertion of generic operators into the path integral can cause the non-perturbative time evolution to differ dramatically from perturbative expectations. On the other hand, this discrepancy is small for the special case where the inserted operators are non-trivial only in a subspace of dimension $D \ll e^S$. We thus study this latter case in detail. We also discuss potential implications for more realistic gravitational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt the Reall-Santos method to obtain the quadratic curvature corrections to the thermodynamics of Myers-Perry rotating black holes in diverse dimensions. We consider the corrections in canonical and grand canonical ensembles, and also for fixed mass and angular momenta. We find that there exist inevitable divergences for generic rotation parameters so that the perturbative approach breaks down. We present a simple and universal formula to determine where these divergences could arise, and argue, using an explicit example, that these divergences are artefact of perturbation and may not exist in the full nonlinear theory.</description>

      <title>Plasma-Plasma Third Order Phase Transition from type IIB Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the planar, charged black hole in AdS, dual to the strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma thermal state of large $N$, $SU(N)$, $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at finite chemical potential undergoes a third-order phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble to a hairy black hole of type IIB supergravity. The hairy phase is another strongly coupled fluid with a conformal equation of state and can be interpreted as another kind of Quark-Gluon plasma. This new Quark-Gluon plasma has less entropy and, therefore, seems to characterize some form of smooth hadronization. The locus of the transition in terms of the "Baryon" chemical potential, $\mu$, and the temperature, $T$, is $\mu=2\pi T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The salient feature of both classical and quantum gravity is its universal and attractive character. However, less is known about the behaviour and build-up of quantum correlations when quantum systems interact via graviton exchange. In this work, we show that quantum correlations can remain strongly suppressed for certain choices of parameters even when considering two adjacent quantum systems in delocalized states. Using the framework of linearized quantum gravity with post-Newtonian contributions, we find that there are special values of delocalization where gravitationally induced entanglement drops to negligible values, albeit non-vanishing. We find a pronounced cancellation point far from the Planck scale, where the system tends towards classicalization. In addition, we show that quantum correlations begin to reemerge for large and tiny delocalizations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the universal coupling of gravity to the energy-momentum tensor, forming a valley of gravitational entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis have shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <title>Investigating the accelerated expansion of the Universe through updated constraints on viable $f(R)$ models within the Palatini formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed accelerated expansion of the Universe at present epoch can be explained by some of the $f(R)$ models without invoking the existence of dark energy or any other such exotic component in cosmic fluid. The $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism is relatively less explored in recent times with respect to their counterpart in metric formalism. We study seven $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism: Hu-Sawicki (two cases), Starobinsky, exponential, Tsujikawa, $f(R) = R -\beta /R^ n$, and $f(R)= R + \alpha \ln(R) - \beta$. Following standard statistical procedure and utilizing data sets: type Ia supernovae data, cosmic chronometer observations, baryonic acoustic oscillations data, data from H \textsc{ii} starburst galaxies, local measurements of the \emph{Hubble} parameter ($H_{0}$), and distance priors of cosmic microwave background radiation data, we obtain constraints on the model parameters. When compared with the standard `lambda-cold dark matter model', for many data set combinations, the support for $f(R)$ models is significant. We obtain the relevant quantities for characterizing the accelerated expansion of the Universe, and these quantities are consistent with those obtained in a model-independent way by others. The curve of effective/total equation-of-state parameter, obtained from parameter constraints, clearly shows correct phases of the expansion history: the radiation-dominated epochs and the matter-dominated epochs, of the past, and the current accelerated expansion epoch eventually evolving to de-Sitter phase in the distant future. Overall, our results advocate in favour of pursuing $f(R)$ models in Palatini formalism as a potential alternative for explaining accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We study the probabilities of a field, subject to random perturbations, to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. We find that the probability to roll down to the left or right depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct self-gravitating razor-thin disks of counterrotating dust around Schwarzschild black holes (BHs) by applying the "displace, cut, and reflect" method to known seed solutions representing multi-holes. All but one of the sources of the seed solution generate the surrounding annular disk, whereas the remaining BH is kept unaltered and lies at the disk center after the transformation. The disks are infinite in extent, have annular character, and are linearly stable up to the innermost stable circular orbit of the system. Moreover, all energy conditions are satisfied along the disk and the spacetime is asymptotically flat, having finite ADM mass. We also comment on charged disks around extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs constructed from a Majumdar-Papapetrou $N$-BH seed solution. These simple examples can be extended to more general "BH + disk" solutions, obtained by the same method from seeds of the type "BH + arbitrary axisymmetric source". A natural follow-up of this work would be to construct disks around Reissner-Nordstr\"om BHs with arbitrary charge-to-mass ratio and around Kerr BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently there has been an interest in exploring black holes that are regular in the sense that the central curvature singularity is avoided. Here, we depict a method to obtain a regular black hole (RBH) spacetime $(\mathcal{M}, \Tilde{g})$ from the unhindered gravitational collapse from regular initial data of a spherically symmetric perfect fluid $(\mathcal{M}, g)$. In other words, we obtain the equilibrium metric $\Tilde g$ as a limiting case of the time-evolving metric $g$. In the spirit of Joshi, Malafarina and Narayan (\textit{Class. Quantum Grav. 31, 015002, 2014}), our description of gravitational collapse is implicit in nature in the sense that we do not describe the data at each time-slice. Rather, we impose a condition in terms of geometric and matter variables for the collapse to have an end-state that is devoid of incomplete geodesics but admits a marginally trapped surface (MTS). The admission of MTS causally disconnects two mutually exclusive regions $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_1$ and $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_2\subset \mathcal{M}$ in the sense that $\forall~p\in\Hat{\mathcal{M}_2}$, the causal past of $p$ does not intersect $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_1$. While the classic Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model necessarily produces a black hole with a Schwarzschild singularity at the centre, we show here that there are classes of regular initial conditions for which the collapse gives rise to a RBH.</description>

Abstract: We derive the exact solutions for electrically charged black holes both in the absence and presence of a cosmological constant in the gravity theory with Lorentz violation induced by a background Kalb-Ramond (KR) field. The corresponding thermodynamic properties are investigated. It is found that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr formula remain valid for the charged KR black holes. Nevertheless, the Lorentz-violating effect influences their ranges of local thermodynamic stability and the first- and second-order phase transition points. Furthermore, to examine the impact of Lorentz violation on the motion of test particles in the spacetime, we analyze the shadow and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of these black holes. Our results reveal that both the shadow and ISCO radii exhibit a high sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, with a decrease observed as $\ell$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of the thermodynamics phase transitions and critical phenomena of an FLRW cosmological model under the so-called Kaniadakis's statistics. The equation of state is derived from the corrected Friedmann field equations and the thermodynamics unified first law. This reveals the existence of non-trivial critical points where a first-order phase transition takes place. The system behaves as an "inverted" van der Waals fluid in this concern. Interestingly, the numerical values of the critical exponents are the same as those of the van der Waals system. Besides, to obtain more insights into the thermodynamics description, the so-called Ruppeiner's geometry is studied through the normalized scalar curvature, disclosing this invariant zone where the system undergoes repulsive/attractive interactions. Near the critical point, this curvature provides again the same critical exponent and universal constant value as for van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model gravitating relativistic 3D spheres composed of an anisotropic fluid in which the radial and transverse components of the pressure correspond to the vacuum energy and a generalized polytropic equation-of-state, respectively. By using the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, and solving the complete system of equations for these anisotropic generalized polytropic spheres, for a given range of model parameters, we find three novel classes of asymptotically AdS black hole solutions with regular core. We show the regularity of the solutions using curvature scalars and the formalism of geodesic completeness. Then, using the eigenvalues of the Riemann curvature tensor, we consider the effects of repulsive gravity in the three static 3D regular black holes, concluding that their regular behavior can be explained as due to the presence of repulsive gravity near the center of the objects. Finally, we study the stability of the regular black holes under the flow of the energy through the Cauchy horizon.</description>

Abstract: Disformal transformations of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker and Bianchi geometries are analyzed in the context of scalar-tensor gravity. Novel aspects discussed explicitly are the $3+1$ splitting, the effective fluid equivalent of the gravitational scalar, Bianchi models, stealth solutions, and de Sitter solutions with non-constant scalar field (which are signatures of scalar-tensor gravity). Both pure disformal transformations and more general ones are discussed, including those containing higher derivatives of the scalar field recently introduced in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect the stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) inspiralling in the low-frequency band, which exist in several years before the merger. Accurate GW waveforms in the inspiral phase are crucial for the detection and analysis of those SBBHs. In our study, based on post-Newtonian (PN) models, we investigate the differences in the detection, accuracy requirement, and parameter estimation of SBBHs in the cases of LISA, Taiji, and their joint detection. We find that low-order PN models are sufficient for simulating low-mass ($\le 50\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$) SBBHs population. Moreover, for detectable SBBHs in space-based GW detectors, over 90% of the GW signals from low-order PN models meet accuracy requirement. Additionally, different PN models do not exhibit significant differences in Bayesian inference. Our research provides a comprehensive reference for balancing computational resources and the desired accuracy of GW waveform generation. It highlights the suitability of low-order PN models for simulating SBBHs and emphasizes their potential in the detection and parameter estimation of SBBHs.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this structure of the trapping horizons "Type II PBH", while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon "Type I PBH", which is typically generated from a relatively small amplitude of the initial fluctuation. In Ref.[1], in the dust-dominated universe, the Type II PBH can be realized by the Type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case with a monotonic areal radius (Type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type II PBH in the case of the radiation fluid. We also find that for the initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

      <title>Shadows of rotating hairy Kerr black holes coupled to time periodic scalar fields with non-flat target space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the shadows cast by rotating hairy black holes with two non-trivial time-periodic scalar fields having a non-flat Gaussian curvature of the target space spanned by the scalar fields. Such black holes are a viable alternative to the Kerr black hole, having a much more complicated geodesic structure and resulting shadows. We investigate how a nontrivial Gauss curvature alters the pictures for different amounts of scalar hair around the black holes, quantified by a normalized charge. Our results show that for high values of this charge, close to a boson star limit, chaotic shadows are observed with multiple small disconnected components for all considered Gaussian curvatures. For moderately large amounts of scalar hair and corresponding normalized charge, although the shadows still exhibit chaotic behavior, a dominant shadow component emerges, the size and shape of which are substantially influenced by the Gaussian curvature. For instance, highly chaotic shadows for flat target space, start developing a large central shadow region with the increase of the Gauss curvature even for black holes with substantially heavy scalar hair. For lower values of the normalized charge, the shadows resemble qualitatively the Kerr black hole while the Gaussian curvature has a small impact on their properties.</description>

      <title>Particle Creation in a Linear Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the pioneering 1968 work of L Parker, demonstrating matter quanta production in a dynamical spacetime background, we consider production of scalar quanta in a gravitational wave background. Choosing the spacetime to be a flat spacetime perturbed linearly by a linear gravitational wave, we show that scalar particles may indeed be produced in a perturbative manner. Our formulation is valid for any linear gravitational wave background profile, and is by no means restricted to monochromatic plane waves, in contrast to much of the earlier work on this topic. Thus, our work is directly applicable to gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescence detected at LIGO, where they are of a pulsed character rather than monochromatic plane waves. We also briefly outline generalizing our approach for photon creation in a gravitational wave background. In this aspect, irrespective of the astrophysical nature of the binary merger sourcing the gravitational wave signal, one expects the dynamical nature of the spacetime to produce all species of light particles. Thus, any binary coalescence is in effect a source of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Torsion and Chern-Simons gravity in 4D space-times from a Geometrodynamical four-form</title>

Abstract: In Hermann Minkowski's pioneering formulation of special relativity, the space-time geometry in any inertial frame is described by the line-element $ds^2= \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$. It is interesting to note that not only the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ is invariant under proper Lorentz transformations, the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ too is. In general relativity (GR), $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ of the flat space-time gets generalized to a dynamical, space-time dependent metric tensor $ g_{\mu \nu} $ that characterizes a curved space-time geometry. In the present study, it is put forward that the flat space-time Levi-Civita tensor gets elevated to a dynamical four-form field $\tilde {w} $ in curved space-time manifolds, i.e. $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} \rightarrow w_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} (x) = \phi (x) \ e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ so that $\tilde {w} = {1\over {4!}} \ w_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} \ \tilde{d} x^\mu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\nu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\rho \wedge \tilde{d} x^\sigma$. It is shown that this geometrodynamical four-form field, extends GR by leading naturally to a torsion in the theory as well as to a Chern-Simons gravity. In order to subject the hypothesized four-form field $\tilde {w}$ to observational evidence, we first argue that the associated scalar-density $\phi (x)$ corresponds to an axion-like pseudo-scalar field in the Minkowski space-time, and that it can also masquerade as dark matter. Thereafter, we provide a simple semi-classical analysis in which a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate of such ultra-light pseudo-scalars leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Polarization Detection with Pyramid Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we have introduced the Pyramid Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory (PCGO) for GW polarization detection. The PCGO is composed of four identical spacecrafts (S/Cs). The laser telescopes and their pointing structures are mounted on the S/C platform and are evenly distributed at three locations 120 degrees apart. Compared to a three-S/C configuration, the addition of a fourth S/C and its mounted telescope serve as redundant backups, especially for the telescopes, which together with the other two telescopes, automatically form a stable mass center for the platform without the need for trim mass. Since the radial distance of S/C4 is greater than that of the other spacecraft, the three arm lengths associated with S/C4 change significantly over a one-year period. Time delay interferometry (TDI) has been proven effective for suppressing frequency noise in this context. The unequal arm Michelson TDI configuration and the Sagnac TDI configuration are equally effective for eliminating the laser frequency noise based on the PCGO configuration. Compared to the configurations of LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, the PCGO has more combinations of optical paths in its TDI system, offering greater sensitivity to GW signals. The configuration of PCGO is simultaneously sensitive to the six polarization modes of GWs, which means that it allows for greater flexibility in extracting the polarization components from the total GW polarization signals.</description>

      <title>New physics from the polarised light of the cosmic microwave background</title>

Abstract: Cosmology requires new physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles and fields. What is the fundamental physics behind dark matter and dark energy? What generated the initial fluctuations in the early Universe? Polarised light of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) may hold the key to answers. In this article, we discuss two new developments in this research area. First, if the physics behind dark matter and dark energy violates parity symmetry, their coupling to photons rotates the plane of linear polarisation as the CMB photons travel more than 13 billion years. This effect is known as `cosmic birefringence': space filled with dark matter and dark energy behaves as if it were a birefringent material, like a crystal. A tantalising hint for such a signal has been found with the statistical significance of $3\sigma$. Next, the period of accelerated expansion in the very early Universe, called `cosmic inflation', produced a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GW). What generated GW? The leading idea is vacuum fluctuations in spacetime, but matter fields could also produce a significant amplitude of primordial GW. Finding its origin using CMB polarisation opens a new window into the physics behind inflation. These new scientific targets may influence how data from future CMB experiments are collected, calibrated, and analysed.</description>

Abstract: In AdS/CFT, partition functions of decoupled CFTs living on separate asymptotic boundaries factorize. However, the presence of bulk wormholes connecting different boundaries tends to spoil the factorization of the bulk partition function, which leads to a disagreement between the two sides. In this paper, we present two examples where wormhole contributions cancel each other in bulk partition function calculations, thus the bulk factorization can be realized. The first example is in 2-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the proposed way of realizing the cancellation resides in the extra complex phases associated with different wormholes. The phases arise due to the degenerate vacua structure. In the example of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, the cancellation can be achieved due to the distribution of the wormhole saddles on a complex plane. The two examples demonstrate a way of realizing bulk partition function factorization by extending the Hilbert space and dressing wormhole saddles with extra phases.</description>

      <title>Rapid determination of LISA sensitivity to extreme mass ratio inspirals with machine learning</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of the inspiral of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes (MBHs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), enable precision measurements of parameters such as the MBH mass and spin. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to detect sufficient EMRIs to probe the underlying source population, testing theories of the formation and evolution of MBHs and their environments. Population studies are subject to selection effects that vary across the EMRI parameter space, which bias inference results if unaccounted for. This bias can be corrected, but evaluating the detectability of many EMRI signals is computationally expensive. We mitigate this cost by (i) constructing a rapid and accurate neural network interpolator capable of predicting the signal-to-noise ratio of an EMRI from its parameters, and (ii) further accelerating detectability estimation with a neural network that learns the selection function, leveraging our first neural network for data generation. The resulting framework rapidly estimates the selection function, enabling a full treatment of EMRI detectability in population inference analyses. We apply our method to an astrophysically motivated EMRI population model, demonstrating the potential selection biases and subsequently correcting for them. Accounting for selection effects, we predict that LISA will measure the MBH mass function slope to a precision of 8.8%, the CO mass function slope to a precision of 4.6%, the width of the MBH spin magnitude distribution to a precision of 10% and the event rate to a precision of 12% with EMRIs at redshifts below z=6.</description>

      <title>Fast radio burst energy function in the presence of $\rm DM_{host}$ variation</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers, but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on the origin of FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few FRBs that have been detected recently show large excess DMs beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DMs from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt two lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models to a constant ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined.</description>

Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>

Abstract: It was shown recently that extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant is a dynamical variable, giving rise to a pressure $p$ and its conjugate volume $V$, can be given a natural setting in the context of braneworld models. We study the specific heat capacities $C_p(T)$ and $C_V(T)$ of the quantum version of the BTZ black hole that lives in the induced gravity theory on the brane. There are multiple branches of solutions, and we explore and characterize key features of the possible behaviour. We identify and study a critical point in the space of solutions where both specific heats diverge. In the regime of weak backreaction where we a close to an ordinary theory of gravity, the black hole is "sub-entropic", but as backreaction is increased we note that there are parts of parameter space that has regions where it is "super-entropic". While a study of the sign of the specific heats does not always show a corresponding instability (conjectured in the literature), the presence of strong backreaction makes interpretation unclear.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classification of supersymmetric black hole solutions to five-dimensional STU gauged supergravity that admit torus symmetry. This reduces to a problem in toric K\"ahler geometry on the base space. We introduce the class of separable toric K\"ahler surfaces that unify product-toric, Calabi-toric and orthotoric K\"ahler surfaces, together with an associated class of separable 2-forms. We prove that any supersymmetric toric solution that is timelike, with a separable K\"ahler base space and Maxwell fields, outside a horizon with a compact (locally) spherical cross-section, must be locally isometric to the known black hole or its near-horizon geometry. An essential part of the proof is a near-horizon analysis which shows that the only possible separable K\"ahler base space is Calabi-toric. In particular, this also implies that our previous black hole uniqueness theorem for minimal gauged supergravity applies to the larger class of separable K\"ahler base spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a top-down construction of a three-dimensional non-local theory of massive gravity. This "Non-Local Massive Gravity" (NLMG) is obtained as the gravitational theory induced by Einstein gravity on a brane inserted in Anti-de Sitter space modified by an overall minus sign. The theory involves an infinite series of increasingly complicated higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action, with the quadratic term coinciding with New Massive Gravity. We obtain an analytic formula for the quadratic action of NLMG and show that its linearized spectrum consists of an infinite tower of positive-energy massive spin-2 modes. We compute the Newtonian potential and show that the introduction of the infinite series of terms makes it behave as $\sim 1/r$ at short distances, as opposed to the logarithmic behavior encountered when the series is truncated at any finite order. We use this and input from brane-world holography to argue that the theory may contain asymptotically flat black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Accretion flows around spinning compact objects in the post-Newtonian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the structure of a low angular momentum accretion flows around rotating compact objects incorporating relativistic corrections up to the leading post-Newtonian order. To begin with, we formulate the governing post-Newtonian hydrodynamic equations for the mass and energy-momentum flux without imposing any symmetries. However, for the sake of simplicity, we consider the flow to be stationary, axisymmetric, and inviscid. Toward this, we adapt the polytropic equation of state (EoS) and analyze the vertically integrated accretion flow confined to the equatorial plane. It is shown that the spin-orbit effects manifest themselves in the accretion dynamics. In the present analysis, we focus on global transonic accretion solutions, where a subsonic flow enters far away from the compact object and gradually gains radial velocity as it moves inwards. Thus, the flow becomes supersonic after reaching a certain radius, known as the critical point. To better understand the transonic solutions and examine the effect of post-Newtonian corrections, we classify the post-Newtonian equations into semi-relativistic (SR), semi-Newtonian (SN), and non-relativistic (NR) limits and compare the accretion solutions and their corresponding flow variables. With these, we find that SR and SN flow are in good agreement all throughout, although they deviate largely from the NR ones. Interestingly, the density profile seems to follow the profile $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ in the post-Newtonian regime. The present study has the potential to connect Newtonian and GR descriptions of accretion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Blandford Znajek Jet in Loop Quantum Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process powers energetic jets by extracting the rotating energy of a Kerr black hole. It is important to understand this process in non-Kerr black hole spacetimes. In this study, we conduct two-dimensional and three-dimensional two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows onto a rotating Loop-Quantum black hole (LQBH). Our investigation focuses on the accretion flow structure and jet launching dynamics from our simulations. We observe that the loop quantum effects increase the black hole angular frequency for spinning black holes.This phenomenon intensifies the frame-dragging effect, leading to an amplification of the toroidal magnetic field within the funnel region and enhancement of the launching jet power. It is possible to fit the jet power following a similar fitting formula of the black hole angular frequency as seen in the Kerr black hole. Based on the General Relativistic Radiation Transfer (GRRT) calculation, we find that the jet image from LQBH has a wider opening angle and an extended structure than the Kerr BH.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$ with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Dark matter and space-time symmetry restoration</title>

Abstract: We examine local physics in the presence of global variables: variables associated with the whole of the spacelike surfaces of a foliation. These could be the (pseudo-)constants of nature and their conjugate times, but our statements are more general. Interactions between the local and the global (for example, dependence of the local action on global times dual to constants) degrades full space-time diffeomorphism invariance down to spatial diffeomorphism invariance, and so an extra degree of freedom appears. When these presumably primordial global interactions switch off, the local action recovers full invariance and so the usual two gravitons, but a legacy matter component is left over, bearing the extra degree of freedom. Under the assumption that the preferred foliation is geodesic, this component behaves like dark matter, except that 3 of its 4 local degrees of freedom are frozen, forcing its rest frame to coincide with the preferred foliation. The non-frozen degree of freedom (the number density of the effective fluid) is the survivor of the extra "graviton" present in the initial theory, and keeps memory of all the past global interactions that took place in a given location in the preferred foliation. Such "painted-on" dark matter is best distinguished from the conventional one in situations where the preferred frame would be preposterous if all 4 degrees of freedom of dark matter were available. We provide one example: an outflowing halo of legacy matter with exact escape speed at each point and a very specific profile, surrounding a condensed structure made of normal matter.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once: A detailed study of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the origins of GW230529, delving into its formation from massive stars within isolated binary systems. Utilizing population synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms second. However, the event's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately $5.3 M_\odot$ and $0.53$, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to range within $0-0.06 M_{\odot}$, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonovae light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.</description>
