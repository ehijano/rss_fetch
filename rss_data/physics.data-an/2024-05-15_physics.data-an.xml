      <title>Evaluating the Uncertainty in Mean Residual Times: Estimators Based on Residence Times from Discrete Time Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose estimators for the uncertainty in mean residual times that require, for their evaluation, statistically independent individual residence times obtained from a discrete time process. We examine their performance through numerical experiments involving well-known probability distributions, and an application example using molecular dynamics simulation results, from an aqueous NaCl solution, is provided. These computationally inexpensive estimators, capable of achieving very accurate outcomes, serve as useful tools for assessing and reporting uncertainties in mean residual times across a wide range of simulations.</description>

      <title>Drag prediction of rough-wall turbulent flow using data-driven regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient tools for predicting the drag of rough walls in turbulent flows would have a tremendous impact. However, methods for drag prediction rely on experiments or numerical simulations which are costly and time-consuming. Data-driven regression methods have the potential to provide a prediction that is accurate and fast. We assess the performance and limitations of linear regression, kernel methods and neural networks for drag prediction using a database of 1000 homogeneous rough surfaces. Model performance is evaluated using the roughness function obtained at friction-scaled Reynolds number 500. With two trainable parameters, the kernel method can fully account for nonlinear relations between $\Delta U^+$ and surface statistics (roughness height, effective slope, skewness, etc). In contrast, linear regression cannot account for nonlinear correlations and display large errors and high uncertainty. Multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks demonstrate performance on par with the kernel method but have orders of magnitude more trainable parameters. For the current database size, the networks' capacity cannot be fully exploited, resulting in reduced generalizability and reliability. Our study provides insight into the appropriateness of different regression models for drag prediction. We also discuss the remaining steps before data-driven methods emerge as useful tools in applications.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Re-Uploads: A Pathway to Improved Quantum Classification Data Re-Uploading Strategies for Improved Quantum Classifier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Flows for Domain Adaptation when Identifying $\Lambda$ Hyperon Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the novel application of a normalizing flow as a method of domain adaptation. Normalizing flows offer a way to transform data points between two different distributions. The present study investigates a method of transforming latent representations of physics data to a normal distribution and then to a physics distribution again. The final distribution models a simulated distribution. Following the transformation process, the data can be classified by a neural network trained on labeled simulation data. The present study succeeds in training two normalizing flows that can transform between data (or simulation) and a Gaussian distribution.</description>
