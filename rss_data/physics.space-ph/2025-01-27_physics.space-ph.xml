      <title>Solar irradiance statistical analysis in Mexico City from 2018 to 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radiation is made up of three components of electromagnetic waves: infrared, visible and ultraviolet. The infrared component is the cause of thermal energy, the visible spectrum allows to see through the eyes and the ultraviolet component is the most energetic and damaging. Solar radiation has several benefits, such as helping to synthesize vitamin D in the skin, favors blood circulation, among others benefits for the human body. In the Earth, it is the main source of energy for agriculture, also used as an alternative source of energy to hydrocarbons, through solar cells. The solar irradiance represents the surface power density with units W/m$^2$ in SI. Too much exposure can cause damage and an increase in value over the time can be can be also damaging. In this work it was used an open data base provided by Secretar\'ia del Medio Ambiente, from which a statistical analysis was performed of the solar irradiance values measured at various meteorological stations in Mexico City and the so-called metropolitan area, from 2018 to 2021. This analysis was carried out per years, months and days. From the solar irradiance values distributions, it was obtained the averages, maximums and means were it was found there was no variation in the solar irradiance values over this period of years.</description>

      <title>Passivity-Based Robust Shape Control of a Cable-Driven Solar Sail Boom for the CABLESSail Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar sails provide a means of propulsion using solar radiation pressure, which offers the possibility of exciting new spacecraft capabilities. However, solar sails have attitude control challenges because of the significant disturbance torques that they encounter due to imperfections in the sail and its supporting structure, as well as limited actuation capabilities. The Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept was previously proposed to overcome these challenges by controlling the shape of the sail through cable actuation. The structural flexibility of CABLESSail introduces control challenges, which necessitate the design of a robust feedback controller for this system. The purpose of the proposed research here is to design a robust controller to ensure precise and reliable control of CABLESSail's boom. Taking into account the system dynamics and the dynamic properties of the CABLESSail concept, a passivity-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller for a single boom on the CABLESSail system is designed. To reach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally applied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead of the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip deflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests using a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the test results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input robustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of two episodes of strongly geoeffective CME events in November and December 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autumn 2023, a series of closely timed eruptive events were observed remotely and measured in situ. We studied analogous solar events, where several CMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These events occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering October 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to strong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to understand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed geomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each CME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with enhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ measurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The first episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on November 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a SBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode saw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1, 2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a preceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the shock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field 'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This study compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and December 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations contributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November 4-5, 2023 event. The highly tilted heliospheric current sheet may have further influenced the CMEs' impact at Earth.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Could Have Predicted All Space Weather Events Associated with the May 2024 Superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather, driven by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), poses significant risks to technological systems. Accurately forecasting these events and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of the complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$ superstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644, Earth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram cut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active region morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the occurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of CME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind measurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to sound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as one minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in predicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storm. These findings highlight the impressive potential of AI for space weather forecasting and as a tool to mitigate the impact of extreme solar events on critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Evolution of MHD turbulence in the expanding solar wind: residual energy and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of decaying turbulence in the solar wind context. To account for the spherical expansion of the solar wind, we implement the expanding box model. The initial turbulence comprises uncorrelated counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves and exhibits an isotropic power spectrum. Our findings reveal the consistent generation of negative residual energy whenever nonlinear interactions are present, independent of the normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c$ and compressibility. The spherical expansion facilitates this process. The resulting residual energy is primarily distributed in the perpendicular direction, with $[S_2(\mathbf{b})-S_2(\mathbf{u})] \propto l_\perp$ or equivalently $-E_r \propto k_\perp^{-2}$. Here $S_2(\mathbf{b})$ and $S_2(\mathbf{u})$ are second-order structure functions of magnetic field and velocity respectively. In most runs, $S_2(\mathbf{b})$ develops a scaling relation $S_2(\mathbf{b}) \propto l_\perp^{1/2}$ ($E_b \propto k_\perp^{-3/2}$). In contrast, $S_2(\mathbf{u})$ is consistently shallower than $S_2(\mathbf{b})$, which aligns with in-situ observations of the solar wind. We observe that the higher-order statistics of the turbulence, which act as a proxy for intermittency, depend on the initial $\sigma_c$ and are strongly affected by the expansion effect. Generally, the intermittency is more pronounced when the expansion effect is present. Finally, we find that in our simulations although the negative residual energy and intermittency grow simultaneously as the turbulence evolves, the causal relation between them seems to be weak, possibly because they are generated on different scales.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude with a discussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>
