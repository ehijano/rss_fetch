      <title>Addendum: Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Year-2 data release of the DESI collaboration, we update our results on time-varying dark energy models driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson bound. The previously found preference of time-dependent dark energy models compared to $\Lambda$CDM is further strengthend by the new data release. For our particular models, we find that this preference increases up to $\approx 2.6\,\sigma$ depending on the used supernova dataset.</description>

      <title>Discovering $\mu$Hz gravitational waves and ultra-light dark matter with binary resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a weak gravitational wave (GW) background, astrophysical binary systems act as high-quality resonators, with efficient transfer of energy and momentum between the orbit and a harmonic GW leading to potentially detectable orbital perturbations. In this work, we develop and apply a novel modeling and analysis framework that describes the imprints of GWs on binary systems in a fully time-resolved manner to study the sensitivity of lunar laser ranging, satellite laser ranging, and pulsar timing to both resonant and nonresonant GW backgrounds. We demonstrate that optimal data collection, modeling, and analysis lead to projected sensitivities which are orders of magnitude better than previously appreciated possible, opening up a new possibility for probing the physics-rich but notoriously challenging to access $\mu\mathrm{Hz}$ frequency GWs. We also discuss improved prospects for the detection of the stochastic fluctuations of ultra-light dark matter, which may analogously perturb the binary orbits.</description>

      <title>On DESI's DR2 exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration, combining their Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and supernovae data, have found significant indication against $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The significance of the exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM can be interpreted entirely as significance of the detection of the $\boldsymbol{w_a}$ parameter that measures variation of the dark energy equation of state. We emphasize that DESI's DR2 exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM is quoted in the articles for a combination of BAO and CMB data with each of three different and overlapping supernovae datasets (at 2.8-sigma for Pantheon+, 3.8-sigma for Union3, and 4.2-sigma for DESY5). We show that one can neither choose amongst nor average over these three different significances. We demonstrate how a principled statistical combination yields a combined exclusion significance of 3.1-sigma. Further we argue that, based on available knowledge, and faced with these competing significances, the most secure inference from the DESI DR2 results is the 3.1-sigma level exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM, obtained from combining DESI+CMB alone, while omitting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Extended Parameter Space with DESI DR2 BAO: A 2$\sigma$+ Detection of Non-zero Neutrino Masses with an Update on Dynamical Dark Energy and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain constraints in a 12 parameter cosmological model using the recent DESI Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data, combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra (Planck Public Release (PR) 4) and lensing (Planck PR4 + Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release (DR) 6) data, uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) data from Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL: DES Year 1) data. The cosmological model consists of six $\Lambda$CDM parameters, and additionally, the dynamical dark energy parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\textrm{eff}}$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\textrm{lens}}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). Our major findings are the following: i) With CMB+BAO+DESY5+WL, we obtain the first 2$\sigma$+ detection of a non-zero $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.19^{+0.15}_{-0.18}$ eV (95%). Replacing DESY5 with Pantheon+ still yields a $\sim$1.9$\sigma$ detection. ii) The cosmological constant lies at the edge of the 95% contour with CMB+BAO+Pantheon+, but is excluded at 2$\sigma$+ with DESY5, leaving evidence for dynamical dark energy inconclusive, contrary to claims by DESI collaboration. iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, $A_{\textrm{lens}} = 1$ is excluded at $&gt;2\sigma$, while it remains consistent with unity without WL data - suggesting for the first time that the existence of lensing anomaly may depend on non-CMB datasets. iv) The Hubble tension persists at 3.6-4.2$\sigma$ with CMB+BAO+SNe; WL data has minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Joint 21-cm and CMB Forecasts for Constraining Self-Interacting Massive Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interacting neutrinos provide an intriguing extension to the Standard Model, motivated by both particle physics and cosmology. Recent cosmological analyses suggest a bimodal posterior for the coupling strength $G_{\rm eff}$, favoring either strong or moderate interactions. These interactions modify the scale-dependence of the growth of cosmic structures, leaving distinct imprints on the matter power spectrum at small scales, $k\,&gt;\,0.1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. For the first time, we explore how the 21-cm power spectrum from the cosmic dawn and the dark ages can constrain the properties of self-interacting, massive neutrinos. The effects of small-scale suppression and enhancement in the matter power spectrum caused by self-interacting neutrinos propagate to the halo mass function, shaping the abundance of small- and intermediate-mass halos. It is precisely these halos that host the galaxies responsible for driving the evolution of the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn. We find that HERA at its design sensitivity can improve upon existing constraints on $G_{\rm eff}$ and be sensitive to small values of the coupling, beyond the reach of current and future CMB experiments. Crucially, we find that the combination of HERA and CMB-S4 can break parameter degeneracies, significantly improving the sensitivity to $G_{\rm eff}$ over either experiment alone. Finally, we investigate the prospects of probing neutrino properties with futuristic Lunar interferometers, accessing the astrophysics-free 21-cm power spectrum during the dark ages. The capability of probing small scales of these instruments will allow us to reach a percent-level constraint on the neutrino self-coupling.</description>

      <title>On the Connection between Field-Level Inference and $n$-point Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian field-level inference of galaxy clustering guarantees optimal extraction of all cosmological information, provided that the data are correctly described by the forward model employed. The latter is unfortunately never strictly the case. A key question for field-level inference approaches then is where the cosmological information is coming from, and how to ensure that it is robust. In the context of perturbative approaches such as effective field theory, some progress on this question can be made analytically. We derive the parameter posterior given the data for the field-level likelihood given in the effective field theory, marginalized over initial conditions in the zero-noise limit. Particular attention is paid to cutoffs in the theory, the generalization to higher orders, and the error made by an incomplete forward model at a given order. The main finding is that, broadly speaking, an $m$-th order forward model captures the information in $n$-point correlation functions with $n \leqslant m+1$. Thus, by adding more terms to the forward model, field-level inference is made to automatically incorporate higher-order $n$-point functions. Also shown is how the effect of an incomplete forward model (at a given order) on the parameter inference can be estimated.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (III) The Mysteries of the Milky Way UV Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are hypothetical objects with nuclear density that would have formed during the quark-hadron transition and could make up most of the dark matter today. These objects have a mass greater than a few grams and are sub-micrometer in size. They would also help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the similarity between visible and dark components of the universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\text{DM}} \sim \Omega_{\text{visible}}$. These composite objects behave as cold dark matter, interacting with ordinary matter and producing pervasive electromagnetic radiation. This work aims to calculate the FUV electromagnetic signature in a 1 kpc region surrounding the solar system, resulting from the interaction between antimatter AQNs and baryons. To this end, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamic simulation of the Milky Way, FIRE-2 Latter suite, to select solar system-like regions. From the simulated gas and dark matter distributions in these regions, we calculate the FUV background radiation generated by the AQN model. We find that the results are consistent with the FUV excess recently confirmed by the Alice spectrograph aboard New Horizons, which corroborated the FUV excess initially discovered by GALEX a decade ago. We also discuss the potential cosmological implications of our work, which suggest the existence of a new source of FUV radiation in galaxies, linked to the interaction between dark matter and baryons.</description>

      <title>Minimal Magnetogenesis: The Role of Inflationary Perturbations and ALPs, and Its Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at $\Mpc$ scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in tomographic Angular Density and Redshift Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes, namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z \neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF (ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time, configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for wider shell ($\sigma_z&gt;0.02$) configurations.</description>

      <title>An analytic redshift-independent formulation of baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic effects created by feedback processes associated with galaxy formation are an important, poorly constrained systematic effect for models of large-scale structure as probed by weak gravitational lensing. Upcoming surveys require fast methods to predict and marginalize over the potential impact of baryons on the total matter power spectrum. Here we use the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to test a recent proposal to approximate the matter power spectrum as the sum of the linear matter power spectrum and a constant multiple, $A_{\rm mod}$, of the difference between the linear and non-linear gravity-only power spectra. We show that replacing this constant multiple with a one-parameter family of sigmoid functions of the wavenumber $k$ allows to us match the predictions of simulations with different feedback strengths for $z \leq 1, k &lt; 3~h\cdot{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, and the different cosmological models in the FLAMINGO suite. The baryonic response predicted by FLAMINGO models that use jet-like AGN feedback instead of the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback can also be reproduced, but at the cost of increasing the number of parameters in the sigmoid function from one to three. The assumption that $A_{\rm mod}$ depends only on $k$ breaks down for decaying dark matter models, highlighting the need for more advanced baryon response models when studying cosmological models that deviate strongly from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Development of an Ultra-fast, Likelihood-based, Distance Inference Framework for the Next Generation of Type Ia Supernova Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present EDRIS (French for Distance Estimator for Incomplete Supernova Surveys), a cosmological inference framework tailored to reconstruct unbiased cosmological distances from type Ia supernovae light-curve parameters. This goal is achieved by including data truncation directly in the statistical model which takes care of the standardization of luminosity distances. It allows us to build a single-step distance estimate by maximizing the corresponding likelihood, free from the biases the survey detection limits would introduce otherwise. Moreover, we expect the current worldwide statistics to be multiplied by O(10) in the upcoming years. This provides a new challenge to handle as the cosmological analysis must stay computationally towable. We show that the optimization methods used in EDRIS allow for a reasonable time complexity of O($N^2$) resulting in a very fast inference process (O(10s) for 1500 supernovae).</description>

      <title>Sub-Horizon Amplification of Curvature Perturbations: A New Route to Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhanced primordial scalar power spectrum is a widely studied mechanism for generating primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), also referred to as scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). This process also plays a pivotal role in facilitating the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Traditionally, the ultra slow-roll (USR) mechanism has been the predominant approach used in the early universe. In this framework, the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$, is typically set to $-6$ or lower for a brief period -- marking a significant departure from the standard slow-roll condition where $\epsilon_2 \simeq 0$. Such conditions often emerge in models with inflection points or localized features, such as bumps in the potential. In this paper, we challenge the conventional assumption that $\epsilon_2 \lesssim -6$ is a prerequisite for substantial amplification of the scalar power spectrum. We demonstrate that any negative value of the second slow-roll parameter can indeed enhance the scalar power spectrum through sub-horizon growth, establishing this as a necessary and sufficient condition for amplification. Consequently, this mechanism facilitates the generation of both PGWs and PBHs. To illustrate this, we examine a standard scenario where a brief USR phase is embedded between two slow-roll (SR) phases. By systematically varying $\epsilon_{2}$ values from $-1$ to $-10$ in the USR region, we investigate the amplification of the power spectrum and its implications for PGWs and PBHs production, particularly in the context of ongoing and future cosmological missions.</description>

      <title>Increase of $n_s$ in regularized pole inflation &amp; Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the regularization of the second order pole in the pole inflation can induce the increase of $n_s$, which may be important after the latest data release of cosmic microwave background (CMB) observation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Pole inflation is known to provide a unified description of attractor models that they can generate a flat plateau for inflation given a general potential. Recent ACT observation suggests that the constraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ at CMB scale may be shifted to a larger value than the predictions in the Starobinsky model, the Higgs inflation, and the $\alpha$-attractor model, which motivates us to consider the modification of the pole inflation. We find that if we regularize the second order pole in the kinetic term such that the kinetic term becomes regular for all field range, we can generally increase $n_s$ because the potential in the large field regime will be lifted. We have explicitly demonstrated that this type of regularized pole inflation can naturally arise from the Einstein-Cartan formalism, and the inflationary predictions are consistent with the latest ACT data without spoiling the success of the $\alpha$-attractor models.</description>

      <title>Optimal intrinsic alignment estimators in the presence of redshift-space distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present estimators for quantifying intrinsic alignments in large spectroscopic surveys that efficiently capture line-of-sight (LOS) information while being relatively insensitive to redshift-space distortions (RSD). We demonstrate that changing the LOS integration range, {\Pi}max, as a function of transverse separation outperforms the conventional choice of a single {\Pi}max value. This is further improved by replacing the flat {\Pi}max cut with a LOS weighting based on shape projection and RSD. Although these estimators incorporate additional LOS information, they are projected correlations that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios comparable to 3D correlation functions, such as the IA quadrupole. Using simulations from Abacus Summit, we evaluate these estimators and provide recommended {\Pi}max values and weights for projected separations of 1 - 100 Mpc/h. These will improve measurements of intrinsic alignments in large cosmological surveys and the constraints they provide for both weak lensing and direct cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter search from terrestrial magnetic fields at extremely low frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07559v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural environment of the Earth can act as a sensitive detector for dark matter in ultralight axions. When axions with masses between $1\times10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}$ and $1\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ pass through the Earth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range ($0.3$--$30\,{\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a series of companion papers for~\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data analysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the theoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we analyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this frequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65 persistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3. Aside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon coupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by at most two orders of magnitude down to $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13} \,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars offer powerful astrophysical laboratories to probe the properties of dark matter. Gradual accumulation of heavy, non-annihilating dark matter in neutron stars can lead to the formation of comparable-mass black holes, and non-detection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass black holes can constrain such dark matter interactions with nucleons. These constraints, though dependent on the currently uncertain binary neutron star merger rate density, are significantly more stringent than those from direct detection experiments and provide some of the strongest limits on heavy, non-annihilating dark matter interactions. Additionally, dark matter with baryon number-violating interactions can induce excess heating in cold neutron stars and is thus significantly constrained by thermal observations of cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The (Limited) Effect of Viscosity in Multiphase Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphase gas can be found in many astrophysical environments, such as galactic outflows, stellar wind bubbles, and the circumgalactic medium, where the interplay between turbulence, cooling, and viscosity can significantly influence gas dynamics and star formation processes. We investigate the role of viscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts of viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence evolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D numerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the KHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach numbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the impact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different cooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected dependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show different behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling regime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking previously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence (albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong cooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales, key scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which must hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the system effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of viscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of observational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves and Laboratory Searches as Complementary Probes of Right-handed Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the damping of inflationary gravitational waves (GW) that re-enter the Hubble horizon before or during a post-inflationary era dominated by a meta-stable, right-handed neutrino (RHN), whose out-of-equilibrium decay releases entropy. Within a minimal type-I seesaw extension of the Standard Model (SM), we explore the conditions under which the population of thermally produced RHNs remain long-lived and cause a period of matter-domination. We find that the suppression of the GW spectrum occurs above a characteristic frequency determined by the RHN mass and active-sterile mixing. For RHN masses in the range $0.1$ - $10$ GeV and mixing $10^{-12} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-5}$, we estimate such characteristic frequencies and the signal-to-noise ratio to assess the detection prospects in GW observatories such as THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, LISA, BBO and ET. We find complementarity between GW signals and laboratory searches in SHiP, DUNE and LEGEND-1000. Notably, RHN masses of $0.2$ - $2$ GeV and mixing $10^{-10} \lesssim |V_{eN}|^2 \lesssim 10^{-7}$ are testable in both laboratory experiments and GW observations. Additionally, GW experiments can probe the canonical seesaw regime of light neutrino mass generation, a region largely inaccessible to laboratory searches.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray neutrons in magnetized astrophysical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are often modeled as charged particles. This allows their non-ballistic propagation in magnetized structures to be captured. In certain situations, a neutral cosmic ray component can arise. For example, cosmic ray neutrons are produced in considerable numbers through hadronic pp and p$\gamma$ interactions. At ultrahigh energies, the decay timescales of these neutrons is dilated, allowing them to traverse distances on the scale of galactic and cosmological structures. Unlike charged cosmic rays, neutrons are not deflected by magnetic fields. They propagate ballistically at the speed of light in straight lines. The presence of a neutral baryonic cosmic ray component formed in galaxies, clusters and cosmological filaments can facilitate the escape and leakage of cosmic rays from magnetic structures that would otherwise confine them. We show that, by allowing confinement breaking, the formation of cosmic-ray neutrons by high-energy hadronic interactions in large scale astrophysical structures can modify the exchange of ultra high-energy particles across magnetic interfaces between galaxies, clusters, cosmological filaments and voids.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of large-scale structure, galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) can be probed by upcoming Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiments, which sample in redshift and direction without needing to resolve individual galaxies. We predict the intensity and sources of hydrogen H$\alpha$ emission, dominated by radiative recombination following ionization by UV from the same massive stars that caused reionization, down to redshift 4.6, using the largest fully-coupled, radiation-hydro simulation of galaxy formation and reionization to date, Cosmic Dawn (CoDa) III. We compute the mean intensity and Voxel Intensity Distribution (VID) vs. redshift, including the relative contributions of galaxies and IGM. This will provide mock data to guide and interpret LIM experiments such as NASA's SPHEREx and proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM).</description>

      <title>Density Profiles of TNG300 Voids across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present radial density profiles, as traced by luminous galaxies and dark matter particles, for voids in eleven snapshots of the \texttt{TNG300} simulation. The snapshots span 11.65~Gyr of cosmic time, corresponding to the redshift range $0 \le z \le 3$. Using the comoving galaxy fields, voids were identified via a well-tested, watershed transformation-based algorithm. Voids were defined to be underdense regions that are unlikely to have arisen from Poisson noise, resulting in the selection of $\sim100-200$ of the largest underdense regions in each snapshot. At all redshifts, the radial density profiles as traced by both the galaxies and the dark matter resemble inverse top-hat functions. However, details of the functions (particularly the underdensities of the innermost regions and the overdensities of the ridges) evolve considerably more for the dark matter density profiles than for the galaxy density profiles. At all redshifts, a linear relationship between the galaxy and dark matter density profiles exists, and the slope of the relationship is similar to the bias estimates for \texttt{TNG300} snapshots. Lastly, we identify distinct environments in which voids can exist, defining ``void-in-void" and ``void-in-cloud" populations (i.e., voids that reside in larger underdense or overdense regions, respectively) and we investigate ways in which the relative densities of dark matter and galaxies in the interiors and ridges of these structures vary as a function of void environment.</description>

      <title>A Massive Gas Outflow Outside the Line-of-Sight: Imaging Polarimetry of the Blue Excess Hot Dust Obscured Galaxy W0204-0506</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Aims) Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous, heavily obscured quasars. Although nuclear obscurations close to Compton-thick are typical, a fraction show blue UV spectral energy distributions consistent with unobscured quasar activity, albeit two orders of magnitude fainter than expected from their mid-IR luminosity. The origin of the UV emission in these Blue excess Hot DOGs (BHDs) has been linked to scattered light from the central engine. Here we study the properties of the UV emission in the BHD WISE J020446.13-050640.8 (W0204-0506). (Methods) We use imaging polarization observations in the $R_{\rm Special}$ band obtained with the FORS2 instrument at VLT. We compare these data with radiative transfer simulations to constrain the characteristics of the scattering material. (Results) We find a spatially integrated polarization fraction of $24.7\pm 0.7$%, confirming the scattered-light nature of the UV emission of W0204-0506. The source is spatially resolved in the observations and we find a gradient in polarization fraction and angle that is aligned with the extended morphology of the source found in HST/WFC3 imaging. A dusty, conical polar outflow starting at the AGN sublimation radius with a half-opening angle $\lesssim 50~\rm deg$ viewed at an inclination $\gtrsim 45~\rm deg$ can reproduce the observed polarization fraction if the dust is graphite-rich. We find that the gas mass and outflow velocity are consistent with the range of values found for [OIII] outflows through spectroscopy in other Hot DOGs, though it is unclear whether the outflow is energetic enough to affect the long-term evolution of the host galaxy. Our study highlights the unique potential for polarization imaging to study dusty quasar outflows, providing complementary constraints to those obtained through traditional spectroscopic studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New data from ongoing galaxy surveys, such as the $Euclid$ satellite and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are expected to unveil physics on the largest scales of our universe. Dramatically affected by cosmic variance, these scales are of interest to large-scale structure studies as they exhibit relevant corrections due to general relativity (GR) in the $n$-point statistics of cosmological random fields. We focus on the relativistic, sample-dependent Doppler contribution to the observed clustering of galaxies, whose detection will further confirm the validity of GR in cosmological regimes. Sample- and scale-dependent, the Doppler term is more likely to be detected via cross-correlation measurements, where it acts as an imaginary correction to the power spectrum of fluctuations in galaxy number counts. We present a method allowing us to exploit multi-tracer benefits from a single data set, by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples, according to galaxies' luminosity/magnitude. To overcome cosmic variance we rely on a multi-tracer approach, and to maximise the detectability of the relativistic Doppler contribution in the data, we optimise sample selection. As a result, we find the optimal split and forecast the relativistic Doppler detection significance for both a DESI-like Bright Galaxy Sample and a $Euclid$-like H$\alpha$ galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Approximating non-Gaussian Bayesian partitions with normalising flows: statistics, inference and application to cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subject of this paper is the simplification of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as used in Bayesian statistical inference by means of normalising flows, a machine learning method which is able to construct an invertible and differentiable transformation between Gaussian and non-Gaussian random distributions. We use normalising flows to compute Bayesian partition functions for non-Gaussian distributions and show how normalising flows can be employed in finding analytical expressions for posterior distributions beyond the Gaussian limit. Flows offer advantages for the numerical evaluation of the partition function itself, as well as for cumulants and for the information entropy. We demonstrate how normalising flows in conjunction with Bayes partitions can be used in inference problems in cosmology and apply them to the posterior distribution for the matter density $\Omega_m$ and a dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ on the basis of supernova data.</description>

      <title>Measuring the redshift-space distortions by cross-correlating the density fields before and after reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical model for the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density field before and after standard baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction. Using this model, we extract the redshift-space distortion (RSD) parameter from the cross-power spectrum. The model is validated against a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Deeper multi-redshift upper limits on the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal power spectrum from LOFAR between z=8.3 and z=10.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1, \text{ and } 8.3$, based on reprocessed observations from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). The analysis incorporates significant enhancements in calibration methods, sky model subtraction, radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, and an improved signal separation technique using machine learning to develop a physically motivated covariance model for the 21-cm signal. These advancements have markedly reduced previously observed excess power due to residual systematics, bringing the measurements closer to the theoretical thermal noise limit across the entire $k$-space. Using comparable observational data, we achieve a 2 to 4-fold improvement over our previous LOFAR limits, with best upper limits of $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (68.7\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (54.3\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.076\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta_{21}^2 &lt; (65.5\,\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k = 0.083\,h\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z \approx 10.1, 9.1$, and $8.3$, respectively. These new multi-redshift upper limits provide new constraints that can be used to refine our understanding of the astrophysical processes during the EoR. Comprehensive validation tests, including signal injection, were performed to ensure the robustness of our methods. The remaining excess power is attributed to residual foreground emissions from distant sources, beam model inaccuracies, and low-level RFI. We discuss ongoing and future improvements to the data processing pipeline aimed at further reducing these residuals, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of LOFAR observations in the quest to detect the 21-cm signal from the EoR.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 Orbital History: Did the Local Group evolve in isolation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use new measurements of the M31 proper motion to examine the Milky Way (MW) - M31 orbit and angular momentum. For Local Group (LG) mass consistent with measured values, and assuming the system evolves in isolation, we show a wide range of orbits is possible. We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in the Illustris simulation and find that $\sim 13\%$ of these pairs have undergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how accurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show that $\sim 10\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an orbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a lower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z \approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular momentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly explained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet recent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated two-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a major merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annual Modulation Analysis with Combined Nuclear and Electron Recoil Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After decades of experimental efforts, the DAMA/LIBRA(DL) annual modulation (AM) analysis on the $\chi N$ (WIMP Dark Matter interactions on nucleus) channel remains the only one which can be interpreted as positive signatures. This has been refuted by numerous time-integrated (TI) and AM analysis. It has been shown that $\chi e$ (WIMP interactions with electrons) alone is not compatible with the DL AM data. We expand the investigations by performing an AM analysis with the addition of $\chi e$ long-range and short-range interactions to $\chi N$, derived using the Frozen Core Approximation method. Two scenarios are considered, where the $\chi N$ and $\chi e$ processes are due to a single $\chi$ ($\Gamma^{1 \chi}_{tot}$) or two different $\chi$'s ($\Gamma^{2 \chi}_{tot}$). The combined fits with $\chi N$ and $\chi e$ provide stronger significance to the DL AM data which are compatible with the presence of additional physical effects beyond $\chi N$ alone. This is the first analysis which explores how $\chi e$ AM can play a role in DL AM. The revised allowed regions as well as the exclusion contours from the other null AM experiments are presented. All DL AM allowed parameter spaces in $\chi N$ and $\chi e$ channels under both $\Gamma^{1 \chi}_{tot}$ and $\Gamma^{2 \chi}_{tot}$ are excluded at the 90\% confidence level by the combined null AM results. It can be projected that DL-allowed parameter spaces from generic models with interactions induced by two-WIMPs are ruled out.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Particle Flux in a Dynamically Self-consistent Milky Way Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed dynamically self-consistent model of the Milky Way constrained by observations from the Gaia observatory to include a radially anisotropic component in the dark matter (DM) halo, which represents the debris from the accreted Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) galaxy. In the new model, which we call a self-consistent Anisotropic Halo Model or scAHM, we derive distribution functions for DM velocity in heliocentric and geocentric reference frames. We compare them with the velocity distributions in the standard halo model (SHM) and another anisotropic model (SHM++). We compute predicted scattering rates in direct-detection experiments, for different target nuclei and DM particle masses. Seasonal dependencies of scattering rates are analyzed, revealing small but interesting variations in detection rates for different target nuclei and DM masses. Our findings show that the velocity distribution of the anisotropic GSE component significantly deviates from Gaussian, showing a modest impact on the detection rates. The peculiar kinematic signature of the radially anisotropic component would be most clearly observable by direction-sensitive detectors.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognised earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>
