      <title>Precise Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurements of a star's radial velocity (RV) made using extremely stable, high resolution, optical or near infrared spectrographs can be used to determine the masses and orbital parameters of gravitationally-bound extra-solar planets (exoplanets). Indeed, RV surveys and follow up efforts have provided the vast majority of published exoplanet mass measurements and in doing so have enabled studies into exoplanet interior and atmospheric compositions. Here we review the current state of the RV field, with particular attention paid to:
  -The evolution of precise RV methodologies over the past two decades
  -Modern RV spectrograph designs that can be calibrated to a stability level of better than 50 cm/s over timescales of years
  -RV data reduction and post-processing techniques that minimize the impact of instrument systematics and stellar variability
  -Techniques for detecting exoplanets in RV data and disentangling planetary signals from stellar variability</description>

      <title>The interstellar flux gap: From dust to kilometer-scale objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Three kilometer-sized interstellar objects (ISOs) have been detected transiting the Solar System, and spacecraft have directly measured micrometer-scale interstellar dust (ISD). Yet no intermediate-size interstellar meteoroids have been identified in current meteor surveys.
  Aims. We test whether a power-law flux extrapolation connecting spacecraft ISD and kilometer-scale ISOs is consistent with meteor surveys, and we quantify the expected interstellar impacting flux based on various observational reports.
  Methods. We compiled differential fluxes and limits from spacecraft ISD, radar and optical meteor surveys, and theoretical estimates. We evaluated the power-law size-frequency fits, computed the 3I-like flux, and compared measured fluxes to predictions.
  Results. The spacecraft-measured dust flux exceeds extrapolations constrained by meteor surveys and kilometer-scale ISOs by $\sim$2-7 orders of magnitude. An $r^{-3.0}$ fit combining spacecraft ISD detections with kilometer-scale ISOs overpredicts the number of meteors with hyperbolic orbits, whereas slopes of $r^{-2.7}$-$r^{-2.3}$ (derived from radar and optical meteor upper limits, respectively) instead yield interplanetary-to-interstellar flux ratios of $10^{3}$-$10^{6}$.
  Conclusions. A simple power-law from ISD to ISOs is inconsistent with meteor survey constraints and yields unrealistic predictions for interstellar meteoroids. The data reveal a gap between submicron dust entrained in the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and macroscopic bodies ejected from planetary systems. This gap may reflect distinct origins and destruction-transport processes rather than a continuous size-frequency distribution. This would imply either the dominance of a small-particle LIC component or the need to reassess spacecraft dust fluxes.</description>

      <title>Inferring the physics of protoplanetary disc evolution from the irradiated Cygnus OB2 region -- A comparison of viscous and MHD wind-driven scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our current understanding has crystallised around two possible evolution scenarios for protoplanetary discs (turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven) - but which dominates remains uncertain. Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dust back-reaction on gas around planets modifies the cold thermal torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nascent planet in a gas disk experiences radial migration due to the different torques which act on it. It has recently been shown that the torques produced by the gas and dust density variations around a non-accreting low-mass planet, the so-called cold thermal and dust streaming torques, can surpass each of the other torque components. We investigate how the total torque acting on the planet is affected by the presence of dust grains and their aerodynamic back-reaction on gas, while taking into account the cold thermal torque produced by thermal diffusion in the gas component. We perform high-resolution local and global three-dimensional two-fluid simulations within the pressureless-fluid dust approximation using the Fargo3D code. We explore the influence of different dust species parameterized by the Stokes number, focusing on non-accreting protoplanets with masses from one-third the mass of Mars to one Earth mass. The dust feedback has substantial impact on the asymmetry of the cold thermal lobes (which produce the cold thermal torque). However, the total torque is dominated by the dust torque when St $&gt;10^{-2}$. The dust torque becomes more negative over time due to the formation of dust lobes that resemble the cold thermal lobes that form in the gas component. Therefore, the dust streaming torque prevails over the cold thermal torque. On the other hand, when St $\leq10^{-2}$, the dust streaming torque is negligible and thus, the total torque on the planet comes from the gaseous component of the disk. Our results suggest that a planet embedded in a gas-dust disk may experience stagnant migration or inward runaway migration in regions of the protoplanetary disk where the dust is not fully coupled to the gas. However, this behaviour could change in regions with strong dust-gas coupling or in the inner transition region of the disk, where the cold thermal torque may become relevant.</description>

      <title>ExoplaNeT accRetion mOnitoring sPectroscopic surveY (ENTROPY) - II. Time series of Balmer line profiles of Delorme 1(AB)b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion processes in the planetary-mass regime remain poorly constrained, yet they strongly influence planet formation, evolution, and the composition of circumplanetary disks (CPDs). We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen emission-line profiles and their variability in the ~13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old companion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using VLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680 nm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape and flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two proposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion shocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV continuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are variable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary only in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV excess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but not with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The narrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched by shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes show low variability on hour timescales but up to ~100% over weeks, similar to T Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of the broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or chromospheric activity. Higher-cadence observations could reveal rotational modulations and help constrain the object's rotation period and accretion geometry.</description>

      <title>A JWST Transit of a Jupiter Analog I: Constraints on the Oblateness of Kepler-167e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline ("katahdin") and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f&lt;0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f&lt;0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.</description>

      <title>The First Occurrence Rate Estimates for Exoplanets in Small-Separation Binary Star Systems: Planet Occurrence is Suppressed in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet occurrence rates facilitate comparisons between observations of planets and theoretical models of planet formation. Despite their deductive power, exoplanet occurrence rates for half the stars in the sky are missing because occurrence rate studies systematically exclude binary star systems. We assembled a large sample of high-likelihood binaries from the Kepler mission to calculate occurrence rates for circumstellar (S-type) planets in small-separation binary star systems ($\lesssim 100$ au) for the first time. For a sample of high-likelihood small-separation binaries, we found binaries to host 58% fewer planets per system than single stars to 11.4$\sigma$ significance within 1-4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-50 d, and 50% fewer planets compared to single stars when integrating over the full parameter space of 1-10 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-100 d to 3.8$\sigma$ significance.. We found no evidence for a radius valley or radius cliff, instead detecting a smooth decline in planet occurrence with increasing planetary radius. The difference between the single-star planet radius distribution and the binary-star planet radius distribution is 4.3$\sigma$ significant from a Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. These results suggest significantly different planet formation and survival outcomes in binaries compared to single stars, and support other studies that have measured a deficit of observed planets in binary star systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regain of interest in Moon exploration has substantially grown in the last years. For this reason, the space agencies consider the development of a precise navigation and positioning service similar to the Earth GNSS. Aiming at some meter accuracy, this requires to set up a relativistic lunar reference frame, with an associated coordinate time. If the IAU already defined the Lunar Coordinate Time TCL, there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be adopted as reference on or around the Moon. This paper proposes a trade-off analysis of different possible options for this reference time scale. It shows that TCL is the best option to be used as practical time reference on the Moon, without the need to define a new time scale based on a scaling of TCL.</description>

      <title>From thermal to magnetic driving: spectral diagnostics of simulation-based magnetothermal disc wind models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc winds driven by thermal and magnetic processes are thought to play a critical role in protoplanetary disc evolution. However, the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of their observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved emission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally and magnetically driven winds in protoplanetary discs. We modelled three disc wind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly magnetised wind ($\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\beta$6), and a purely photoevaporative wind (PE). Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generated synthetic emission maps and line profiles for [OI] 6300 \r{A}, [NeII] 12.81 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and o-H2 2.12 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and compared them with observations. The $\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more blueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact emission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\beta$6 and PE models yield narrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most observed narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line profile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are not robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable constraints. The $\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs in observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the $\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most observed NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative flows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers meaningful constraints on wind-driving physics.</description>

      <title>Computing the Full Earth System at 1 km Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at \qty{1.25}{\kilo\meter} grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy, water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere, ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of \num{8192} GPUs on Alps and \num{20480} GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar resolution.</description>

      <title>The nature of ASASSN-24fw's occultation: modelling the event as dimming by optically thick rings around a sub-stellar companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.</description>

      <title>A substellar flyby that shaped the orbits of the giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modestly eccentric and non-coplanar orbits of the giant planets pose a challenge to solar system formation theories which generally indicate that the giant planets emerged from the protoplanetary disk in nearly perfectly circular and coplanar orbits. We demonstrate that a single encounter with a 2-50 Jupiter-mass object, passing through the solar system at a perihelion distance less than 20 AU and a hyperbolic excess velocity of 1-3 km/s, can excite the giant planets' eccentricities and mutual inclinations to values comparable to those observed. We describe a metric to evaluate how closely a simulated flyby system matches the eccentricity and inclination secular modes of the solar system. We estimate that there is about a 1-in-9000 chance that such a flyby occurs during the solar system's residence in its primordial cluster and produces a dynamical architecture similar to that of the solar system. The scenario of an ancient close encounter with a substellar object offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the moderate eccentricities and inclinations and the secular architecture of the planets. We discuss some broader implications of disruptive flyby encounters on planetary systems in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>High CO/H2 ratios supports an exocometary origin for a CO-rich debris disk</title>

Abstract: Over 20 exocometary belts host detectable circumstellar gas, mostly in the form of CO. Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $&gt; 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $&gt; 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $&lt;10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.</description>

      <title>Data availability and requirements relevant for the Ariel space mission and other exoplanet atmosphere applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this white paper is to provide a snapshot of the data availability and data needs primarily for the Ariel space mission, but also for related atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It covers the following data-related topics: molecular and atomic line lists, line profiles, computed cross-sections and opacities, collision-induced absorption and other continuum data, optical properties of aerosols and surfaces, atmospheric chemistry, UV photodissociation and photoabsorption cross-sections, and standards in the description and format of such data. These data aspects are discussed by addressing the following questions for each topic, based on the experience of the "data-provider" and "data-user" communities: (1) what are the types and sources of currently available data, (2) what work is currently in progress, and (3) what are the current and anticipated data needs. We present a GitHub platform for Ariel-related data, with the goal to provide a go-to place for both data-users and data-providers, for the users to make requests for their data needs and for the data-providers to link to their available data. Our aim throughout the paper is to provide practical information on existing sources of data whether in databases, theoretical, or literature sources.</description>
