      <title>Direct power spectral density estimation from structure functions without Fourier transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order structure functions and power spectral densities are popular tools in the study of statistical properties across scales, particularly for the analysis of turbulent flows. Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electrohydrodynamics of a surfactant-laden leaky dielectric drop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear three-dimensional small-deformation theory is presented for a leaky dielectric drop coated with a dilute monolayer of insoluble apolar surfactant and subjected to a uniform DC electric field. The theory is developed within the framework of the Taylor--Melcher leaky dielectric model, and builds on previous work by retaining surface charge convection in the charge conservation equation. Solving the problem in three dimensions and retaining charge convection allows us to capture the transition to Quincke rotation, a symmetry breaking instability wherein a drop begins rotating at a steady angular velocity when the applied electric field strength exceeds a critical value. We derive a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the drop shape, dipole moment, and surfactant distribution, which we solve numerically. We discuss the combined effects of charge convection and surfactant in the Taylor regime -- in which the field strength is too weak to induce Quincke rotation and the drop adopts an axisymmetric spheroidal shape. In the Quincke regime, we find that the presence of a weakly-diffusing surfactant results in a lower critical electric field than that for a drop with uniform surfactant coverage. Varying the elasticity number, which quantifies the variation of the surface tension as a function of the surfactant concentration, can either increase or decrease the critical field strength depending on the diffusivity of the surfactant. Additionally, we find that the experimentally observed hysteresis in the angular velocity of the drop can disappear when surfactant diffusion is sufficiently weak.</description>

      <title>An effective correction method for droplet volume conservation in direct numerical simulation of droplet-laden turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately preserving the volume of the dispersed droplets remains a significant challenge in phase-field simulations of droplet-laden turbulence, especially under conditions that feature strong interfacial deformation and breakup. While modified phase-field equations have been developed to mitigate volume loss, their effectiveness has not been systematically assessed in the context of fully developed turbulent flows. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of several representative volume-corrected phase-field models in direct numerical simulations of droplet-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our results reveal that, at sufficiently high Weber numbers, none of the existing models provides satisfactory droplet-volume preservation. To address this limitation, we then propose a simple yet effective modification of the conservataive Allen-Cahn equation by incorporating a curvature-dependent counter-diffusion correction. Direct numerical simulations in turbulent regimes demonstrate that the proposed model achieves conservation of droplet volume in a statistical sense, while avoiding common adverse effects, such as numerical instability, violation of global mass conservation, increased computational cost, artificial coarsening, or enhanced spurious velocities.</description>

      <title>Impulse-induced liquid jets from bubbles with arbitrary contact angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the contact angle of a spherical bubble attached to a tube submerged in a container and the jet speed induced by an impulsive acceleration at its base. While it has been well established that bubble geometry strongly influences the ejection speeds of liquid jets, mathematical studies of liquid jets with arbitrary bubble shapes remain limited. In this work, we derive a pressure impulse in the small-cavity limit as a tractable integral of classical Legendre functions. It is shown that the jet speed can be divided into two components: (i) the velocity induced by the hydrostatic pressure impulse distribution created by the curvature of the bubble, and (ii) the velocity induced by the distribution of the submersion of the tube in a container. This decomposition reveals that an optimal bubble curvature emerges only when the tube is submerged: the optimality is absent for non-submerged configurations, where the jet speed increases monotonically with bubble depth. Experiments confirm this non-monotonicity and quantitatively support the predicted shift of the optimal geometry with submersion depth.</description>

      <title>Causal structures of turbulent skin-friction drag in wall-bounded turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of turbulent skin-friction drag (TSD) generation is of fundamental and practical importance for designing effective drag reduction strategies. However, many previous studies adopted correlation analysis to reveal the causal map between turbulent motions and TSD generation, an approach that is potentially risky as correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In this study, a novel causal inference method called Liang-Kleeman information flow (LKIF) is utilized for the first time to identify the velocity-induced causal structures related to TSD generation in a turbulent channel flow. The statistical properties of the causal structures are comprehensively investigated. The positive and negative causal structures, defined by their signs and respectively associated with an increase and decrease in TSD information entropy, promote and suppress the generation of extreme TSD. Particularly, we find that the underlying physics of causal structures is essentially associated with the processes of streamwise streaks and rolls approaching or receding from the extreme events. Results indicate that the physics-informed LKIF framework can reveal a more explicit and interpretable causal relationship than correlation analysis.</description>

      <title>How Spontaneous Electrowetting and Surface Charge affect Drop Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water drops sliding on hydrophobic surfaces spontaneously separate charges at their rear. It is unclear how this charge separation affects the contact angles of a sliding drop. We slide grounded and insulated drops on hydrophobic surfaces at low capillary numbers (\leq 10^{-4}). We find that drop charge leads to spontaneous electrowetting, which decreases the contact angles. Additionally, the deposited charges lead to a surface charge effect and decrease the contact angle. Both phenomena compensate each other at the receding contact line, resulting in an insignificant change in the receding contact angle of a sliding drop.</description>

      <title>A comparison of different image analysis techniques for mapping spatiotemporal pH and carbon dissolution in density-driven convection of CO2 in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-driven convection enhances the carbon dissolution rate, which is significant for the geological carbon storage. This process will also influence the spatiotemporal pH and carbon concentrations of the underground fluid. To illuminate the convection mechanism, it is critical to understand the evolution of those properties within the porous media. However, determining the spatiotemporal pH and concentration within porous media is always challenging. This study employed a combination of three pH indicators that can track a wide range in pH from 4 to 9.5 in a convection experiment. Furthermore, we compared three image-processing techniques: Hue, gray-difference, and angular representation of RGB color space $\mathbf{(\phi,\theta)}$ for quantifying color changes from the universal $\text{pH}$ indicator arising from the carbon convection. The characterized colors were mapped into pH by calibrating against benchmark solutions. The comparative results demonstrate that the color quantified by the Hue technique is most robust, showing invariance to fluid thickness, camera settings, and LED luminance. In the convection experiments, it produces a continuous spatial distribution of pH and concentration level in the system. In contrast, the $\mathbf{(\phi,\theta)}$ and gray-difference techniques were more sensitive to environmental variations. They also have significant limitations for $\text{pH}$ interpolation in the critical range due to their non-monotonic calibration paths. Although all methods ultimately produced similar estimates of total dissolved carbon, the Hue technique offers greater stability and universality for high-resolution, dynamic measurements of pH and carbon concentration in the convection experiments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Roughness-Induced Transition on a Blunt Body at Mach 6: a Numerical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface roughness significantly impacts transition to turbulence, especially over high-speed, blunt geometries where surface ablation is necessary to mitigate heat loads during atmospheric entry. Inspired by sand-grain roughness experiments performed by Hollis (2017), we perform the first direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a blunt cylinder in Mach 6 cross-flow with roughness elements distributed along the entire surface. Such simulations aimed to uncover the precise means by which laminar-turbulent transition occurs given the limited measurements attainable from experiments and non-existent high-fidelity simulations. Element heights were held fixed at approximately 35% boundary layer thickness, while the relative phasing between streamwise rows was varied. All configurations exhibited convective instabilities driving the transition process, with the mode type being set by the roughness configuration. A fundamental sinuous streak mode dominated the aligned roughness element case, whereas both the staggered and randomly phased cases saw 2D T-S waves dominating. These instability waves, when grown to sufficient amplitude, triggered the steady streaks seeded by the underlying roughness pattern to begin forming hairpin vortices and breakdown occurred soon thereafter. The roughness arrangement was found to dramatically influence the degree to which the waves were destabilised, as well as the strength of the underlying steady streaks, thereby combining to dictate the position along the surface where LTT occurred. Finally, exogeneous forcing was not required for the T-S dominated cases as the acoustics generated by the turbulence in the subsonic flow excited T-S waves on the other side - a feedback mechanism hitherto unknown.</description>

      <title>Tracking stall cell dynamics at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spanwise organization of the flow over a thick airfoil is investigated using surface pressure measurements for a range of angles of attack around maximum lift and high Reynolds numbers (1 Million). Locally strong pressure fluctuations, which are not detected in the global lift coefficient, are shown to be associated with the presence of a stall cell. The stall cell width is of the order of the chord length and increases linearly with the angle of attack, with a weak dependence on the Reynolds number. Its dynamics at Reynolds numbers larger than 1 Million is dominated by a coherent motion in the spanwise direction with a characteristic velocity of order tenth of the freestream velocity. The motion can be decomposed into a large-scale, low-frequency sweep with a Strouhal number equal to 0.001 combined with faster, smaller-scale oscillations. The coherence of the stall cell makes it possible to track global dynamics from local measurements.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic Flow Control: Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hypersonic Intake Unstart Control under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A space-time LATIN-PGD strategy for solving Newtonian compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating flow problems is at the core of many engineering applications but often requires high computational effort, especially when dealing with complex models. This work presents a novel approach for resolving flow problems using the LATIN-PGD solver. In this contribution, we place ourselves within the framework of Newtonian compressible and laminar flows. This specific and relatively simple case enables focusing on flows for which a state equation provides a direct relation between pressure and density. It is then possible to use the LATIN solver to set up a pressure-velocity decoupling algorithm. Moreover, Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is natively included in the solver and yields two independent space-time decompositions for the velocity and the pressure fields. As a first step, the solver is validated on a problem for which an analytical solution is available. It is then applied to slightly more complex problems. The results show good agreement with the literature, and we expect that the solver could be used to compute more complicated material laws in the future.</description>

      <title>Koopman Autoencoders with Continuous-Time Latent Dynamics for Fluid Dynamics Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating the simulation of turbulent flows. However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting. We evaluate the approach on classical CFD benchmarks and report accuracy, stability, and extrapolation properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamic similarity of vortex shedding in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate wake dynamics in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle. Unlike an impenetrable object, a penetrable obstacle does not fully deplete the density. We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size.</description>

      <title>Point Vortex Dynamics on Closed Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.</description>

Abstract: Multiphase flows where particles, bubbles, or droplets are suspended in a fluid govern critical processes in biology, medicine, materials processing, and geophysics. However, observing their microscale dynamics in opaque systems has remained a fundamental challenge. We present Synchrotron X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel approach enabling four-dimensional (3D+time) tracking of microparticles in dense suspension flows without requiring sample rotation. By capturing simultaneous projections from multiple angles using beam-split X-rays at synchrotron facilities, we resolve instantaneous particle positions and trajectories in opaque fluids such as blood. We demonstrate the potential of XMPI through individual particle tracking velocimetry (3D PTV) in dilute conditions, as well as multi-projection optical flow analysis in dense suspensions. The methodology provides otherwise inaccessible experimental validation for particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics models and allows, e.g., observation of inertial focusing effects and microstructural dynamics relevant to suspension rheology and biomedical flows. This work paves the way for high-resolution, time-resolved 4D imaging of complex multiphase flows across a range of scientific and industrial applications. Combining XMPI with recent AI-supported 4D reconstruction algorithms opens a new spatiotemporal frontier for high-speed, rotation-free microtomography.</description>

      <title>Slip and friction at fluid-solid interfaces: Concept of adsorption layer</title>

Abstract: When a fluid flows past a solid surface, its macroscopic motion arises from a subtle interplay between microscopic hydrodynamic and thermodynamic effects at the fluid-solid interface. Classical hydrodynamic models often rely on an unphysical no-slip boundary condition or an arbitrarily prescribed slip length, yet both approaches lack a rigorous physical foundation. This work introduces the concept of an Adsorption Layer (AL), an interfacial region of thickness delta l, where fluid-solid molecular interactions regulate both surface adsorption/depletion and interfacial slip. By applying the energy minimization principle, we derive balance equations within the AL that couple fluid-solid friction, viscous stresses, and surface adsorption dynamics. This framework establishes a self-consistent thermodynamic coupling between the AL and the bulk fluid, unlike conventional sharp-interface models. A key finding is the often-overlooked role and coupling of pressure and chemical potential gradients in the direction normal to the interface. This theoretical advance successfully explains the confinement-induced enhancement of water slippage in carbon nanotubes, quantitatively agreeing with molecular dynamics and experimental data -- an effect classical slip models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, when extended to binary liquids, the theory captures spatial variations in slip velocity near moving contact lines, highlighting the role of interfacial friction in shaping local flow. Our results demonstrate that the slip length is not a fixed material constant but rather an emergent, geometry- and composition-dependent property arising from coupled interfacial thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. This framework provides a physically grounded description of interfacial momentum transfer, with significant implications for microfluidics and surface engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that perturbations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, raising the possibility that shear-driven turbulence may be found even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Drift towards isotropization during the 3D hydrodynamic turbulence onset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incompressible three-dimensional Euler equations develop very thin pancake-like regions of exponentially increasing vorticity. The characteristic thickness of such regions decreases exponentially with time, while the other two dimensions do not change considerably, making the flow near each pancake strongly anisotropic. The pancakes emerge in increasing number with time, which may enhance the anisotropy of the flow, especially if they orient similarly in space. In the present paper, we study numerically the anisotropy by analyzing the evolution of the so-called isotropy markers [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, L022602 (2025)]. We show that these functions drift slowly towards unity, indicating the process of slow isotropization, which takes place without the viscous scales getting exited and despite the similar orientation of the emerging pancakes.</description>

      <title>A reduced model for droplet dynamics with interfacial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the phenomenological Maffettone-Minale (MM) model (P.L. Maffettone and M. Minale, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech. 78, 227-241 (1998)) to describe the time-dependent deformation of a droplet with interfacial viscosity in a shear flow. The droplet, characterised by surface tension $\sigma$, is spherical at rest with radius $R$ and deforms into an ellipsoidal shape under a shear flow of rate $G$, described by a symmetric second-order morphological tensor $\boldsymbol{S}$. In addition to surface tension, the extended MM (EMM) model incorporates interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$, through the corresponding Boussinesq numbers $\mbox{Bq}_s=\mu_s/\mu R$ and $\mbox{Bq}_d=\mu_d/\mu R$, where $\mu$ is the bulk viscosity. A central goal of this work is to quantify the parameter range over which the EMM model provides a realistic description of droplet deformation, as a function of the capillary number Ca$=\mu R G/\sigma$ and the Boussinesq numbers. To this end, model predictions are systematically compared with fully resolved numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Inviscid Power-Law Vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13397v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the power-law vortex $\overline{\omega}(x) = \beta |x|^{-\alpha}$, which explicitly solves the stationary unforced incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in both physical and self-similar coordinates, is exponentially linearly stable in self-similar coordinates with the natural scaling. This result, which is valid for functions in a weighted $L^2$ space and in the un-weighted $L^2$ space with a mild symmetry condition, answers a question from the monograph by Albritton et al. Moreover, we prove that in physical coordinates the linearization around the power law vortex cannot generate an unstable $C_0$-semigroup.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascades in Driven Granular Liquids : A new Universality Class? I : Model and Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron-limit (HEL) closure for the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, known as the gyromoment (GM) approach. By expanding the gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio limit, {\tau} = Ti/Te &lt;&lt; 1, and retaining only the essential O({\tau}) terms, we obtain a closed system for the density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In a Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with the HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low collisionality dynamics. An extension to the tokamak-relevant s-{\alpha} geometry and a comparison with gyrokinetic simulations reveal the capabilities and limitations of the HEL-closed GM model: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at {\tau}=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents an accurate prediction of the Dimits shift and of transport suppression.</description>

      <title>PAINT: Parallel-in-time Neural Twins for Dynamical System Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. We argue, that a critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states in parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.</description>
