      <title>Generalized Canonical Polyadic Tensor Decompositions with General Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a workhorse algorithm for discovering underlying low-dimensional structure in tensor data. This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Optimal Damping in Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal damping aims at determining a vector of damping coefficients $\nu$ that maximizes the decay rate of a mechanical system's response. This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $\nu$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $\nu$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $\nu \ge 0$ with $\nu \ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.
  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Device Performance in Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to study the device performance of organic solar cells in silico. We introduce a mathematical model that includes the dynamics of excitons as well as their dissociation at bulk heterojunctions within the nanomorphology of the active layer. This is combined with realistic morphologies that we obtain from a detailed phase field model. To solve the coupled nonlinear system, we use a finite element discretization, robust linear solvers, and three numerical schemes, Newton, Gummel, and Semi--Newton--Gummel. This allows for an efficient simulation of the complete OPV device and results in current-voltage curves that can readily be compared to measured data.</description>

      <title>A semi-implicit DLN Galerkin finite element method for coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations with general nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the two-step discretization scheme proposed by Dahlquist, Liniger and Nevanlinna (DLN), we develop a semi-implicit Galerkin finite element method for solving the coupled generalized Ginzburg-Landau equations. By virtue of a novel analytical technique, the boundedness of the numerical solution in the infinity norm is established, upon which the unconditionally optimal error estimates in the $L^2$ and $H^1$-norms are further derived. Compared with the space-time error splitting technique commonly adopted in the literature, the analytical method proposed in this paper does not require the introduction of an additional temporal discretization system, thus greatly simplifying the theoretical argument. The core point of the argument lies in the skillful application of the inverse inequality and discrete Agmon inequality to analyze the two cases, namely $\tau \leq h$ and $\tau&gt;h$, respectively. Three numerical examples covering both two- and three-dimensional scenarios are eventually provided for the validation of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned log-determinant approximation: one Gaussian probe vector is almost always enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present randomized algorithms for estimating the log-determinant of regularized symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. The algorithms access the matrix only through matrix vector products, and are based on the introduction of a preconditioner and stochastic trace estimator. We claim that preconditioning as much as we can and making a rough estimate of the residual part with a small budget achieves a small error in most of the cases. We choose a Nystr\"om preconditioner and estimate the residual using only one sample of stochastic Lanczos quadrature (SLQ). We analyze the performance of this strategy from a theoretical and practical viewpoint. We also present an algorithm that, at almost no additional cost, detects whether the proposed strategy is not the most effective, in which case it uses more samples for the SLQ part. Numerical examples on several test matrices show that our proposed methods are competitive with existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence analysis of unconditionally original energy dissipative implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta methods for the phase field crystal models without Lipschitz assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase field crystal (PFC) method is an efficient technique for simulating the evolution of crystalline microstructures at atomistic length scales and diffusive time scales. Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Domain-of-dependence-stabilized cut-cell discretizations of linear kinetic models with summation-by-parts properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the summation-by-parts (SBP) framework to extend the recent domain-of-dependence (DoD) stabilization for cut cells to linear kinetic models in diffusion scaling. Numerical methods for these models are challenged by increased stiffness for small scaling parameters and the necessity of asymptotics preservation regarding a parabolic limit equation. As a prototype model, we consider the telegraph equation in one spatial dimension subject to periodic boundary conditions with an asymptotic limit given by the linear heat equation. We provide a general semidiscrete stability result for this model when spatially discretized by arbitrary periodic (upwind) SBP operators and formally prove that the fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving. Moreover, we prove that DoD with central numerical fluxes leads to periodic SBP operators. Furthermore, we show that adapting the upwind DoD scheme yields periodic upwind SBP operators. Consequently, the DoD stabilization possesses the desired properties considered in the first part of this work and thus leads to a stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for the telegraph equation. We back our theoretical results with numerical simulations and demonstrate the applicability of this cut-cell stabilization for implicit time integration in the heat equation limit.</description>

      <title>An unfitted finite element method for elliptic interface problem with low regularity estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and analyze an unfitted finite element method for the elliptic interface problem. We consider the case that the interface is $C^2$-smooth or polygonal, and the exact solution $u \in H^{1+s}(\Omega_0 \cup \Omega_1)$ for any $s &gt; 0$. The stability near the interface is guaranteed by a local polynomial extension technique combined with ghost penalty bilinear forms, from which the robust condition number estimates and the error estimates are derived. Furthermore, the jump penalty term for weakly enforcing the jump condition in our method is also defined based on the local polynomial extension, which enables us to establish the error estimation particularly for solutions with low regularity. We perform a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Learn to Evolve: Self-supervised Neural JKO Operator for Wasserstein Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A simpler and more efficient fixed point iterative scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work presents a new iterative scheme to approximate the fixed points of nonexpansive mapping. The proposed algorithm is constructed to enhance convergence efficiency while preserving theoretical robustness. Under appropriate assumptions on the underlying operator, we establish weak convergence and strong convergence results for the generated sequence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we present a numerical example and perform a detailed comparative study with several well-known iterative methods from the literature. The numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed method exhibits a faster rate of convergence than the existing schemes, thereby confirming its computational advantage. These findings suggest that the new iterative process provides an efficient and reliable alternative for solving fixed point problems arising in applied mathematics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Riemann curvature to Regge metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Riemann curvature tensor on manifolds (of dimension two or higher) endowed with a Regge metric. Specifically, while all components of the metric tensor are assumed to be smooth within elements of a triangulation of the manifold, they need not be smooth across element interfaces, where only continuity of the tangential components is assumed. While linear derivatives of the metric can be generalized to Schwartz distributions, similarly generalizing the classical Riemann curvature tensor, a nonlinear second-order derivative of the metric, requires more care. We propose a generalization that combines the classical angle defect and jumps in the second fundamental form across element interfaces, and argue its correctness. Specifically, if a piecewise smooth metric approximates a globally smooth metric, then our generalized Riemann curvature tensor approximates the classical Riemann curvature tensor associated with the latter. Moreover, we show that if the metric approximation converges at some rate in a mesh-dependent norm equivalent to the $L^2$ norm, then the curvature approximation converges in the negative Sobolev space $H^{-2}$, the dual space of $H^2_0$, at the same rate, under additional assumptions. By appropriate contractions of the generalized Riemann curvature tensor, this work also provides generalizations of scalar curvature, the Ricci curvature tensor, and the Einstein tensor in any dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of infinitely smooth multivariate kernel matrices when the nodes form a single cluster. We show that the geometry of the nodes plays an important role in the scaling of the eigenvalues of these kernel matrices. For the multivariate Dirichlet kernel matrix, we establish a criterion for the sampling set ensuring precise scaling of eigenvalues. Additionally, we identify specific sampling sets that satisfy this criterion. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the problem of super-resolution, i.e. stable recovery of sparse measures from bandlimited Fourier measurements.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) time discretization methods are very popular when solving stiff kinetic equations. In [21], an asymptotic analysis shows that a specific class of high-order IMEX-RK schemes can accurately capture the Navier-Stokes limit without needing to resolve the small scales dictated by the Knudsen number. In this work, we extend the asymptotic analysis to general IMEX-RK schemes, known in literature as Type I and Type II. We further suggest some IMEX-RK methods developed in the literature to attain uniform accuracy in the wide range of Knudsen numbers. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the validity of the obtained theoretical results and the effectiveness of the methods.</description>

      <title>Local cubic spline interpolation for Vlasov-type equations on a multi-patch geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-Lagrangian method for the numerical resolution of Vlasov-type equations on multi-patch meshes. Following N. Crouseilles et al. [A parallel Vlasov solver based on local cubic spline interpolation on patches. Journal of Computational Physics (2009)], we employ a local cubic spline interpolation with Hermite boundary conditions between the patches. The derivative reconstruction is adapted to cope with non-uniform meshes as well as non-conforming situations. In the conforming case, there are no longer any constraints on the number of points for each patch; however, a small global system must now be solved. In that case, the local spline representations coincide with the corresponding global spline reconstruction. Alternatively, we can choose not to apply the global system and the derivatives can be approximated. The influence of the most distant points diminishes as the number of points per patch increases. For uniform per patch configurations, a study of the explicit and asymptotic behavior of this influence has been led. The method is validated using a two-dimensional guiding-center model with an O-point. All the numerical results are carried out in the Gyselalib++ library.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Solving the Least-Squares Problem in Variational Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational data assimilation is a technique for combining measured data with dynamical models. It is a key component of Earth system state estimation and is commonly used in weather and ocean forecasting. The approach involves a large-scale generalized nonlinear least-squares problem. Solving the resulting sequence of sparse linear subproblems requires the use of sophisticated numerical linear algebra methods. In practical applications, the computational demands severely limit the number of iterations of a Krylov subspace solver that can be performed and so high-quality preconditioners are vital. In this paper, we present a numerical linear algebra perspective on variational data assimilation and discuss contemporary solution methods for the challenges posed by large-scale geophysical applications. The principal contribution is a focused treatment of the underlying linear algebraic subproblems, accompanied by a concise and clear introduction to the essential concepts of variational data assimilation and an extensive bibliography.</description>

      <title>GPU-based complete search for nonlinear minimization subject to bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency, the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10 benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU architecture.</description>

      <title>A finite element framework for solving coupled multiphysics problem with moving boundaries in cell biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular morphodynamics requires solving systems of coupled partial differential equations on moving bulk and surface domains, where advection-dominant transport, structure preservation, and severe mesh distortions make robust simulation difficult. We present a holistic finite element framework that jointly addresses these obstacles for biophysical applications by combining model-agnostic structure-preserving postprocessing, ALE-based mesh redistribution strategies driven by surface-tangential velocities, and stabilized discretization for advection-diffusion-reaction problems tailored to evolving domains. The methodology is modular and applies to advection-diffusion-reaction systems, Cahn-Hilliard phase separation, Helfrich-type geometric flows, as well as their staggered and potentially mixed-dimensional couplings. We provide a concise notation for evolving bulk and surface geometries, extend positivity-, bound-, and mass-preserving projections to moving meshes, and develop a two-step redistribution procedure that maintains element quality without remeshing. Convergence studies, manufactured solutions, and biologically motivated test cases -- including tumor-growth surrogates and phase segregation on deformable membranes -- demonstrate accuracy, stability, and versatility across the problem classes considered.</description>

      <title>Study of a TPFA scheme for the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with constraint though numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution provides numerical experiments for a finite volume scheme for an approximation of the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The approximation is done by a Yosida approximation of the subdifferential operator. The problem is set on a polygonal bounded domain in two or three dimensions. The non-linear character of the projection term induces challenges to implement the scheme. To this end, we provide a splitting method for the finite volume scheme. We show that the splitting method is accurate. The computational error estimates induce that the squared $L^2$-error w.r.t. time is of order $1$ as long as the noise term is small enough. For larger noise terms the order of convergence w.r.t. time might become worse.</description>

      <title>A quasi-orthogonal iterative method for eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For large-scale eigenvalue problems requiring many mutually orthogonal eigenvectors, traditional numerical methods suffer substantial computational and communication costs with limited parallel scalability, primarily due to explicit orthogonalization. To address these challenges, we propose a quasi-orthogonal iterative method that dispenses with explicit orthogonalization and orthogonal initial data. It inherently preserves quasi-orthogonality (the iterates asymptotically tend to be orthogonal) and enhances robustness against numerical perturbations. Rigorous analysis confirms its energy-decay property and convergence of energy, gradient, and iterate. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrate key advantages of strong robustness and high-precision numerical orthogonality preservation, and thereby position our iterative method as an efficient, stable alternative for large-scale eigenvalue computations.</description>

      <title>pyCFS-data: Data Processing Framework in Python for openCFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many numerical simulation tools have been developed and are on the market, but there is still a strong need for appropriate tools capable of simulating multi-field problems, especially in aeroacoustics. Therefore, openCFS provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. Since 2000, the software has been developed continuously. The result is openCFS (before 2020, known as CFS++ Coupled Field Simulations written in C++). In this paper, we present pyCFS-data, a data processing framework written in Python to provide a flexible and easy-to-use toolbox to access and manipulate, pre- and postprocess data generated by or for usage with openCFS.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian Computation Using Plug-and-Play Priors for Poisson Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies plug-and-play (PnP) Langevin sampling strategies for Bayesian inference in low-photon Poisson imaging problems, a challenging class of problems with significant applications in astronomy, medicine, and biology. PnP Langevin sampling offers a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. Herein, we leverage and adapt recent developments in this framework to tackle challenging imaging problems involving weakly informative Poisson data. Existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we explore two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is evaluated and contrasted through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The source code accompanying this paper is available at https://github.com/freyyia/pnp-langevin-poisson.</description>

      <title>The factorization of matrices into products of positive definite factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positive-definite matrices materialize as state transition matrices of linear time-invariant gradient flows, and the composition of such materializes as the state transition after successive steps where the driving potential is suitably adjusted. Thus, factoring an arbitrary matrix (with positive determinant) into a product of positive-definite ones provides the needed schedule for a time-varying potential to have a desired effect. The present work provides a detailed analysis of this factorization problem by lifting it into a sequence of Monge-Kantorovich transportation steps on Gaussian distributions and studying the induced holonomy of the optimal transportation problem. From this vantage point we determine the minimal number of positive-definite factors that have a desired effect on the spectrum of the product, e.g., ensure specified eigenvalues or being a rotation matrix. Our approach is computational and allows to identify the needed number of factors as well as trade off their conditioning number with their actual number.</description>

      <title>Improving Matrix Exponential for Generative AI Flows: A Taylor-Based Approach Beyond Paterson--Stockmeyer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Pad\'e approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.</description>
