      <title>Insights of Transitions to Thermoacoustic Instability in Inverse Diffusion Flame using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse diffusion flame (IDF) can experience thermoacoustic instability due to variations in power input or flow conditions. However, the dynamical transitions in IDF that lead to this instability when altering control parameters have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we explore the control parameters through two different approaches and employ multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the transitions observed prior to the onset of thermoacoustic instability in the inverse diffusion flame. Our findings reveal a loss of multifractality near the region associated with thermoacoustic instability, which suggests a more ordered behavior. We determine that the singularity exponent, the width of the multifractal spectrum, and the Hurst exponent are reliable indicators of thermoacoustic instability and serve as effective classifiers of dynamical states in inverse diffusion flames.</description>

      <title>Coupled hydro-aero-turbo dynamics of liquid-tank system for wave energy harvesting: Numerical modellings and scaled prototype tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated numerical model is proposed for the first time to explore the coupled hydro-aero-turbo dynamics of wave-energy-harvesting (WEH) liquid tanks. A scaled prototype of the WEH liquid tank with an impulse air turbine system is made to experimentally validate the numerical model.Multi-layered impulse air turbine systems (MLATS) are creatively introduced into the liquid-tank system. The inherent mechanisms of the coupled hydro-aero-turbo dynamics of the WEH liquid tank with different turbine properties are systematically investigated.Compared with the experimental data, the numerical model can accurately reproduce the rotor speed, liquid motion, and air pressure of the WEH liquid tank. Upon analysing mechanical parameters of the turbine rotor, it is found that the rotor's moment of inertia mainly affects the rotor speed's variation range, while the damping coefficient significantly influences the averaged rotor speed. The optimal power take-off damping for the WEH liquid tank is identified. Considering the efficiency performances of three MLATSs, improving Turbine-L1 to Turbine-L2 or Turbine-L3 can increase the averaged power output by about 25% or 40%, respectively.Increasing the tank breadth can effectively boost the power output in a nonlinear way.Under the considered excitation conditions, if the tank breadth is doubled, the maximum averaged power output can be increased by around four times. Through a series of failure tests, Turbine-L3 shows greater reliability in extreme conditions compared to a conventional single-rotor turbine. Even if the most important rotor of Turbine-L3 fails to work, the maximum loss of the averaged power output is only 44%. The present WEH liquid with Turbine - L3 shows improved efficiency and reliability compared to the conventional liquid-tank system with a single-rotor turbine.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Convolutional Neural Networks for Subgrid-scale Modeling in Large-Eddy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a multiscale convolutional neural network subgrid-scale (MSC-SGS) model for large-eddy simulation (LES). This model incorporates multiscale representations obtained via filtering to capture turbulent vortices interactions and physical processes at different scales. Subsequently, it progressively encodes information from the largest to the smallest scale, thereby mimicking an energy-cascade process. A turbulent channel flow with $\text{Re}_{\tau} = 180$ is adopted as the training and testing dataset, whereas the rate-of-strain tensor is used as the input variable to adhere the rotational invariance. $\textit{A priori}$ test results show that the MSC-SGS model predicts the physical quantities of residual stress, SGS dissipation, backscatter, and SGS transport more accurately than two other convolutional neural network (CNN)-based monoscale and U-Net, while maintaining high temporal correlation. Based on $\textit{a posteriori}$ test, the MSC-SGS model outperforms the two other CNN models and the conventional Smagorinsky model in predicting turbulence statistics while ensuring numerical stability without resorting to ad-hoc treatments such as clipping excessive backscatters. The LES results based on the MSC-SGS model closely align with DNS data in terms of turbulence statistics, energy spectra, and the quantitative reproduction of instantaneous-flow structures. These findings suggest that incorporating multiscale representations effectively advances the development of SGS models for LES.</description>

      <title>Supersonic flow kinetics: Mesoscale structures, thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects and entropy production mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10832v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic flow is a typical nonlinear, nonequilibrium, multiscale, and complex phenomenon. This paper applies discrete Boltzmann method/model (DBM) to simulate and analyze these characteristics. A Burnett-level DBM for supersonic flow is constructed based on the Shakhov-BGK model. Higher-order analytical expressions for thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects are derived, providing a constitutive basis for improving traditional macroscopic hydrodynamics modeling. Criteria for evaluating the validity of DBM are established by comparing numerical and analytical solutions of nonequilibrium measures. The multiscale DBM is used to investigate discrete/nonequilibrium characteristics and entropy production mechanisms in shock regular reflection. The findings include: (a) Compared to NS-level DBM, the Burnett-level DBM offers more accurate representations of viscous stress and heat flux, ensures non-negativity of entropy production in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, and exhibits better numerical stability. (b) Near the interfaces of incident and reflected shock waves, strong nonequilibrium driving forces lead to prominent nonequilibrium effects. By monitoring the timing and location of peak nonequilibrium quantities, the evolution characteristics of incident and reflected shock waves can be accurately and dynamically tracked. (c) In the intermediate state, the bent reflected shock and incident shock interface are wider and exhibit lower nonequilibrium intensities compared to their final state. (d) The Mach number enhances various kinds of nonequilibrium intensities in a power-law manner $D_{mn} \sim \mathtt{Ma}^\alpha $. The power exponent $\alpha$ and kinetic modes of nonequilibrium effects $m$ follows a logarithmic relation $\alpha \sim \ln (m - m_0)$. This research provides new perspectives and kinetic insights into supersonic flow studies.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of the GEKO Turbulence Model for Predicting Flow Separation Over a Smooth Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies Bayesian-optimization-RANS (turbo-RANS) to improve Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models for a converging-diverging channel, a case with adverse pressure gradients and flow separation. Using Bayesian optimization, the Generalized $k$-$\omega$ (GEKO) model was calibrated by tuning $C_\text{SEP}$ and $C_\text{NW}$ with sparse direct numerical simulation (DNS) data at $Re = 12,600$. The calibration followed the Generalized Error Distribution-based Calibration Procedure (GEDCP), optimizing coefficients based on pressure recovery ($C_p$) and skin friction ($C_f$). The optimized model was evaluated beyond training data. Streamwise velocity ($U$) predictions at $Re = 12,600$ were compared to DNS to assess improvements in $C_p$ and $C_f$. To test robustness, comparisons were made against large-eddy simulation (LES) data at $Re = 20,580$ for velocity and skin friction. Results show that optimized GEKO (turbo-RANS) improves wall quantity predictions, particularly reattachment. Improved velocity profiles at both Reynolds numbers suggest Bayesian-optimized coefficients enhance adverse pressure gradient modeling. The model retains accuracy across different $Re$, showing turbo-RANS' potential in turbulence model corrections that generalize across flows. While skin friction predictions showed limited improvement due to constraints of two-equation models, this study highlights the role of machine learning-assisted RANS calibration in improving predictive accuracy for complex flows. The results suggest optimized coefficients from a single dataset can be applied across moderate $Re$ variations, improving turbo-RANS' applicability for turbulence model tuning.</description>

      <title>Discussion on "Resurrecting a Neglected Measurement Technique for Air-Water Flows"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last years, there has been a renewed interest in differentiating various contributions to the air concentration in high Froude-number self-aerated flows, see for example Kramer (2024), comprising entrained and entrapped air. The former is characterized by entrained air packets and bubbles, while entrapped air corresponds to air transported along wave peaks and troughs. Entrapped air was first measured by Killen (1968) using a so-called dipping probe, while a physical interpretation of the dipping probe signals was provided only later by Wilhelms and Gulliver (2005).
  Since then, it has been commonly accepted that two different measurement instruments, for example a dipping probe and a common phase-detection probe, are required to fully quantify entrained and entrapped air. Recently, an article entitled "Resurrecting a Neglected Measurement Technique for Air-Water Flows" was published by Wilhelms and Gulliver (2024), who re-iterated the importance of applying these concepts for cavitation prevention and air-water gas transfer, as well as the need for two separate measurement instruments. The authors are congratulated for their seminal works on entrained and entrapped air (Wilhelms and Gulliver 2005; Wilhelms and Gulliver 2024), and it is stipulated that these concepts have been overlooked in the last two decades.
  In this discussion, a simple discrimination technique for phase-detection probe signals is proposed, which allows to differentiate entrained and entrapped air from existing datasets, recorded with a state-of-the-art dual-tip phase-detection probe. It is believed that this novel signal processing method will make Killen's (1968) dipping probe redundant, and that it will be useful for the validation of non-intrusive measurements of entrapped air, as well as for the development of physics-based models for air-water mass transfer in self-aerated flows.</description>

      <title>Wake transition and aerodynamics of a dragonfly-inspired airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and the stability of the incompressible flow past a corrugated dragonfly-inspired airfoil in the two-dimensional (2D) $\alpha-Re$ parameter space, where $\alpha$ is the angle of attack and $Re$ is the Reynolds number. The angle of attack is varied between $-5^\circ \le \alpha \le 10^\circ$, and $Re$ (based on the free-stream velocity and the airfoil chord) is increased up to $Re=6000$. The study relies on linear stability analyses and three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear direct numerical simulations. For all $\alpha$ the primary instability consists of a Hopf bifurcation towards a periodic regime. The linear stability analysis reveals that two distinct modes drive the flow bifurcation for positive and negative $\alpha$, being characterised by a different frequency and a distinct triggering mechanism. The critical $Re$ decreases as $|\alpha|$ increases, and scales as a power law for large positive/negative $\alpha$. At intermediate $Re$, different limit cycles arise depending on $\alpha$, each one characterised by a distinctive vortex interaction, leading thus to secondary instabilities of different nature. For intermediate positive/negative $\alpha$ vortices are shed from both the top/bottom leading- and trailing-edge shear layers, and the two phenomena are frequency locked. By means of Floquet stability analysis, we show that the secondary instability consists of a 2D subharmonic bifurcation for large negative $\alpha$, of a 2D Neimark--Sacker bifurcation for small negative $\alpha$, of a 3D pitchfork bifurcation for small positive $\alpha$, and of a 3D subharmonic bifurcation for large positive $\alpha$. The aerodynamic performance of the dragonfly-inspired airfoil is discussed in relation to the different flow regimes emerging in the $\alpha-Re$ space of parameters.</description>

      <title>A Kernel Ridge Regression Combining Nonlinear ROMs for Accurate Flow Field Reconstruction with Discontinuities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs), represented by manifold learning (ML), can effectively improve the modeling accuracy of nonlinear flow fields with discontinuities. However, the inverse mapping from low-dimensional manifold coordinates to high-dimensional flow fields often introduces considerable reconstruction errors, leading to inaccuracy in the locations of discontinuities. To address this challenge, a novel reconstruction method is proposed to enhance the accuracy of reconstructing flow fields with discontinuities. The method employs kernel ridge regression (KRR) to construct a set of nonlinear modes rich in discontinuity information, sequentially these modes are nonlinearly combined with manifold coordinates to achieve accurate flow field reconstruction. The proposed reconstruction method is validated to reconstruct the transonic flow fields over RAE2822 airfoil. Comparison results demonstrate that the method achieves superior reconstruction accuracy compared to existing approaches, especially in reconstructing flow fields' discontinuous regions and precisely capturing discontinuities. This work provides an effective and highly interpretable solution for improving the accuracy of nonlinear ROMs in discontinuous flow fields modeling.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation theorems for multi-phase flow with memory in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have reported on the collective behavior of multiphase systems under fractional flow. Such behavior has been linked to pressure and/or flux fluctuations under stationary flow conditions that occur over a broad range of resonance frequencies and associated relaxation times. However, there currently exists no theoretical development to deal with such phenomena. The aim of this paper is to develop a fundamental theory that can describe such behavior. Fluctuation-dissipation theorems for the case with memory are formulated, providing a new route to obtain frequency-dependent porous media permeability.
  We propose that multiphase flow systems can be explained by a multipeak Lorentzian memory function and provide supporting experimental data from the flow of decane and water in a porous medium made of glass beads. Our fluctuation dissipation theorems provide information on different types of relaxation phenomena and resonance frequencies that occur during fractional flow. We show, using experimental data, that Green-Kubo-like expressions can be formulated for two-phase fluid flow driven by a constant pressure drop. The resulting autocorrelation functions, or rather their Fourier transforms, exhibit multiple Lorentzian peak shapes. Resonances are similar to those of electric conductance. The analysis offers a new route to steady-state relative permeability measurements, including information on the relaxation times and resonance regimes that exist during fractional flow. Overall, the theory presented and supported by fractional flow experiments provides a rich set of possible directions for future developments that could fundamentally change the way multiphase flow systems are understood and studied.</description>

      <title>Minimum-dissipation model and symmetry-preserving discretization for scalar transport in a turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the minimum-dissipation model of large-eddy simulation and symmetry-preserving discretization to account for active or passive scalar transport and complex physical mechanisms.This novel scalar-minimum-dissipation model exhibits several desirable properties. It includes the effect of scalar transport, in addition to shear, on the suppression and production of turbulence. It switches off at no-slip walls, ensuring accurate capture of near-wall flow behavior without needing a wall model. It also switches off in laminar and transitional flows so that it is capable of predicting laminar-turbulent transition. The new scalar-minimum-dissipation model combined with the symmetry-preserving discretization is successfully tested in a differentially heated cavity in OpenFOAM. The results show that the symmetry-preserving discretization significantly improves predictions of flow quantity and heat transfer on highly stretched meshes.</description>

      <title>Regimes of spray formation in gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spray formation in ambient atmosphere from gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizers is described by carrying out experiments in a spray test facility. The atomizer discharges a circular air jet and an axisymmetric swirling water sheet from its coaxially arranged inner and outer orifices. A high-speed digital imaging system along with a backlight illumination arrangement is employed to record the details of liquid sheet breakup and spray development. Spray regimes exhibiting different sheet breakup mechanisms are identified and their characteristic features presented. The identified spray regimes are wave-assisted sheet breakup, perforated sheet breakup, segmented sheet breakup, and pulsation spray regime. In the regime of wave-assisted sheet breakup, the sheet breakup shows features similar to the breakup of two-dimensional planar air-blasted liquid sheets. At high air-to-liquid momentum ratios, the interaction process between the axisymmetric swirling liquid sheet and the circular air jet develops spray processes which are more specific to the atomizer studied here. The spray exhibits a periodic ejection of liquid masses whose features are dominantly controlled by the central air jet.</description>

      <title>Moist Vortex Dynamics of Axisymmetric Tropical Cyclones Before Reaching Symmetric Neutrality - Part I: A Generalized Tangential Wind Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential intensity (PI) theory of tropical cyclones (TCs) provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum intensity of a steady-state TC in a quiescent environment. The traditional PI theory relies on the symmetric neutrality (SN) assumption, where the isolines of absolute angular momentum (M) are parallel to the saturation entropy (s*) surfaces within the eyewall updraft. When the SN is not valid, there is currently no quantitative theory that explicitly describes how these surfaces directly relate to the maximum tangential wind (vmax) near the surface. In this study, the PI theory is revisited without making the SN assumption. Under non-SN conditions, it is found that the balance between the centrifugal torque and baroclinic torque provides a strong constraint on the vortex structure and balanced intensity. Specifically, it is shown that the gradient between s* and M along constant temperature (T) throughout the saturated eyewall determines the structure of the M surface and the balanced intensity at the low level. The same technique can be applied to obtain the generalized terms that correspond to the unbalanced component. It is shown that this generalized vmax equation is the natural extension of the traditional PI formula into the non-symmetric neutrality regime. Verifying against axisymmetric simulations, it is shown that the generalized vmax equation can accurately quantify the various contributions to vmax during the rapid intensification process. The implications of these findings on the TC rapid intensification, such as the TC inner-core structure and the upper-tropospheric mixing process, are examined.</description>

      <title>Analytical methods for cytoplasmic streaming in elongated cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the coherent flow of cytoplasm, plays a critical role in transport and mixing over large scales in eukaryotic cells. In many large cells, this process is driven by active forces at the cell boundary, such as cortical cytoskeletal contractions in Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, or intracellular cargo transport in plant cells. These cytoplasmic flows are approximately Newtonian and governed by the Stokes equations. In this paper, we use lubrication theory - a powerful technique for simplifying the fluid mechanics equations in elongated geometries - to derive a general solution for boundary-driven cytoplasmic flows. We apply this framework to predict cytoplasmic fluid dynamics and cortical stresses in four systems of biological significance: the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos (including pseudocleavage furrow formation), the pollen tube of seed plants, and plant root hair cells. Our results showcase the elegance and accuracy of asymptotic solutions in capturing the complex flows and stress patterns in diverse biological contexts, reinforcing its utility as a robust tool for cellular biophysics.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification for bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates model reduction techniques for nonlinear parameterized and time-dependent PDEs, specifically focusing on bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We develop interpretable and non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) capable of capturing dynamics associated with bifurcations by identifying a minimal set of coordinates. Our methodology combines the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method with a deep learning framework based on Autoencoder (AE) architectures. To enhance dimensionality reduction, we integrate a nested Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with the SINDy-AE architecture. This novel combination enables a sparse discovery of system dynamics while maintaining efficiency of the reduced model. We demonstrate our approach via two challenging test cases defined on sudden-expansion channel geometries: a symmetry-breaking bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. Starting from a comprehensive analysis of their high-fidelity behavior, i.e. symmetry-breaking phenomena and the rise of unsteady periodic solutions, we validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our ROMs. The results show successful reconstruction of the bifurcations, accurate prediction of system evolution for unseen parameter values, and significant speed-up compared to full-order methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Generalization capabilities and robustness of hybrid models grounded in physics compared to purely deep learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the generalization capabilities and robustness of purely deep learning (DL) models and hybrid models based on physical principles in fluid dynamics applications, specifically focusing on iteratively forecasting the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. Three autoregressive models were compared: a hybrid model (POD-DL) that combines proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with a long-short term memory (LSTM) layer, a convolutional autoencoder combined with a convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) layer and a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with a ConvLSTM layer. These models were tested on two high-dimensional, nonlinear datasets representing the velocity field of flow past a circular cylinder in both laminar and turbulent regimes. The study used latent dimension methods, enabling a bijective reduction of high-dimensional dynamics into a lower-order space to facilitate future predictions. While the VAE and ConvLSTM models accurately predicted laminar flow, the hybrid POD-DL model outperformed the others across both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. This success is attributed to the model's ability to incorporate modal decomposition, reducing the dimensionality of the data, by a non-parametric method, and simplifying the forecasting component. By leveraging POD, the model not only gained insight into the underlying physics, improving prediction accuracy with less training data, but also reduce the number of trainable parameters as POD is non-parametric. The findings emphasize the potential of hybrid models, particularly those integrating modal decomposition and deep learning, in predicting complex flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Traveling spatially localized convective structures in an inclined porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple stationary, localized structures were recently found for inclined porous medium convection with constant-temperature boundaries. We analyze traveling asymmetric, localized convective structures, consisting of 1 to 5 pulses, in a 2D inclined porous layer with fixed temperature at the bottom and an imperfectly conducting boundary at the top, such that midplane reflection symmetry is broken. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed with different Biot numbers at the top boundary. The drift velocity $c$ of pulses is measured for different values of the symmetry parameter $\kappa\geq0$ based on the Biot number, with perfect midplane reflection symmetry and $c=0$ at $\kappa=0$. In small domains, the drift velocity $c&gt;0$ (upslope), increases monotonically with $\kappa$, while in large domains $c$ changes sign depending on parameters. We show that pulse tails, controlling interactions, depend on the dominant spatial eigenvalues, whose real part is closest to zero, with a transition at $\kappa_c&gt;0$: below $\kappa_c$, both dominant eigenvalues are complex, and the tails are oscillatory. Above $\kappa_c$, the dominant spatial eigenvalue with a positive real part becomes real, and the downslope tail transitions from oscillatory to monotonic. Below $\kappa_c$, bound states with different numbers of pulses exist whose collisions are studied. Well above $\kappa_c$, adjacent pulses repel each other, spreading out and becoming equispaced in the domain. A reduced model is proposed based on the interaction via tails of adjacent pulses, reproducing the repulsion and collisions from DNS. The model shows that the transition from bound states to equidistant spreading occurs when the monotonic/oscillatory tails have the same slope. This study elucidates the motion of localized patterns in moderate-Rayleigh number convection in an inclined porous layer with an imperfectly conducting boundary.</description>

      <title>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors.</description>

      <title>Viscoplasticity can stabilise liquid collar motion on vertical cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid films coating vertical cylinders can form annular liquid collars which translate downwards under gravity. We investigate the dynamics of a thin viscoplastic liquid film coating the interior or exterior of a vertical cylindrical tube, quantifying how the yield stress modifies both the Rayleigh-Plateau instability leading to collar formation and the translation of collars down the tube. We use thin-film theory to derive an evolution equation for the layer thickness, which we solve numerically to determine the nonlinear dynamics of an initially flat layer. A flat layer is unstable to small disturbances in the free-surface height when gravity is sufficiently strong to make the fluid yield. We use matched asymptotics to derive a model describing the quasi-steady translation of a slender liquid collar when the Bond number is small. The structure of the asymptotic solution for a viscoplastic collar shares some features with the Newtonian version, but there are several novel asymptotic regions that emerge at the two ends of the collar. The global force balance, which determines the collar's speed, is modified by a leading-order contribution from viscous drag in the collar when the liquid is viscoplastic. We use the asymptotic model to describe slow changes in collar volume when the film thicknesses ahead of, and behind, the collar are unequal. When the film thickness ahead of the collar is less than a critical value that we determine, viscoplastic collars adjust their volume and reach a steadily-translating state. This contrasts with the Newtonian problem, where the only state in which steady translation occurs is unstable to small changes in the film thickness.</description>

      <title>Abyssal Slope Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic computational simulations in different oceanic basins reveal prevalent prograde mean flows (i.e. in the direction of topographic Rossby wave propagation along isobaths; a.k.a. topostrophy) on topographic slopes in the deep ocean, consistent with the barotropic theory of eddy-driven mean flows. Attention is focused on the Western Mediterranean Sea with strong currents and steep topography. These prograde mean currents induce an opposing bottom drag stress and thus a turbulent boundary-layer mean flow in the downhill direction, evidenced by a near-bottom negative mean vertical velocity. The slope-normal profile of diapycnal buoyancy mixing results in down-slope mean advection near the bottom (a tendency to locally increase the mean buoyancy) and up-slope buoyancy mixing (a tendency to decrease buoyancy) with associated buoyancy fluxes across the mean isopycnal surfaces (diapycnal downwelling). In the upper part of the boundary layer and nearby interior, the diapycnal turbulent buoyancy flux divergence reverses sign (diapycnal upwelling), with upward Eulerian mean buoyancy advection across isopycnal surfaces. These near-slope tendencies abate with further distance from the boundary. An along-isobath mean momentum balance shows an advective acceleration and a bottom-drag retardation of the prograde flow. The eddy buoyancy advection is significant near the slope, and the associated eddy potential energy conversion is negative, consistent with mean vertical shear flow generation for the eddies. This cross-isobath flow structure differs from previous proposals, and a new one-dimensional model is constructed for a topostrophic, stratified, slope bottom boundary layer. The broader issue of the return pathways of the global thermohaline circulation remains open, but the abyssal slope region is likely to play a dominant role.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of an attention-based neural network architecture known as the Senseiver to perform sparse sensing tasks in the context of tsunami forecasting. In particular, we focus on the Tsunami Data Assimilation Method, where forecasts are derived from tsunameter networks. We used our model to generate high-resolution tsunami waves from incredibly sparse observations, whose epicenters are not included in the training set. We also show significantly improved accuracy in the generation of dense observation networks by comparison to the Linear Interpolation with Huygens-Fresnel Principle.</description>
