      <title>The integro-differential closure of a commutative differential ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integro-differential ring is a differential ring that is closed under an integration operation satisfying the fundamental theorem of calculus. Via the Newton--Leibniz formula, a generalized evaluation is defined in terms of integration and differentiation. The induced evaluation is not necessarily multiplicative, which allows to model functions with singularities and leads to generalized shuffle relations. In general, not every element of a differential ring has an antiderivative in the same ring. Starting from a commutative differential ring and a direct decomposition into integrable and non-integrable elements, we construct the free integro-differential ring. This integro-differential closure contains all nested integrals over elements of the original differential ring. We exhibit the relations satisfied by generalized evaluations of products of nested integrals. Investigating these relations of constants, we characterize in terms of Lyndon words certain evaluations of products that determine all others. We also analyze the relation of the free integro-differential ring with the shuffle algebra. To preserve integrals in the original differential ring for computations in its integro-differential closure, we introduce the notion of quasi-integro-differential rings and give an adapted construction of the free integro-differential ring. Finally, in a given integro-differential ring, we consider the internal integro-differential closure of a differential subring and identify it as quotient of the free integro-differential ring by certain constants.</description>

      <title>Computing change of level and isogenies between abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $m,n,d &gt; 1$ be integers such that $n=md$. In this paper, we present an efficient change of level algorithm that takes as input $(B, \mathscr{M}, \Theta_\mathscr{M})$ a marked abelian variety of level $m$ over the base field $k$ of odd characteristic and returns $(B, \mathscr{M}^d, \Theta_{\mathscr{M}^d})$ a marked abelian variety of level $n$ at the expense of $O(m^g d^{2g})$ operations in $k$. A similar algorithm allows to compute $d$-isogenies: from $(B, \mathscr{M}, \Theta_\mathscr{M})$ a marked abelian variety of level $m$, $K\subset B[d]$ isotropic for the Weil pairing isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z})^g$ defined over $k$, the isogeny algorithm returns $(A, \mathscr{L}, \Theta_\mathscr{L})$ of level $m$ such that $A=B/K$ with $O(m^g d^g)$ operations in $k$. Our algorithms extend previous known results in the case that $d \wedge m=1$ and $d$ odd. In this paper, we lift theses restrictions. We use the same general approach as in the literature in conjunction with the notion of symmetric compatible that we introduce, study and link to previous results of Mumford. For practical computation, most of the time $m$ is $2$ or $4$ so that our algorithms allows in particular to compute $2^e$-isogenies which are important for the theory of theta functions but also for computational applications such as isogeny based cryptography.</description>
