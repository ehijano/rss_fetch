      <title>My part is bigger than yours -- assessment within a group of peers using the pairwise comparisons method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A project (e.g. writing a collaborative research paper) is often a group effort. At the end, each contributor identifies his or her contribution, often verbally. The reward, however, is quite often financial in nature. This leads to the question of what (percentage) share in the creation of the paper is due to individual authors. Different authors may have various opinions on the matter, and, even worse, their opinions may have different relevance. In this paper, we present a simple models that allows aggregation of experts' opinions linking the priority of his preference directly to the assessment made by other experts. In this approach, the greater the contribution of a given expert, the greater the importance of his opinion. The presented method can be considered as an attempt to find consensus among a group of peers involved in the same project. Hence, its applications may go beyond the proposed study example of writing a scientific paper.</description>

      <title>Dual Bounded Generation: Polynomial, Second-order Cone and Positive Semidefinite Matrix Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the monotone integer dualization problem, we are given two sets of vectors in an integer box such that no vector in the first set is dominated by a vector in the second. The question is to check if the two sets of vectors cover the entire integer box by upward and downward domination, respectively. It is known that the problem is (quasi-)polynomially equivalent to that of enumerating all maximal feasible solutions of a given monotone system of linear/separable/supermodular inequalities over integer vectors. The equivalence is established via showing that the dual family of minimal infeasible vectors has size bounded by a (quasi-)polynomial in the sizes of the family to be generated and the input description. Continuing in this line of work, in this paper, we consider systems of polynomial, second-order cone, and semidefinite inequalities. We give sufficient conditions under which such bounds can be established and highlight some applications.</description>

      <title>H-Clique-Width and a Hereditary Analogue of Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generalization of the notion of clique-width which aims to bridge the gap between classical hereditary width measures and the recently introduced graph product structure theory. Bounding the new H-clique-width, in the special case of H being the class of paths, is equivalent to admitting a hereditary (i.e., induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded clique-width. Furthermore, every graph admitting the usual (non-induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded tree-width, has bounded H-clique-width and, as a consequence, it admits the usual product structure in an induced way. We prove further basic properties of H-clique-width in general.</description>

      <title>Separating the edges of a graph by cycles and by subdivisions of $K_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A separating system of a graph $G$ is a family $\mathcal{S}$ of subgraphs of $G$ for which the following holds: for all distinct edges $e$ and $f$ of $G$, there exists an element in $\mathcal{S}$ that contains $e$ but not $f$. Recently, it has been shown that every graph of order $n$ admits a separating system consisting of $19n$ paths [Bonamy, Botler, Dross, Naia, Skokan, Separating the Edges of a Graph by a Linear Number of Paths, Adv. Comb., October 2023], improving the previous almost linear bound of $\mathrm{O}(n\log^\star n)$ [S. Letzter, Separating paths systems of almost linear size, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., to appear], and settling conjectures posed by Balogh, Csaba, Martin, and Pluh\'ar and by Falgas-Ravry, Kittipassorn, Kor\'andi, Letzter, and Narayanan.
  We investigate a natural generalization of these results to subdivisions of cliques, showing that every graph admits both a separating system consisting of $41n$ edges and cycles, and a separating system consisting of $82 n$ edges and subdivisions of $K_4$.</description>

      <title>Minsum Problem for Discrete and Weighted Set Flow on Dynamic Path Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we examine the minsum flow problem in dynamic path networks where flows are represented as discrete and weighted sets. The minsum flow problem has been widely studied for its relevance in finding evacuation routes during emergencies such as earthquakes. However, previous approaches often assume that individuals are separable and identical, which does not adequately account for the fact that some groups of people, such as families, need to move together and that some groups may be more important than others. To address these limitations, we modify the minsum flow problem to support flows represented as discrete and weighted sets. We also propose a 2-approximation pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to solve this modified problem for path networks with uniform capacity.</description>

      <title>Graceful coloring is computationally hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a (proper) vertex coloring $f$ of a graph $G$, say $f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{N}$, the difference edge labelling induced by $f$ is a function $h\colon E(G)\to \mathbb{N}$ defined as $h(uv)=|f(u)-f(v)|$ for every edge $uv$ of $G$. A graceful coloring of $G$ is a vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ such that the difference edge labelling $h$ induced by $f$ is a (proper) edge coloring of $G$. A graceful coloring with range $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ is called a graceful $k$-coloring. The least integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a graceful $k$-coloring is called the graceful chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_g(G)$.
  We prove that $\chi(G^2)\leq \chi_g(G)\leq a(\chi(G^2))$ for every graph $G$, where $a(n)$ denotes the $n$th term of the integer sequence A065825 in OEIS. We also prove that graceful coloring problem is NP-hard for planar bipartite graphs, regular graphs and 2-degenerate graphs. In particular, we show that for each $k\geq 5$, it is NP-complete to check whether a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $k-2$ is graceful $k$-colorable. The complexity of checking whether a planar graph is graceful 4-colorable remains open.</description>

      <title>$k$-Leaf Powers Cannot be Characterized by a Finite Set of Forbidden Induced Subgraphs for $k \geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a $k$-leaf power if there is a tree $T$ whose leaves are the vertices of $G$ with the property that a pair of leaves $u$ and $v$ induce an edge in $G$ if and only if they are distance at most $k$ apart in $T$. For $k\le 4$, it is known that there exists a finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that the class $L(k)$ of $k$-leaf power graphs is characterized as the set of strongly chordal graphs that do not contain any graph in $F_k$ as an induced subgraph. We prove no such characterization holds for $k\ge 5$. That is, for any $k\ge 5$, there is no finite set $F_k$ of graphs such that $L(k)$ is equivalent to the set of strongly chordal graphs that do not contain as an induced subgraph any graph in $F_k$.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>$\epsilon$-Uniform Mixing in Discrete Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study whether the probability distribution of a discrete quantum walk can get arbitrarily close to uniform, given that the walk starts with a uniform superposition of the outgoing arcs of some vertex. We establish a characterization of this phenomenon on regular non-bipartite graphs in terms of their adjacency eigenvalues and eigenprojections. Using theory from association schemes, we show this phenomenon happens on a strongly regular graph $X$ if and only if $X$ or $\overline{X}$ has parameters $(4m^2, 2m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m, m^2\pm m)$ where $m\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Minimum Steiner Cut in Maximum Flow Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise a deterministic algorithm for minimum Steiner cut, which uses $(\log n)^{O(1)}$ maximum flow calls and additional near-linear time. This algorithm improves on Li and Panigrahi's (FOCS 2020) algorithm, which uses $(\log n)^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}$ maximum flow calls and additional $O(m^{1+\epsilon})$ time, for $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Our algorithm thus shows that deterministic minimum Steiner cut can be solved in maximum flow time up to polylogarithmic factors, given any black-box deterministic maximum flow algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a novel deterministic graph decomposition method for terminal vertices that generalizes all existing $s$-strong partitioning methods, which we believe may have future applications.</description>

      <title>A Nearly Optimal Deterministic Algorithm for Online Transportation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the online transportation problem with $m$ server sites, it has long been known that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at least $2m-1$. Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs conjectured in 1998 that a deterministic $(2m-1)$-competitive algorithm exists for this problem, a conjecture that has remained open for over two decades.
  In this paper, we propose a new deterministic algorithm named Subtree-Decomposition for the online transportation problem and show that it achieves a competitive ratio of at most $8m-5$. This is the first $O(m)$-competitive deterministic algorithm, coming close to the lower bound of $2m-1$ within a constant factor.</description>
