      <title>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Eightfold Degenerate Dirac Nodal Line in Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn$_5$Si$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic, magnetic, and spin transport properties of the orthorhombic Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ compound in the $AF2$ phase using symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations. Our ground state energy calculations align with experimental observations, demonstrating that the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, with N\'{e}el vector in the [010] direction, is the most stable magnetic configuration both with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a bulk lattice geometry. We identified an unconventional eight-fold degenerate Dirac nodal line (DNL) close to the Fermi level, characterized by negligible SOC. This DNL is robustly protected by a unique combination of a pure-spin symmetry and a lattice symmetry together with magnetic space group symmetries. Upon introducing SOC, this degeneracy is reduced to two four-fold DNLs, being protected by the combination of time-reversal, partial translation and nonsymmorphic symmetries within the magnetic space group. We predict also a large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) which correlates with the presence of SOC-induced splitting of these eight-fold degenerate DNLs near the Fermi level. These intriguing characteristics position collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ as a compelling candidate for spintronic applications, particularly in the generation and detection of spin currents, while remaining compatible with modern silicon technology.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum dielectric function and excitonic effects from time-dependent density-functional theory with dielectrically screened hybrid functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for calculating the dielectric function of semiconductors and insulators at finite momentum transfer, comparing against the standard Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Specifically, we consider a recently proposed hybrid approach that mixes dielectrically screened exact exchange with a semilocal functional, and we also introduce a new hybrid functional featuring a truncated dielectric screening scheme. The computational effort of these hybrid TDDFT approaches is significantly less than that of the BSE, but they deliver comparable accuracy, as demonstrated for the semiconductors Si and GaN and the wide-band insulator LiF. This opens up possibilities for calculating exciton dispersions and electron energy loss functions efficiently and accurately for a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.</description>

      <title>Twisted oxide membrane interface by local atomic registry design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplay of lattice, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom in complex oxide materials has hosted a plethora of exotic quantum phases and physical properties. Recent advances in synthesis of freestanding complex oxide membranes and twisted heterostructures assembled from membranes provide new opportunities for discovery using moir\'e design with local lattice control. To this end, we designed moir\'e crystals at the coincidence site lattice condition, providing commensurate structure within the moir\'e supercell arising from the multi-atom complex oxide unit cell. We fabricated such twisted bilayers from freestanding SrTiO3 membranes and used depth sectioning-based TEM methods to discover ordered charge states at the moir\'e interface. By selectively imaging SrTiO3 atomic planes at different depths through the bilayer, we clearly resolved the moir\'e periodic structure at the twisted interface and found that it exhibits lattice-dependent charge disproportionation in the local atomic registry within the moir\'e supercell. Our density-functional modelling of the twisted oxide interface predicts that these moir\'e phenomena are accompanied by the emergence of a two-dimensional flat band that can drive new electronic phases. Our work provides a novel guideline for controlling moir\'e periodicity in twisted oxides and opens pathways to exploit the new functionalities via moir\'e lattice-driven charge-orbital correlation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance and Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells with Ag-Cu-Zn Alloy Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the common metal electrode-based perovskite solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of &gt;25%, they also play a crucial role in accelerating the degradation of the cells. In this study, we investigated phase transition engineering in Ag electrodes via Cu and Zn alloying, transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase. These alloyed electrodes are then thermally deposited as back electrodes in perovskite solar cells. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pure Ag and Ag-Cu-Zn alloys deposited atop a hole-transport layer for use in Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based solar cells. Our findings reveal that solar cells developed with pure Ag electrodes demonstrate a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.71%, characterized by a fill factor (FF) of 74.8%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V, and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.17 mA/cm2. Conversely, solar cells fabricated with optimized Ag0.875Cu0.120Zn0.005 electrodes exhibit enhanced performance metrics, with an FF of 72.5%, VOC of 1.12 V, and JSC of 23.39 mA/cm2, culminating in an elevated PCE of 19.02%. Moreover, this electrode demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining operational integrity for 460 hours for the PSCs stored in the N2 glove box, in contrast to the 320 hours for cells with Ag electrodes. The Ag-Cu-Zn alloys exhibited high resistance to corrosion and good adhesion on the hole-transport material layer compared to a layer of Ag. These advancements may lead to the realization of cost-effective, durable, and efficient solar energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</description>

      <title>Theory of Slidetronics in Ferroelectric van der Waals Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertically stacked layers derived from non-ferroelectric monolayers offer a promising route to two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, where polarization switching occurs via interlayer sliding at sub-unit cell scales. Here, we develop a theory of slidetronics based on the notion that sliding-induced switching $P \rightarrow P'$ can also be achieved by applying an appropriate point-group operator $G$ to the entire system, such that $P' = G P$. Interlayer sliding and the transformation induced by the generator $G$ are thus equivalent in describing the relationship between the initial and final layer configurations. From this symmetry principle, we deduce that slidetronics can be classified by generators $G$; the generator $G$ must act as a symmetry operator for the constituent layers, while it is not a symmetry operator for the stacked layers as a whole; for a given 2D material, $G$ determines the interlayer sliding required for polarization switching; and sliding-induced complete polarization inversion is impossible in bilayers but can be realized in multilayers (e.g., PdSe$_2$ trilayers). These findings provide a framework for designing 2D ferroelectrics with targeted polarization-switching properties, as demonstrated through case studies of real materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of substrate temperature on the deposition of Al-doped ZnO thin films using high power impulse magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Al-doped ZnO thin films were deposited using reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering at substrate temperatures between room temperature and 600 $\bullet$ C. Two sample series with different oxygen partial pressures were studied. The films with the lowest resistivity of 3 x 10 -4 $\Omega$cm were deposited at the highest substrate temperature of 600 $\bullet$ C. The improvement of the electrical properties could be related to an improvement of the mobility due to the improved crystallinity. This improved crystallinity also increased the stability of the films towards ambient moisture. On the other hand, the detrimental influence of negative oxygen bombardment could be avoided, as the HiPIMS process can take place in the metal or transition mode even at relatively high oxygen partial pressures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanothiazoles, small and quite overlooked molecules, possess remarkable optical properties that can be fine-tuned through coordination with transition metals. In this study, we investigate a promising application of cyanothiazoles, where their combination with copper(I) iodide forms a new class of complexes exhibiting outstanding optical properties. X-ray crystallography of copper(I) iodide complexes with isomeric cyanothiazoles revealed key structural features, such as {\pi}-{\pi} stacking, hydrogen bonding, and rare halogen-chalcogen I-S interactions, enhancing stability and reactivity. Advanced spectroscopy and computational modeling allowed precise identification of spectral signatures in FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra. Fluorescence studies, along with XANES synchrotron analyses, highlighted their unique thermal and electronic properties, providing a solid foundation for further research in the field.</description>

      <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thiazolothiazoles (TzTz) represent a class of compounds with distinctive structural motifs and exceptional optical properties, positioning them as promising candidates for breakthroughs in optoelectronic and sensing technologies. X-ray crystallographic analyses of TzTz units symmetrically substituted with functional groups such as imidazole, o-vanillin, p-vanillin, phenyl, thiazole, cinnamate, and bistrifluoromethylphenyl have revealed complex structural features, including {\pi}-{\pi} stacking interactions, hydrogen-bond networks, and specific chalcogen and halogen interactions. These interactions collectively enhance the stability and define the unique spectroscopic profiles of these compounds. Beyond classical spectral fingerprints (FTIR, NMR, and UV-Vis spectra), fluorescence studies at various temperatures, complemented by XANES synchrotron analyses, have underscored their remarkable thermal and electronic properties. The findings presented here offer a comprehensive framework for the characterization and analysis of TzTz compounds, emphasizing their potential as components in smart electronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalyst discovery through text mining and multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and optimization of high-performance materials is the basis for advancing energy conversion technologies. To understand composition-property relationships, all available data sources should be leveraged: experimental results, predictions from simulations, and latent knowledge from scientific texts. Among these three, text-based data sources are still not used to their full potential. We present an approach combining text mining, Word2Vec representations of materials and properties, and Pareto front analysis for the prediction of high-performance candidate materials for electrocatalysis in regions where other data sources are scarce or non-existent. Candidate compositions are evaluated on the basis of their similarity to the terms `conductivity' and `dielectric', which enables reaction-specific candidate composition predictions for oxygen reduction (ORR), hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. This, combined with Pareto optimization, allows us to significantly reduce the pool of candidate compositions to high-performing compositions. Our predictions, which are purely based on text data, match the measured electrochemical activity very well.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of interfaces for double-cation halide perovskites with AVA2FAPb2I7 additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of mixed cation absorber composition was considered as an efficient strategy to mitigate the degradation effects in halide perovskite solar cells. Despite the reports about partial stabilization at elevated temperatures, unfavorable phase transition after thermocycling and electric field-driven corrosion remains critical bottlenecks of perovskite thin-films semiconductors. In this work, we developed stabilized heterostructures based on CsFAPbI3, modified with mechanically synthesized quasi-2D perovskite incorporating the 5-ammonium valeric acid cation (AVA2FAPb2I7). We found that integration of AVA2FAPb2I7 into grain boundaries boosts phase resilience under harsh thermocycling from -10 up to 100 C and suppresses transitions, as well as decomposition to PbI2. The rapid oxidation of metal contacts in the multi-layer stacks with non-passivated CsFAPbI3 was effectively suppressed in the fabricated heterostructure. A comprehensive interface study of the copper electrode contact revealed that the incorporation of AVA2FAPb2I7 stabilized the lead and iodine states and suppressed contamination of FA cation in ambient conditions. Meanwhile, the metal-perovskite interface remained predominantly in the Cu(0)-Cu(I) state. The observed stabilization in perovskite heterostructure was attributed to an increased activation energy for delta-phase accumulation at the grain boundaries combined with reduced ionic diffusion. The obtained results opened important highlights for the mechanisms of the improved phase stability after thermal cycling and mitigation of the interface corrosion and under an applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Innate Crystal Structure Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials discovery, enabling the prediction of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate stable crystal structures without additional training. Our novel framework MatLLMSearch integrates pre-trained LLMs with evolutionary search algorithms, achieving a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability via quantum mechanical calculations, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework can be readily adapted to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish pre-trained LLMs as versatile and effective tools for materials discovery, opening up new venues for crystal structure generation with reduced computational overhead and broader accessibility.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electromechanical Properties of Solution-Processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ is among the most promising lead-free piezoelectrics. While its sputtered films match the performance of the champion piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$, processing of high-quality, reproducible, and time-stable solution-processed K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films remains challenging. Here, we report 1 $\mu$m-thick Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films prepared through a chemical solution deposition process, which have perfectly dense microstructure and uniform composition across their thickness. The films exhibit a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient (e$_{31,f}$ = -14.8 C/m$^{2}$), high dielectric permittivity (${\epsilon}_{r}$ = 920), low dielectric losses (tan${\delta}$ = 0.05) and can withstand electric fields up to at least 1 MV/cm. The functional properties show excellent stability over time, and the synthesis process is reproducible. The results demonstrate the high potential of Mn-doped K$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$NbO$_{3}$ films to become a replacement for lead-based Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$ films in piezoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Anomalous Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is an efficient tool for detecting the N\'eel vector in collinear compensated magnets with spin-split bands, known as altermagnets (AMs). Here, we establish design principles for obtaining non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity in the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) AMs using spin and magnetic group symmetry analysis. We show that only two of the seven nontrivial spin layer groups exhibit an unconventional in-plane AHE in which the N\'eel vector lies within the plane of the Hall current. Through first-principles simulations on bilayers of MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe, we demonstrate the validity of our group theoretic framework for obtaining AHE with $d$ and $i$-wave altermagnetic orders, depending on the stacking of the bilayers. We find that the spin group symmetry is successful in determining the linear and cubic dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in N\'eel vector space, although AHE is a relativistic effect. This work shows that the AHE in 2D AMs can probe the altermagnetic order and N\'eel vector reversal, thereby facilitating the miniaturization of altermagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Single-crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films grown by dc magnetron co-sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnetism has sparked renewed interest in the growth of epitaxial films of the NiAs-phase polymorph of CrSb. This paper describes the magnetron sputtering-based fabrication and characterization of high-quality single crystalline CrSb(0001) thin films supported by an isostructural non-magnetic PtSb buffer. X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the films are phase-pure and possess a very high crystalline quality (mosaicity ~0.05 deg), while also being free of extended crystallographic defects. Both scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirm their smooth and homogeneous topography. Additionally, the elemental composition of our films was found to be close to stoichiometric via electron probe microanalysis and X-ray fluorescence. Thus, the developed samples represent an ideal platform for further investigation of the material properties of CrSb.</description>

      <title>Extremely large magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly in the nodal-line semimetal ZrAs2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the detailed magnetotransport measurements and first principle calculations to study the electronic properties of the transition metal dipnictides ZrAs2, which is a topological nodal-line semimetal. Extremely large unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) which is up to 1.9 * 10^4 % at 2 K and 14 T was observed with magnetic field along the c-axis. The nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity indicates the multi-band features, and the electron and hole are nearly compensated according to the analysis of the two-band model, which may account for the extremely large unsaturated MR at low temperatures. The evident Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at low temperatures are observed and four distinct oscillation frequencies are extracted. The first principle calculations and angle-dependent SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. The observed twofold symmetry MR with electric field along the b-axis direction is consistent with our calculated Fermi surface structures. Furthermore, the negative magnetoresistance (NMR) with magnetic field in parallel with electric field is observed, which is an evident feature of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Raman Signatures of Single Point Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we systematically characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape, enabling the narrowing of potential defect candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations, implying the versatility of this approach. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experiment framework for using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Multiple magnetic states, valley electronics, and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te): From monolayers to bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the coupling between layer, magnetism, valley, and topology in two-dimensional (2D) materials is an important approach to deepen our understanding of materials properties. We propose 27 stable ferromagnetic semiconductor monolayers of Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z = S, Se, Te). All these monolayers exhibit spontaneous valley polarization, forming ferrovalley (FV) monolayers, showing anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect. By applying external strain, the topological phase transitions including quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be introduced. In the ScBrSH bilayer system, AA and AB stacking configurations were constructed through interlayer sliding and rotational operation. The bilayer system exhibits interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with spontaneous valley polarization differing from the FV observed in monolayers. The sliding ferroelectricity observed in the AA stacking indicates that the system exhibits significant multiferroic characteristics. Further analysis shows that interlayer sliding can introduce a layer polarization anomalous valley Hall (LPAVH) effect, which can be precisely controlled by tuning the direction of the ferroelectric polarization. Upon applying external strain, the quantum layer spin Hall (QLSH) effect observed during the topological phase transition in the bilayer can be regarded as the superposition of two QAH monolayers. Furthermore, applying a twisting operation to the bilayer induces unexpected altermagnetism. Our study systematically reveals the rich physical properties of 2D XYZH materials, providing important theoretical foundations and guidance for the design and development of next-generation quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Selection for Efficient MLIP Dataset Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of constructing a dataset for MLIP development which gives the maximum quality in the minimum amount of compute time is complex, and can be approached in a number of ways. We introduce a ``Bayesian selection" approach for selecting from a candidate set of structures, and compare the effectiveness of this method against other common approaches in the task of constructing ideal datasets targeting Silicon surface energies. We show that the Bayesian selection method performs much better than Simple Random Sampling at this task (for example, the error on the (100) surface energy is 4.3x lower in the low data regime), and is competitive with a variety of existing selection methods, using ACE and MACE features.</description>

      <title>Atomically Modulating Competing Exchange Interactions in Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Hosts GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin states enabling high-density, low-power spin electronics. Despite growing efforts to find new skyrmion host systems, the microscopic mechanisms leading to skyrmion phase transitions at specific temperatures and magnetic fields remain elusive. Here, we systematically study the isostructural centrosymmetric magnets- GdRu2X2 (X = Si and Ge), and the role of X-p orbitals in modifying magnetic exchange interactions. GdRu2Ge2 single crystals, synthesized by arc melting, exhibit two high-entropy pockets associated with skyrmion phases at 0.9 T &lt; H &lt; 1.2 T and 1.3 T &lt; H &lt; 1.7 T, 2 K &lt; T &lt; 30 K-more accessible condition at lower fields and higher temperatures than that in the Si counterpart. Entropy estimations from heat capacity measurements align with magnetization data, and transport studies confirm a topological Hall effect, highlighting the system's nontrivial spin textures and Berry curvature. Compared to GdRu2Si2, electronic structure and exchange interaction evaluations reveal the more extended Ge-4p orbitals enhance competing exchange interactions in GdRu2Ge2, thereby manifesting the rich skyrmion behavior. This work demonstrates how modifying exchange interactions at the atomic level enables the tunability of topologically nontrivial electronic states while advancing our understanding of skyrmion formation mechanisms for future spintronics.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-model correction of Foundation Model based on the models own understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models of interatomic potentials, so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such augmentation can be accomplished via $\Delta$-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\Delta$-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the "8" Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in recent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based $\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.</description>

      <title>Flexible Tuning of Asymmetric Near-field Radiative Thermal Transistor by Utilizing Distinct Phase Change Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) play a pivotal role in the development of advanced thermal devices due to their reversible phase transitions, which drastically modify their thermal and optical properties. In this study, we present an effective dynamic thermal transistor with an asymmetric design that employs distinct PCMs, vanadium dioxide (VO2) and germanium antimony telluride (GST), on either side of the gate terminal, which is the center of the control unit of the near-field thermal transistor. This asymmetry introduces unique thermal modulation capabilities, taking control of thermal radiation in the near-field regime. VO2 transitions from an insulating to a metallic state, while GST undergoes a reversible switch between amorphous (aGST) and crystalline (cGST) phases, each inducing substantial changes in thermal transport properties. By strategically combining these materials, the transistor exhibits enhanced functionality, dynamically switching between states of absorbing and releasing heat by tuning the temperature of gate. This gate terminal not only enables active and efficient thermal management but also provides effective opportunities for manipulating heat flow in radiative thermal circuits. Our findings highlight the potential of such asymmetrically structured thermal transistors in advancing applications across microelectronics, high-speed data processing, and sustainable energy systems, where precise and responsive thermal control is critical for performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advancing excited-state simulations for TADF emitters: An eXtended Tight-Binding framework for high-throughput screening and design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient framework for predicting the excited-state properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, integrating extended tight-binding (\xtb), simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (\stda), and simplified time-dependent density functional theory (\stddft) methods. Benchmarking against Tamm-Dancoff approximation (noted full \tda) demonstrates that this approach accurately captures key photophysical properties, including singlet-triplet energy gaps, excitation energies, and fluorescence spectra, in both vacuum and solvent environments, while achieving over 99\% reduction in computational cost. We analyze a series of representative TADF emitters, revealing a strong correlation between the torsional angle between donor and acceptor units and the solvent-induced redshift in the emission spectrum. This work highlights the potential of semi-empirical methods for high-throughput screening of TADF materials and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices. The multi-objective function is one of a kind, and it further enhances our results with an original solution. While acknowledging the limitations of semi-empirical methods for highly complex systems, we outline promising future directions, including hybrid computational approaches and integration with machine learning techniques, to further improve predictive accuracy and accelerate the discovery of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Isothermal Miscible Protein/Sugar Systems Driven by Marangoni Effects and Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through a combination of experiments and modeling, we have demonstrated a novel pattern formation phenomenon in an isothermal miscible fluid system involving simple protein and sugar solutions. We introduced dye-tagged protein solution into a petri dish with sugar solutions, which had higher density than the added protein solution. Initially, the protein spread and became more uniformly distributed at the air-water interface. Subsequently, it concentrated in specific areas to form spiral patterns. We propose that the mechanism involves an interplay between Marangoni effects, evaporation, and airflow. This finding is unexpected as solute Marangoni-related processes are generally characterized by fast spreading (seconds), while the pattern formation in our systems takes several minutes to form. Our work suggests that Turing reaction-diffusion patterns can be replicated by replacing the reaction-induced inhomogeneous solute distribution by evaporation-induced inhomogeneity. In both cases, the fast diffusive or Marangoni spreading of the solute is counteracted by a slower step that serves to reverse the solute homogenization. In showing that dissipative patterns can form in the absence of thermal gradients or chemical reactions, our findings significantly expand the conditions that lead to pattern formation. The insights gained also enhance our ability to manipulate and control fluid motion and surface morphology, with promising implications for many areas such as coating technologies, materials science, and microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Broadband Absorption in Cadmium Telluride Thin-Film Solar Cells via Composite Light Trapping Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composite light-trapping structures offer a promising approach to achieving broadband absorption and high efficiency in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) in order to accelerate sustainable energy solutions. As the leading material in thin-film solar technology, cadmium telluride (CdTe) faces challenges from surface reflective losses across the solar spectrum and weak absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) range. This computational study addresses these limitations by employing a dual light trapping technique: the top surfaces of both the CdS and CdTe layers are tapered as nanocones (NCs), while germanium (Ge) spherical nanoparticles (NPs) are embedded within the CdTe absorber layer to enhance broadband absorption. Numerical simulations using Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and other methods are used to optimize the parameters and configurations of both nanostructures, aiming to achieve peak optoelectronic performance. The results show that a short-circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 35.38 mA/$cm^2$ and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.76% can be achieved with optimal nanocone (NC) texturing and spherical Ge nanoparticle (NP) configurations, a 45.45% and 80.72% increase compared to baseline structure in $J_{sc}$ and PCE respectively. To understand the enhancement mechanisms, the study includes analyses using diffraction grating theory and Mie theory. Fabricability of these structures is also evaluated. Furthermore, an additional study on the effects of incident angle variation and polarization change demonstrates that the optimal structure is robust under practical conditions, maintaining consistent performance.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet High-Harmonic Interferometry of Excitation-Induced Bandgap Dynamics in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometry is a fundamental technique in physics, enabling precise measurements through the interference of waves. High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a powerful method for probing ultrafast electronic dynamics within crystalline structures.
  In this study, we employed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) high-harmonic interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulse pairs to investigate excitation-induced bandgap dynamics in solids. Our experiments on amorphous SiO2 and crystalline MgO, complemented by analytical modeling and semiconductor Bloch equation simulations, reveal a correlation between transient bandgap modifications and variations in the phase of harmonic emission. These findings suggest a potential pathway for sub-cycle, all-optical control of band structure modifications, advancing prospects for petahertz-scale electronic applications and attosecond diagnostics of carrier dynamics.</description>

      <title>Formation of Frustrated Charge Density Waves in Kagome Metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW), a translational symmetry breaking electronic liquid, plays a pivotal role in correlated quantum materials, such as high-T$_c$ superconductors and topological semimetals. Recently, CDWs that possibly intertwine with superconductivity and magnetism are observed in various kagome metals. However, the nature of CDWs and the role of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in these materials remain an unresolved challenge. In this letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a "yield sign"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly complete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2). The scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as decreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at Q$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short phase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first principles calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice interactions that are modulated by the FS topology. These results shed light on the interplay between FS and CDW in quantum materials with nearly degenerate structural deformation patterns.</description>

      <title>Orbital-excitation-dominated magnetization dissipation and quantum oscillation of Gilbert damping in Fe films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys, but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Heterogeneous Melting of Metals under Extreme Non-equilibrium States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extreme electron-ion nonequilibrium states created by ultrafast laser excitation challenge conventional melting paradigms. Through neural network-enhanced multiscale simulations of tungsten and gold nanofilms, we identify electronic pressure relaxation as a critical driver of heterogeneous phase transformations. Subpicosecond uniaxial expansion generates density decrease that enable surface-initiated melting far below equilibrium melting temperatures. This ultrafast heterogeneous melting propagates at 2500 m/s-tenfold faster than thermal mechanisms-with characteristic stationary diffraction peak splitting distinguishing it from thermal expansion dynamics. While tungsten shows pressure-driven solid-solid transitions, gold exhibits complete room-temperature amorphization under electronic stress. These results establish hot-electron-mediated lattice destabilization as a universal pathway for laser-induced structural transformations, providing new insights for interpreting time-resolved experiments and controlling laser-matter interactions.</description>

Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in non-centrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator $1T'$-WTe$_2$. Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.</description>

Abstract: FeSe(11) family has a simple crystal structure belonging to iron-based superconductors (FBS) and has many stable phases including hexagonal and tetragonal structures, but only the tetragonal phase exhibits the superconductivity. In this study, we have investigated the effects of chemical pressure induced by As-doping at Se-sites in the FeSe system by preparing a series of FeSe1-xAsx (x = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) bulks. A broad characterization has been performed on these samples using structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. The obtained lattice parameters are increased by As-doping, which suggests the successful insertion of As at Se-sites into the tetragonal lattice for low doping contents up to 5%, whereas the higher As-substitution appears in the form of the FeAs impurity phase. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of all samples has similar behaviour and depicts the highest onset transition temperature of around 11.5 K, but the zero resistivity is not reached until the measured temperature of 7 K, which could be due to the presence of the impurity phases. Our study suggests that a dopant with a large ionic radius, i.e., Arsenic, promotes the formation of the hexagonal phase of the 11 family and is effective for a small amount of doping level for the superconducting properties, whereas higher As-doping levels reduce the superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Large Seebeck coefficient driven by "pudding mold" flat band in hole-doped CuRhO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, of the metallic electronic structure of the hole-doped thermoelectric oxide CuRh$_{0.9}$Mg$_{0.1}$O$_2$. The material is found to have a ``pudding mold'' type band structure, with a nearly flat band edge located near the Fermi level, which is thought to be the origin of the thermoelectric behavior of this material. The experimental data match the density functional theory of the undoped parent compound, simply corrected by a rigid shift of the bands. Transport calculations based on the observed band structure yield a Seebeck coefficient of $\sim 200 \,\mu$V/K for the undoped parent material, consistent with experimental measurements. Our results show that CuRhO$_2$ is a textbook example of how pure band-structural effects can result in a large thermoelectric figure of merit, demonstrating that flat band edges in oxides are a realistic route for the efficient conversion of thermal energy.</description>

      <title>Assessing zero-shot generalisation behaviour in graph-neural-network interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: With the rapidly growing availability of machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) models for chemistry, much current research focuses on the development of generally applicable and ``foundational'' MLIPs. An important question in this context is whether, and how well, such models can transfer from one application domain to another. Here, we assess this transferability for an MLIP model at the interface of materials and molecular chemistry. Specifically, we study GO-MACE-23, a model designed for the extended covalent network of graphene oxide, and quantify its zero-shot performance for small, isolated molecules and chemical reactions outside its direct scope--in direct comparison with a state-of-the-art model which has been trained in-domain. Our work provides quantitative insight into the transfer and generalisation ability of graph-neural-network potentials and, more generally, makes a step towards the more widespread applicability of MLIPs in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Combining intrinsic and sliding-induced polarizations for multistates in two dimensional ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Going beyond the bistability paradigm of the charge polarizations in ferroelectrics is highly desired for ferroelectric (FE) memory devices toward ultra-high-density information storage. Here, we propose to build multistates by combining the intrinsic and sliding-induced polarizations. The physics is that there is at least one order of magnitude difference in the energy barriers between these two types of polarization, which leads to a significant difference in the electric fields for reversing the polarization. This difference, along with the symmetry breaking, allows for a unique flipping mechanism involving layer-by-layer sliding followed by layer-by-layer flipping during the transformation of the multistates. As a result, six and ten switchable states can be achieved for the 1T" bilayers and trilayers, respectively. We further illustrate the concept in H-stacking bilayers and trilayers of 1T" transition-metal dichalcogenides by first-principles calculations. Our study provides a new route to design novel polarization states for developing next-generation memory devices.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above room temperature as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: This work explores the topological properties of altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials. We employ equivariant K-theory of magnetic groups and Hamiltonian models to formulate a robust $C^z_4 \mathbb{T}$ topological invariant to classify 2D and 3D altermagnetic systems. Our findings demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological index, corresponding to the half-quantized Chern number of the divided Brillouin zone. This indicator enables the prediction of a topologically protected 2D altermagnetic insulators and 3D Weyl altermagnetic semimetals, highlighting the relationship between altermagnetism and topological phases. Furthermore, our results provide a pathway to the exploration of topological applications in $d$-wave altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimization for targeted self-assembly among competing polymorphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches for designing self-assembled materials focus on the thermodynamic stability of a target structure or crystal polymorph. Yet in practice, the outcome of a self-assembly process is often controlled by kinetic pathways. Here we present an efficient machine learning-guided design algorithm to identify globally optimal interaction potentials that maximize both the thermodynamic yield and kinetic accessibility of a target polymorph. We show that optimal potentials exist along a Pareto front, indicating the possibility of a trade-off between the thermodynamic and kinetic objectives. Although the extent of this trade-off depends on the target polymorph and the assembly conditions, we generically find that the trade-off arises from a competition among alternative polymorphs: The most kinetically optimal potentials, which favor the target polymorph on short timescales, tend to stabilize a competing polymorph at longer times. Our work establishes a general-purpose approach for multi-objective self-assembly optimization, reveals fundamental trade-offs between crystallization speed and defect formation in the presence of competing polymorphs, and suggests guiding principles for materials design algorithms that optimize for kinetic accessibility.</description>

Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal pronounced optical anisotropy along the $a$- and $c$-axis, as well as an unusual response associated with three-dimensional CDW order. Above $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$, there is a notable transfer of spectral weight (SW) from high to low energies, promoted by the magnetic splitting-induced shift in bands. Across the CDW transition, we observe a sudden SW transfer from low to high energies over a broad range, along with the emergence of new excitations around 1200 cm$^{-1}$. These results contrast with observations from other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs leads to a clear CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by a $2\times2\times2$ CDW ground state driven by a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, and charge order, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in FeGe.</description>

      <title>Enantiomer-Selective Magnetoresistance in Chiral Gold Nanocrystals by Magnetic Control of Surface Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral nanomaterials offer intriguing possibilities for novel electronic and chemical applications. Here, we report the discovery of an enantiomer-selective magnetoresistance effect in chiral gold nanocrystals. Based on precise control of nanocrystal chiral morphology using amino acid-directed synthesis, we demonstrate that an external magnetic field can dramatically modulate resistance in an enantiomer-specific manner. For a given enantiomer, a magnetic field in one direction alters the resistance by dozens of times, while the opposite field direction leaves it unchanged. This asymmetric response reverses for the opposite enantiomer and are reproduced in both single nanocrystals by conduction atomic force microscopy and nanocrystal thin films in solid state devices. We attribute this phenomenon to a chirality-driven charge pumping effect, where the interplay between the chiral morphology and the magnetic field selectively modifies the surface potential. The magnitude and sign of the magnetoresistance can be further tuned by the surface chemistry of the nanocrystal, as demonstrated through sulfide treatment. Our findings reveal a new form of chirality-dependent magnetoresistance, distinct from previously known effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity and electric magnetochiral anisotropy. The ability to remotely control surface potentials of chiral nanostructures using magnetic fields could enable novel approaches in catalysis, drug delivery, and nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Large Twist Angle Dependent Ultrafast Transient Dynamics of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals Heterostructures beyond the Mott Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures (HS) exhibit twist-angle ($\theta$) dependent interlayer charge transfer, driven by moir\'e potential that tunes the electronic band structure with varying $\theta$. Apart from the magic angles of $\sim$3$^\circ$ and $\sim$57.5$^\circ$ that show flat valence bands (twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer), the commensurate angles of 21.8$^\circ$ and 38.2$^\circ$ reveal the Umklapp light coupling of interlayer excitons. We report our results on non-degenerate optical pump-optical probe spectroscopy of MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ HS at large twist angles under high photoexcitation densities above the Mott transition threshold, generating interlayer localized charge carriers. We show that the recombination time of electrons and holes is minimum at the commensurate angles. The strength of non-radiative interlayer Auger recombination also shows a minimum at the commensurate angles. The fluence dependence of interlayer carrier recombination time suggests additional relaxation channels near the commensurate angles. This study emphasizes the significance of the large twist angle of HS in developing transition metal dichalcogenides-based optoelectronic devices.</description>
