      <title>A Survey on Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem in category theory and aims to detail the universal framework underlying self-reference and recursive structures. First, we rigorously define fundamental concepts - such as terminal objects, products, Cartesian Closed Categories, exponential objects, evaluation maps, currying, and point-surjective morphisms - and explain their intuitive meanings through concrete examples and commutative diagrams. Based on these foundational notions, we derive key lemmas (the universality of currying, the diagonal lemma, and the fixed-point construction lemma) and integrate them to develop a proof of Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of this theorem on fixed-point combinators in programming languages, type theory, and homotopy type theory, as well as current research trends and open problems. In doing so, we clarify how the abstract principle of self-reference contributes to a wide range of applications in both mathematics and computational theory.</description>

      <title>On abstract and concrete minions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is expository in nature. We analyze the connection between abstract minions, which can be described as functors from the category of finite ordinals to sets, and concrete minions, which are sets $\mathrm{Pol}(A, B)$ of polymorphisms $A^k \to B$ between relational structures $A$ and $B$. The functorial structure arises because a function $\alpha\colon n \to k$ transforms an $n$-ary polymorphism $f\colon A^n \to B$ to the polymorphism $(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}) \mapsto f(x_{\alpha (0)}, \ldots, x_{\alpha (n-1)})$. This data is relevant to the constraint satisfaction problems over finite domain, because minion homomorphisms $\mathrm{Pol}(A, B) \to \mathrm{Pol}(A', B')$ give rise to log-space reductions from the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\mathrm{PCSP}(A', B')$ to $\mathrm{PCSP}(A, B)$. Thus, they are valuable to understand the homomorphism order of polymorphism minions over finite-domain structures, especially since it is unknown whether the P vs. NP complexity dichotomy of constraint satisfaction problems extends to the more generalized promise setting.
  Crucially, although implicitly used in some papers to solve nontrivial problems, the concept of an abstract minion has not been exposed on so far, even though much is known about functor categories. The aim of this thesis is to start closing this gap, and to apply well-known constructions from category theory to minions. Furthermore, we identify a condition under which an abstract minion can arise as a concrete one over a finite domain, and deduce that many constructions remain stable under some of these concreteness assumptions. We will conclude that some of the homomorphism orders in question are uncountable distributive bounded lattices, and moreover (bi-) Heyting algebras. Along the way, we collect open questions related to abstract and concrete minions.</description>

      <title>Failure Modes for Structural Highness Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, entitled "Structural Highness Notions," we defined several classes of degrees that are high in senses related to computable structure theory. Each class of degrees is characterized by a structural feature (e.g., an isomorphism) that it can compute if such a feature exists. In this paper, we examine each of these classes and characterize them based on what they do if no such object exists.
  We describe, in particular, reticent, loquacious, and collegiate senses of being high. These, respectively, reflect the case where a computation from the degree can give output only if the desired feature exists, the case where it will give output of some kind whether or not the feature exists, and the case where the degree will either compute the feature or the best available approximation to it.</description>

      <title>The class of Aronszajn lines under epimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear order $A$ is called strongly surjective if for every non empty suborder $B \preceq A$, there is an epimorphism from $A$ onto $B$ (denoted by $B \trianglelefteq A$). We show, answering some questions of D\'aniel T. Soukup, that under $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_{1}}$ there is a strongly surjective Countryman line. We also study the general structure of the class of Aronszajn lines under $\trianglelefteq$, and compare it with the well known embeddability relation $\preceq$. Under $\mathsf{PFA}$, the class of Aronszajn lines and the class of countable linear orders enjoy similar nice properties when viewed under the embeddability relation; both are well-quasi-ordered and have a finite basis. We show that this analogy does not extend perfectly to the $\trianglelefteq$ relation; while it is known that the countable linear orders are still well-quasi-ordered under $\trianglelefteq$, we show that already in $\mathsf{ZFC}$ the class of Aronszajn lines has an infinite antichain, and under $\mathsf{MA}_{\aleph_{1}}$ an infinite decreasing chain as well. We show that some of the analogy survives by proving that under $\mathsf{PFA}$, for some carefully constructed Countryman line $C$, $C$ and $C^{\star}$ form a $\trianglelefteq$-basis for the class of Aronszajn lines. Finally we show that this does not extend to all uncountable linear orders by proving that there is never a finite $\trianglelefteq$-basis for the uncountable real orders.</description>

      <title>Jonsson and Magidor filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the filter versions of square bracket partition relations, focusing on Jonssonicity and Magidority. We show that the singular cardinals in a Kleinberg sequence above some strong partition cardinal are not Magidor, but the limit of the sequence is Magidor. This is done under AD. We also force over a model of AD to obtain a singular cardinal carrying a Magidor filter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the subvariety of quasi-MV* algebras in order to characterize the logic which is related to complex fuzzy logic. First, we give the definitions of strong quasi-MV* algebra and strong quasi-Wajsberg* algebra and show that they are term equivalence. Second, we present the representation theorem and the standard completeness of strong quasi-MV* algebras. Moreover, we discuss the properties of terms in the language of Wajsberg* algebras and strong quasi-Wajsberg* algebras. Finally, we establish the logical system associated with strong quasi-Wajsberg* algebra and prove that the logical system is sound and complete.</description>

      <title>The logic of quasi MV star algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-MV* algebras were introduced as generalizations of MV*-algebras and quasi-MV algebras. The recent investigation into quasi-MV* algebras shows that they are closely related to quantum computational logic and complex fuzzy logic. In this paper, we aim to study the logical system associated with quasi-MV* algebras in detail. First, we introduce quasi-Wajsberg* algebras as the term equivalence of quasi-MV* algebras and investigate the related properties of quasi-Wajsberg* algebras. Then we establish the logical system associated with quasi-Wajsberg* algebras using fewer deduction rules. Finally, we discuss the soundness of this logical system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of HOD for Admissible Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \geq 1$ and assume that there is a Woodin cardinal. For $x \in \mathbb{R}$ let $\alpha_x$ be the least $\beta$ such that
  \[
  L_\beta [x] \models \Sigma_n \text{-KP} + \exists \kappa (``\kappa \text{ is inaccessible and }\kappa^+ \text{ exists}").
  \]
  We adapt the analysis of $\text{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$ as a strategy mouse to $L_{\alpha_x}[x,G]$ for a cone of reals $x$. That is, we identify a mouse $\mathcal{M}^{\text{n-ad}}$ and define a class $H \subseteq L_{\alpha_x}[x,G]$ as a natural analogue of $\text{HOD}^{L[x,G]} \subseteq L[x,G]$, and show that $H = M_\infty[\Sigma_0]$, where $M_\infty$ is an iterate of $\mathcal{M}^{\text{n-ad}}$ and $\Sigma_0$ a fragment of its iteration strategy.</description>

      <title>Analogues of Shepherdson's Theorem for a language with exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1964 Shepherdson \cite{shepherdson:1964} proved that a discretely ordered semiring $\mathcal{M}^+$ satisfies $\sf{IOpen}$ (quantifier free induction) iff the corresponding ring $\mathcal{M}$ is an integer part of the real closure of the quotient field of $\mathcal{M}$. In this paper, we consider open induction schema in the language of arithmetic expanded by exponentiation or by the power function and try to find similar criteria for models of these theories.
  For several expansions $T$ of the theory of real closed fields we obtain analogues of Shepherdson's Theorem in the following sense: If an exponential field $\mathcal R$ is a model of $T$ and a discretely ordered ring $\mathcal M$ is an (exponential) integer part of $\mathcal R$, then $\mathcal M^+$ is a model of the open induction in the expanded language. The proof of the opposite implication, in general, remains an open question. However, we isolate a natural sufficient condition, related to the well-known Bernoulli inequality, under which this result holds. We define a finite extension $T$ of the usual open induction so that, for any discretely ordered ring $\mathcal M$, the semiring $\mathcal M^+$ satisfies $T$ iff there is an exponential real closed field $\mathcal R$ with the inequality $\exp(x) \geqslant 1 + x$ such that $\mathcal M$ is an exponential integer part of $\mathcal R$. Using these results, we obtain some concrete independence results for these theories.</description>

      <title>Mad families of Gowers' infinite block sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Call a subset of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ small if it does not contain a copy of $\langle{A\rangle}$ for some infinite block sequence $A \in \mathbf{FIN}_k^{[\infty]}$. Gowers' $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ theorem asserts that the set of small subsets of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ forms an ideal, so it is sensible to consider almost disjoint families of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ with respect to the ideal of small subsets of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$. We shall show that $\mathfrak{a}_{\mathbf{FIN}_k}$, the smallest possible cardinality of an infinite mad family of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$, is uncountable.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate Logic Contained in Medvedev's Logic with Disjunction Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\textbf{SU}$ be the superintuitionistic logic defined by the axiom $\boldsymbol{su} = ((\neg p\to q)\land(\neg q\to p) \rightarrow r \vee s) \to ( p \rightarrow r) \vee(q \rightarrow s)$, or equivalently, by Andrew's axiom. It is easy to check that $\textbf{SU}$ is contained in Medvedev's logic and contains both Kreisel-Putnam logic and Scott logic. We show that on \textbf{S4} frames, $\boldsymbol{su}$ corresponds to a certain first-order property, called the ``strong union'' property. The strong completeness of \textbf{SU}, with respect to the class of \textbf{S4} frames enjoying this property, is proved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that \textbf{SU} has the disjunction property. As a result, \textbf{SU} stands as the strongest logic currently known below Medvedev's logic that has both an axiomatization and the disjunction property.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem is a characterization of those infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs that admit infinite Eulerian paths. In this article we prove an effective version of the Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs where vertices of infinite degree are allowed, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean. Our results are obtained from a characterization of those finite paths in a graph that can be extended to infinite Eulerian paths.</description>

Abstract: We describe the classification of ranked definably quasi-Frobenius groups of odd type : dihedral configurations are isomorphic to PGL(2, K) for K an algebraically closed field of characteristic other than two; Frobenius groups are spilt and solvable if the characteristic of the underlying field is positive. To achieve this classification, we prove some results on ranked definably linear groups.</description>
