      <title>High-Precision Physics Experiments at Huizhou Large-Scale Scientific Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the capabilities presented by the High-Intensity Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the Accelerator-Driven Subcritical System (CiADS), as well as the proposed Chinese Advanced Nuclear Physics Research Facility (CNUF), we are assembling a consortium of experts in relevant disciplines--both domestically and internationally--to delineate high-precision physics experiments that leverage the state-of-the-art research environment afforded by CNUF. Our focus encompasses six primary domains of inquiry: hadron physics--including endeavors such as the super eta factory and investigations into light hadron structures; muon physics; neutrino physics; neutron physics; the testing of fundamental symmetries; and the exploration of quantum effects within nuclear physics, along with the utilization of vortex accelerators. We aim to foster a well-rounded portfolio of large, medium, and small-scale projects, thus unlocking new scientific avenues and optimizing the potential of the Huizhou large scientific facility. The aspiration for international leadership in scientific research will be a guiding principle in our strategic planning. This initiative will serve as a foundational reference for the Institute of Modern Physics in its strategic planning and goal-setting, ensuring alignment with its developmental objectives while striving to secure a competitive edge in technological advancement. Our ambition is to engage in substantive research within these realms of high-precision physics, to pursue groundbreaking discoveries, and to stimulate progress in China's nuclear physics landscape, positioning Huizhou as a preeminent global hub for advanced nuclear physics research.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Kadanoff--Baym formalism, we perform a detailed study of neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from strongly magnetized, dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\mu_{f} T)$ is small, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission. In the opposite limit, when the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Nucleon Coupling with Supergiant Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar environments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the $^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>A Universal Equilibration Condition for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic equilibration at late times is physically required for heavy particles in a finite temperature medium. In Fokker-Planck dynamics, it is ensured by the Einstein relation between the drag and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients. However, in certain gauge field theories, this relation is violated at any nonzero heavy quark velocity. Recent work in strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM gauge theory shows that the Kolmogorov equation for the heavy quark phase space distribution (that reduces to Fokker-Planck form upon truncating the momentum transfer probability distribution to second moments) does equilibrate even though the Fokker-Planck equation does not. Here, we generalize some of these (to date theory-specific) insights to any quantum field theory at any coupling strength. Starting from quantum field theory first principles, we derive a universal equilibration condition for the kernel of the Kolmogorov equation and, consequently, for the momentum transfer probability distribution. Remarkably, this condition reveals that the asymmetry between energy loss and energy gain in the momentum transfer probability distribution takes a simple, theory-independent, form.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium suppression in strongly coupled plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppression of open heavy quarks and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions are among the most informative probes of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise theoretical understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through a strongly coupled plasma. Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields. This chromoelectric correlator encodes all the characteristics of QGP that the dissociation and recombination dynamics of quarkonium are sensitive to, which is to say can in principle measure. We review its distinctive qualitative features at weak coupling in QCD up to next-to-leading order and at strong coupling in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM using the AdS/CFT correspondence, as well as its formulation in Euclidean QCD. Furthermore, we report on recent progress in applying our results to the calculation of the final quarkonium abundances after propagating through a cooling droplet of QGP, which illustrates how we may learn about QGP from quarkonium measurements. We devote special attention to how the presence of a strongly coupled plasma modifies the transport description of quarkonium, in comparison to approaches that rely on weak coupling approximations to describe quarkonium dissociation and recombination.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition and Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has profound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically study the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the transition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model frameworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different electroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime, we numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract key properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma and field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across models when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be captured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications. These results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent the first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Interplay of $95$ GeV Diphoton Excess and Dark Matter in Supersymmetric Triplet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the Higgs boson and the nature of dark matter remain fundamental challenges in particle physics. We investigate the $95$ GeV diphoton excess and dark matter within the framework of the triplet-extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (TMSSM). In this model, an additional Hypercharge $Y=0$, $SU(2)_L$ triplet superfield is introduced. Mixing between the triplet and doublet Higgs states enhances the diphoton signal strength of the $95$ GeV Higgs boson, resulting in $\mu_{\gamma\gamma}^{\text{CMS+ATLAS}} = 0.24_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$, which is consistent with experimental observations. This enhancement arises primarily from charged Higgs loop contributions. Additionally, the model accommodates viable dark matter candidates in the form of a bino-dominated neutralino. The relic density is reduced to the observed value through resonance-enhanced annihilation via the Higgs portal or co-annihilation with the triplino or higgsino. This reduction remains consistent with constraints from direct and indirect detection experiments. A comprehensive parameter scan demonstrates that the TMSSM can simultaneously explain the $95$ GeV diphoton excess, the observed $125$ GeV Higgs mass, and the dark matter relic density, establishing a compelling and theoretically consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $\Sigma^*$ via isospin selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isospin-selective reaction $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$ provides a clean probe for investigating $I=1$ $\Sigma^*$ resonances. In this work, we perform an analysis of this reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach for the first time, incorporating the well-established $\Sigma(1189) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1385) 3/2^+$, $\Sigma(1670) 3/2^-$, $\Sigma(1775) 5/2^-$ states, while also exploring contributions from other unestablished states.
  By fitting the available differential cross section and recoil polarization data, adhering to partial-wave phase conventions same as PDG, we find that besides the established resonances, contributions from $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$, $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$ and a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ improve the description.
  Notably, a $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ resonance with mass around 1.54 GeV, consistent with $\Sigma(1620)1/2^-$, is found to be essential for describing the data in this channel, a stronger indication than found in previous analyses focusing on $\pi\Lambda$ final states.
  While providing complementary support for $\Sigma(1660) 1/2^+$ and $\Sigma(1580) 3/2^-$, our results highlight the importance of the $\Sigma(1620) 1/2^-$ region in $K_Lp \to \pi^+\Sigma^0$. Future high-precision measurements are needed to solidify these findings and further constrain the $\Sigma^*$ spectrum.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $p\bar{\Omega}$ states and femtoscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent researches on the $p \Omega$ and $p \bar{\Lambda}$ systems, we investigate the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems within the framework of a quark model. Our results show that the attraction between a nucleon and $\bar{\Omega}$ is slightly stronger than that between a nucleon and $\Omega$, suggesting that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ system is more likely to form bound states. The dynamic calculations indicate that the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems with both $J^{P}=1^{-}$ and $2^{-}$ can form bound states, with binding energies deeper than those of the $p \Omega$ systems with $J^{P}=2^{+}$. The scattering phase shift and scattering parameter calculations also support the existence of $p \bar{\Omega}$ states. Additionally, we discuss the behavior of the femtoscopic correlation function for the $p \bar{\Omega}$ pairs for the first time. Considering the significant progress in experimental measurements of the correlation function of the $p \Omega$ system, the further study of the $p \bar{\Omega}$ systems using femtoscopic techniques will be a very valuable work.</description>

      <title>A radiative neutrino mass model with leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a radiative seesaw model with two leptoquarks under non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry. The leptons and quarks belong to non-trivial representations of the modular $A_4$ and the structures of their mass matrices are restricted. Neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level via leptoquark inside loop diagram where structures of relevant Yukawa interactions are determined by the modular $A_4$ symmetry. We scan the free parameters in the model and try to fit all the observed data for both lepton and quark sectors. For allowed parameters, we show some predictions regarding neutrino observables such as sum of neutrino mass and neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration reported a signal for a new resonance in the $D_s^+ \pi^\pm$ invariant mass distribution in the decays $B\to \bar{D}^{(*)} D_s^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ (arXiv:2411.03399). This could be a direct observation of an SU(3) flavor-sextet charmed meson with $J^P=0^+$. Such an SU(3) multiplet, is beyond the conventional quark-antiquark picture, and thus a verification of this observation is important.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall as Cosmological Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the domain wall within the framework of a cosmological harmonic oscillator. We investigate the interaction between the domain wall and a periodic background field, which can induce perturbations in the oscillatory behavior of the wall. We propose a novel mechanism for resolving the domain wall problem through the phenomenon of resonant oscillation. Resonant oscillation occurs when the frequency of the external driving force aligns with the intrinsic frequency of the domain wall. This synchrony can significantly amplify the amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a predetermined critical deformation threshold, the domain wall may be deconstructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism remains valid in models that preserve discrete symmetry.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

Abstract: By employing the extended most attractive channel hypothesis, we show that QCD-like gauge dynamics is possible in the dark-technicolour paradigm. The dark-technicolour paradigm can produce the mass of the Higgs boson, and at the same time, the $S$-parameter is also satisfied. Moreover, the dark-technicolour paradigm can provide a solution of the flavour problem by accommodating the standard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism within its framework. We present the inclusive collider signatures, such as $t\bar{t}$ and $\gamma \gamma$, of the lowest lying scalars and pseudoscalars of the dark-technicolour paradigm, for the scenarios, when the standard HVM or the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism are implemented within its framework. The collider signatures are investigated at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider, the high-energy Large Hadron Collider, and a 100 TeV future hadron collider. Several signatures are within the reach of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider. Additionally, one of the dark-Higgs of the model can address $95.4$ GeV excess reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Furthermore, one of the dark-Higgs can act like a new class of chirality-dependent dark-matter particles.</description>

Abstract: Glueballs and Hybrids are solid predictions of QCD, but none have this far been identified in an undisputable way.

      <title>Leptogenesis, $0\nu\beta\beta$ and lepton flavor violation in modular left-right asymmetric model with polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of supersymmetry, modular forms need not be holomorphic functions of the modulus $\tau$. Using this idea, we construct a non-supersymmetric framework using polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ forms. In this approach, the Yukawa coupling is no longer strictly holomorphic in $\tau$ but instead incorporates both holomorphic and non-holomorphic components. We realize a non-supersymmetric, left-right asymmetric model based on the $\Gamma_3$ modular group, where the active neutrino masses are generated via an extended inverse seesaw mechanism. The model successfully predicts the sum of neutrino masses below the current experimental bound and accommodates neutrino mixing angles within the $3\sigma$ range. Given its strong predictive power in neutrino oscillation parameters, we further explore its implications for beyond Standard Model (BSM) phenomena, including neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, lepton flavor violation (LFV), and baryogenesis via leptogenesis (BAU). Our findings indicate that the model predicts an effective Majorana mass and LFV branching ratios consistent with experimental constraints while also providing a viable explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the rich phenomenology of hadronic tau decays. These decays provide a unique window into the interplay of electroweak and strong interactions at low energies, as they occur primarily via $W$ exchange after the electroweak quark current hadronizes. In this manuscript, we summarize the basic ingredients required to perform precision physics studies in this sector. We detail the derivation of the different distributions within the Standard Model, discuss how to parametrize the non-perturbative QCD dynamics, and present methods commonly used to achieve clean theoretical predictions. Additionally, we briefly review how these distributions generalize in the presence of relatively heavy particles from beyond the Standard Model. This overview thus aims to serve as a useful starting point for readers interested in understanding how the only lepton capable of decaying into hadrons does so.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Thomson coefficient of quark-gluon plasma in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collision experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a unique platform to study several key properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter. Quarks, being the electrically charged particles, can induce an electric current in the medium in response to the temperature gradients. Hence, the QGP medium can behave like a thermoelectric medium. The thermoelectric coefficients, such as the Seebeck and Thomson coefficients, can help us to understand the intricate transport phenomenon of the medium. In peripheral collisions, the intense, transient, and time-dependent magnetic field created due to spectator protons significantly influences the thermoelectric properties of the QGP medium, affecting the charge and heat transport. This work uses the quasi-particle model to calculate the Thomson coefficient in QGP. The Thomson effect, describing the continuous heating or cooling of the charge-carrying medium in the presence of temperature gradients, remains largely unexplored in QGP. The Seebeck effect, which relates temperature gradients to induced electric fields, has been widely studied in the literature. For the first time, we calculate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. We have studied their dependence on temperature, baryon chemical potential, center of mass energy, and time-dependent magnetic field with different decay parameters. The transverse Thomson effect originates due to the presence of the Nernst effect in the presence of a magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the higher-order thermoelectric transport properties of the QGP medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Elliptic leading singularities and canonical integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of $\mathrm{dlog}$ integrands with unit leading singularities to the case covering integration of differential forms on elliptic curves. We first construct a special algebraic basis of integrands, including a differential one-form of the second kind, and match it to a Feynman integral ansatz in a suitable parametrization. Integration over a preferred basis cycle reveals their (elliptic) leading singularities. A simple transformation that sets all but one of the elliptic leading singularities to zero and normalizes the remaining one to unity then defines the canonical integrands. In several examples, we observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equation that has so far remained unnoticed. It factorizes component-wise either $\epsilon$ or $1 - n\,\epsilon$ with integer $n$, and evaluates order-by-order in $\epsilon$ to pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework connecting global symmetries to the relativistic $S$-matrix through the lens of quantum information theory. Analyzing the 2-to-2 scattering of particles of any helicity, we systematically characterize relativistic scattering amplitudes as quantum gates in the bipartite space of states with a discrete quantum number. This formalism naturally recovers and significantly extends previous results on entanglement suppression of the $S$-matrix, providing a comprehensive approach for studying the emergence of symmetries from an information-theoretic perspective. As a central result, we show that constraining the $S$-matrix to the span of minimally entangling operators is equivalent to realizing an emergent $SU(N)$ global symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cosmological-model independent limits on photon mass from FRB and SNe data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic emissions from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances can be used to estimate the photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$. In this paper, we combine measurements of the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) with the luminosity distance from type Ia supernovae (SNe) to investigate update constraints on the photon rest mass. We derive the expression of $\mathrm{DM}$ dependence concerning a non-vanishing photon mass from a cosmological-model independent approach and constrain the parameter $m_{\gamma}$ from measurements of 68 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We consider two scenarios for the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$): one where the value is fixed according to recent reports and another where it is treated as a free parameter, $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} = f_{\mathrm{IGM,0}}$. In the latter case, we find $m_{\gamma} = (29.4_{-15.5}^{+5.80}) \times 10^{-51}$ kg, at $1\sigma$ level. Our results also demonstrate an anticorrelation between $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ and $m_{\gamma}$, which highlights the importance of analyzing a larger sample of FRBs for a more comprehensive understanding of their properties.</description>

      <title>Do QGP Droplets Drive Anisotropy in Small Systems? Insights from RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for identified mesons and baryons are analyzed in large (Pb+Pb at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76\) and 5.02~TeV, Au+Au at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\)~GeV) and small (p+Pb at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02\) and 8.16~TeV, p+Au, d+Au, and \(^3\)He+Au at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\)~GeV) collision systems. The scaling functions' fidelity supports a hydrodynamic-like origin for the anisotropies in the flow-dominated regime. In large systems, anisotropies reflect QGP-driven expansion with strong radial flow and significant jet quenching. In small systems at RHIC, p+Au, d+Au, and \(^3\)He+Au show hadronic-dominated dynamics, with strong re-scattering, negligible radial flow, and suppressed jet quenching following the hierarchy: p+Au \(&gt;\) d+Au \(&gt;\) \(^3\)He+Au. At the LHC, ultra-central p+Pb collisions display enhanced radial flow, reduced re-scattering, and small but nonzero jet quenching. Scaling violations at high \(p_T\) reflect the partial suppression of partonic energy loss. These findings demonstrate that QGP-like behavior in small systems depends on both system size and beam energy, establishing the scaling framework as a robust tool for probing medium properties across diverse collision conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of isospin asymmetric nuclear medium on pseudoscalar and vector $B$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, using the light-front quark model, we examine how an isospin asymmetric nuclear medium affects the properties of pseudoscalar ($B^+, B^0$) and vector ($B^{\ast+}, B^{\ast0}$) mesons under different temperature values and degrees of isospin asymmetry. To simulate the in-medium modifications of the constituent quark masses, we employ the chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. Our analysis focuses on evaluating the effective masses, weak decay constants, and distribution amplitudes (DAs) of $B$ mesons in isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. The calculated vacuum values of the $B$ meson masses and decay constants show good agreement with existing experimental data, validating our approach to study the medium effects within the same framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muons offer a unique opportunity to build a compact high-energy electroweak collider at the 10 TeV scale. A Muon Collider enables direct access to the underlying simplicity of the Standard Model and unparalleled reach beyond it. It will be a paradigm-shifting tool for particle physics representing the first collider to combine the high-energy reach of a proton collider and the high precision of an electron-positron collider, yielding a physics potential significantly greater than the sum of its individual parts. A high-energy muon collider is the natural next step in the exploration of fundamental physics after the HL-LHC and a natural complement to a future low-energy Higgs factory. Such a facility would significantly broaden the scope of particle colliders, engaging the many frontiers of the high energy community.
  The last European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and later the Particle Physics Project Prioritisation Panel in the US requested a study of the muon collider, which is being carried on by the International Muon Collider Collaboration. In this comprehensive document we present the physics case, the state of the work on accelerator design and technology, and propose an R\&amp;D project that can make the muon collider a reality.</description>

      <title>Baryon asymmetry from higher-order matter contributions in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter by incorporating higher-order matter contributions in gravity, specifically analyzing gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $ f(R,\mathcal{T}^2) $ gravity, where $ R $ is the Ricci scalar and $ \mathcal{T}^2 \equiv T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu} $. We further explore the impact of high-order matter contributions by considering an interaction term analogous to those in gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, constructed using $ \mathcal{T}^2 $. The cutoff energy scale of the new interaction term is presented and its implications to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) are discussed. The properties and implications of this term are analyzed within the frameworks of General Relativity and $f(R, \mathcal{T}^2)$ gravity. Furthermore, a connection to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is established, providing an observational constraint on the functional form of $f(R, \mathcal{T}^2)$. By introducing $\mathcal{T}^2$ into the gravitational action, we propose that these modifications could significantly influence the early Universe's dynamics, thereby altering the conditions necessary for baryogenesis to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the factorization of the double nuclear modification factor in relativistic heavy ion collisions is tested for different types of final-state hadrons within the HYDJET++ model. The results demonstrate that this factorization holds reasonably well at moderately high transverse momenta, provided that the effects of double parton scattering can be small or neglected.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal dilepton production and anisotropic flow in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02 \, \mathrm{TeV}$ using next-to-leading-order (NLO) thermal QCD dilepton emission rates. A hybrid model (IP-Glasma+\kompost+MUSIC+UrQMD) simulates the collision evolution. The role of the pre-equilibrium stage in dilepton observables is examined. We also explore how chemical equilibrium in QCD matter affect dilepton observables.</description>

      <title>Holography and Causality in the Karch-Randall Braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the existence of a geodesic shortcut in the Karch-Randall (KR) braneworld rules out the possibility for a low-energy intermediate theory, even when gravity is turned off. We study this problem in an explicit example with two symmetrically placed KR branes. We find that there can be a consistent quantization of bulk matter fields with a holographic intermediate description. In our model, there is no causality violation. We use this example to study potential implications of the bulk geodesic shortcut. We find that there are possible enhancements of the correlation or entanglement between the two branes that is directly correlated with the extra-dimensional geometry. This could affect the low-energy regime when there are interactions between low and high energy modes. Our model makes it clear that any possible causality violation can only arise from the UV. Independently of the quantization, an intermediate description should be valid as an EFT.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass textures and associated phenomenology in modular left-right symmetric model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino mass textures play a crucial role in the study of various neutrino mass models and the associated phenomenology. The present work focuses on neutrino phenomenology in the framework of left-right symmetric model (LRSM) augmented by $A_4$ modular symmetry. More specifically we concentrated on the implementation of modular group of level 3 ($\Gamma(3)$). As the use of modular symmetry demands the assignment of different modular weights to the particle content of the model, we consider modular weights $k_Y$ = 4, 6, 8, 10 in LRSM which gives rise to different neutrino textures (texture zero structures) and study its consequent neutrino phenomenologies. Observables like resonant leptogenesis (RL), new physics contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD)(momentum dependent ($\lambda$ and $\eta$) and right-handed neutrino contributions of NDBD and lepton flavor violation (LFV) has been deliberated. The study has been carried out for both normal and inverted ordering of neutrino mass and the correlations among the neutrino parameters for the present model has been elaborated for the TeV scale LRSM which can be tested in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin Metrology with Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond for Axion Dark Matter Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to directly detect the axion dark matter using nitrogen vacancy centers in diamonds. In particular, we use metrology leveraging the nuclear spin of nitrogen to detect axion-nucleus couplings. This is achieved through protocols designed for dark matter searches, which introduce a novel approach of quantum sensing techniques based on the nitrogen vacancy center. Although the coupling strength of the magnetic fields with nuclear spins is three orders of magnitude smaller than that with electron spins for conventional magnetometry, the axion interaction strength with nuclear spins is the same order of magnitude as that with electron spins. Furthermore, we can take advantage of the long coherence time by using the nuclear spins for the axion dark matter detection. We show that our method is sensitive to a broad frequency range $\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ corresponding to the axion mass $m_a \lesssim 4\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We present the detection limit of our method for both the axion-neutron and the axion-proton couplings and discuss its significance in comparison with other proposed ideas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of polarized charged leptons from polarized nucleon targets and evaluated the polarized nucleon structure functions $g_{1N,2N}(x,Q^2)$ as well as the nucleon asymmetries $A_{1N,2N}(x,Q^2)$ for protons and neutrons. The higher order perturbative corrections up to the Next-to-Next-to-the-Leading Order (NNLO), using the parameterization of Polarized Parton Distribution Functions (PPDFs) given by Borsa, Stratmann, Vogelsang, de Florian and Sassot (BDSSV24) in the 3-flavor $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, along with the nonperturbative corrections$-$namely the twist-3 corrections and the Target Mass Corrections (TMC)$-$have been included in the calculations. The numerical results for the polarized nucleon structure functions, the nucleon asymmetries and the sum rule integrals of the nucleon structure functions$-$corresponding to the Ellis-Jaffe, Bjorken, and Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rules$-$have been evaluated numerically and are found to be in agreement with the experimental results from SLAC, CERN, DESY and JLab. The benchmarking of the PPDFs of BDSSV24 at NNLO using the present data on polarized nucleon structure functions and other observables will be useful in studying the nuclear medium effects in the scattering of the charged leptons from nuclei at the JLab, EIC, DESY, etc., and the scattering of the (anti)neutrinos from polarized nucleons and nuclei at the proposed neutrino factories.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections relating leptoquark-fermion couplings probed at low and high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar leptoquarks (LQ) with masses between 2 TeV and 50 TeV are prime candidates to explain deviations between measurements and Standard-Model predictions in decay observables of $b$-flavored hadrons (``flavor anomalies''). Explanations of low-energy data often involve order-one LQ-quark-lepton Yukawa couplings, especially when collider bounds enforce a large LQ mass. This calls for the calculation of radiative corrections involving these couplings. Studying such corrections to LQ-mediated $b\to c\tau \nu$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ amplitudes, we find that they can be absorbed into finite renormalizations of the LQ Yukawa couplings. If one wants to use Yukawa couplings extracted from low-energy data for the prediction of on-shell LQ decay rates, one must convert the low-energy couplings to their high-energy counterparts, which subsume the corrections to the on-shell LQ-quark-lepton vertex. We present compact formulae for these correction factors and find that in scenarios with $S_1$, $R_2$, or $S_3$ LQ the high-energy coupling is always smaller than the low-energy one, which weakens the impact of collider data on the determination of the allowed parameter spaces. For the $R_2$ scenario addressing $b\to c\tau \nu$, in which one of the two involved Yukawa coupling must be significantly larger than 1, we find this coupling reduced by 15\% at high energy. If both $S_1$ and $R_2$ are present, the high-energy coupling can also be larger and the size of the correction is unbounded, because tree contribution and vertex corrections involve different couplings. We further present the conversion formula to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme for the Yukawa couplings of the $S_3$ scenario.</description>

      <title>The impact of glasma on heavy flavor azimuthal correlations and spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological impact of the pre-equilibrium glasma initial stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quark azimuthal correlations and spectra. Using our numerical solver, we simulate the transport of heavy quark test particles in an SU(3) glasma background field. The glasma field equations are formulated using classical real-time lattice gauge theory, and the heavy quark dynamics are described by classical transport equations numerically solved using the colored particle-in-cell method. For the first time, the effect of the glasma stage on the azimuthal correlations of $c\overline{c}$ and $b\overline{b}$ pairs is studied. The resulting azimuthal width $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ exhibits a large and quick decorrelation due to the strong glasma fields. Further, we evaluate how the $p_T$-broadening in the glasma affects heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, which are initialized according to the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) heavy quark production calculation. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ is extracted for $c$ and $b$ quarks in the glasma and additional nuclear PDF effects accounting for gluon shadowing are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use classical equations of motion for heavy quarks to show that the pre-equilibrium glasma phase of a heavy ion collision has an extremely strong effect on heavy quark angular correlations. At the same time, the effect on the single inclusive spectrum is much more moderate. This suggests that $D\overline{D}$ meson angular correlations in future LHC measurements could provide direct experimental access to the physics of the pre-equilibrium stage.</description>

Abstract: For the $N$-point energy correlator in the collinear limit, the largest projected angle $R$ in the large $N$ limit can be viewed as the radius of the jet that encompasses all the collinear core particles, while contributions from soft gluons to the radius are suppressed. We relate the $N$-point energy correlator in the large $N$ limit to the moments of the fragmentation functions to a jet, and, using previous work, we compare the difference between jets initiated by heavy quarks and light quarks. This comparison reveals the deadcone effect.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Constraints from $B_s$, $D$, and $K$ Meson Mixing in $Z^\prime$ Models with Implications for $b\to s \nu\bar\nu$ Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within $Z^\prime$ models, neutral meson mixing severely constrains beyond the Standard Model (SM) effects in flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. However, in certain regions of the $Z^\prime$ parameter space, the contributions to meson mixing observables become negligibly small even for large $Z^\prime$ couplings. While this a priori allows for significant new physics (NP) effects in FCNC decays, we discuss how large $Z^\prime$ couplings in one neutral meson sector can generate effects in meson mixing observables of other neutral mesons, through correlations stemming from $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge invariance and through Renormalization Group (RG) effects in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). This is illustrated with the example of $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing, which in the presence of both left- and right-handed $Z^\prime bs$ couplings $\Delta_L^{bs}$ and $\Delta_R^{bs}$ remains SM-like for $\Delta_R^{bs}\approx 0.1\,\Delta_L^{bs}$. We show that in this case, large $Z^\prime bs$ couplings generate effects in $D$ and $K$ meson mixing observables, but that the $D$ and $K$ mixing constraints and the relation between $\Delta_R^{bs}$ and $\Delta_L^{bs}$ are fully compatible with a lepton flavour universality (LFU) conserving explanation of the most recent $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ experimental data without violating other constraints like $e^+ e^-\to\ell^+\ell^-$ scattering. Assuming LFU, invariance under the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry leads then to correlated effects in $b\to s\nu\bar\nu$ observables presently studied intensively by the Belle II experiment, which allow to probe the $Z^\prime$ parameter space that is opened up by the vanishing NP contributions to $B_s^0-\bar B_s^0$ mixing. In this scenario the suppression of $B\to K(K^*)\mu^+\mu^-$ branching ratios implies uniquely enhancements of $B\to K(K^*)\nu\bar\nu$ branching ratios up to $20\%$.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and Astrophysical Implications</title>

Abstract: I make a brief review about the QCD phases and the equation of state inferred from the neutron star data. Along the temperature axis at low baryon density, the QCD phase transition is a smooth crossover, and it is a natural extension of our imagination to postulate a similar crossover along the density axis at low temperature. Even without phase transitions, the inferred thermodynamic properties of neutron star matter turn out to be highly nontrivial already at twice of the nuclear saturation density. I also give some discussions about the substantiation of quark matter by means of the gravitational wave signals including the multi-messenger prospect.</description>

      <title>Tensor meson transition form factors in holographic QCD and the muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the prominence of tensor mesons in photon-photon collisions, until recently their contribution to the hadronic light-by-light (HLBL) scattering part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been estimated at the level of only a few $10^{-12}$, with an almost negligible contribution to the error budget of the Standard Model prediction. A recent reanalysis within the dispersive approach has found that after resolving the issue of kinematic singularities in previous approaches, a larger result is obtained, a few $10^{-11}$, and with opposite sign as in previous results, when a simple quark model for the transition form factors is employed. In this paper, we present the first complete evaluation of tensor meson contributions within a hard-wall model in holographic QCD, which reproduces surprisingly well mass, two-photon width, and the observed singly virtual transition form factors of the dominant $f_2(1270)$, requiring only that the energy-momentum tensor correlator is matched to the leading OPE result of QCD. Due to a second structure function that is absent in the quark model, the result for $a_\mu$ turns out to be positive instead of negative, and also with a magnitude of a few $10^{-11}$. We discuss both pole and non-pole contributions arising from tensor meson exchanges in the holographic HLBL amplitude, finding that keeping all contributions improves dramatically the convergence of a sum over excited tensor mesons and avoids unnaturally large contributions from the first few excited modes at low energies. Moreover, we find that the infinite tower of tensor mesons permits to fill the gap in the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint on the HLBL amplitude left by the contribution of axial vector mesons. Total $a_\mu^\mathrm{Tensor}$ contribution: $+12.4\times 10^{-11}$; with an $F_\rho$ fit this is reduced slightly to $+11.1\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Towards modeling the short-range interactions of hidden/open charm pentaquark molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic $\Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ and $\Sigma_c^{(*)}{D}^{(*)}$ interactions are revisited, with a focus on their short-range parts, motivated by a tension between the interpretations of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$ in effective field theory (EFT) frameworks and the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. While the three states can be interpreted as $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecular states within EFT frameworks, this is not feasible in the single-channel OBE model with consistent cutoff. In this work, the possibility to reconcile OBE model with EFTs by refitting the $\rho$-, $\omega$- and $\sigma$-exchange interaction is explored and ruled out. It is pointed out that the problem in OBE arises from the strong short-range spin-dependent one-pion-exchange (OPE) interaction and the fixed signs of other short-range interactions in OBE model also prevent the cancellation. To address this issue, the short-range subtraction strategies within the OBE model are revisited. Two subtraction schemes are explored: removing the delta-function from all interactions and eliminating it only from the pseudoscalar-meson-exchange component. These schemes favor different spin assignments for $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$. Though solving the problem, there is no clear dynamical picture to support the subtraction schemes. We propose a new quark-exchange mechanism motivated by the Pauli principle. Different from the two subtraction schemes in OBE, the quark-exchange mechanism offers an explanation grounded in microscopic dynamics. It is shown that the spin-dependent quark-exchange interaction cancels those from OPE. The differences in the predictions for the spin, isospin, and open-charm partner states of the experimental $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states offer a way to distinguish between the subtracted OBE model and the OBE model with quark-exchange contributions.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Symmetric Neutrino Mass Model without Scalar Bi-doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a left-right symmetric model with an $SU(2)_L$ and an $SU(2)_R$ scalar doublet but without the scalar bidoublet. The charged fermion masses in this model are generated via a universal seesaw mechanism. We add a set of three gauge singlet neutral fermions with Majorana masses of the order of a TeV. The masses for the left-handed neutrinos are naturally small in this model because they occur only at one-loop and are generated through a see-saw mechanism. By an appropriate choice of the Yukawa couplings of the $SU(2)_L$ doublet and the masses of the gauge singlet fermions, it is possible to implement resonant leptogenesis at TeV scale. The right-handed sector of the model, through appropriate values of the Yukawa couplings of the $SU(2)_R$ doublet, leads to a warm dark matter candidate in the lightest right-handed neutrino with a mass of a few keV and an observable effective electron mass for neutrinoless double beta decay $m_{\beta \beta}$.</description>

Abstract: We explore the application of the exact Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to two-level Floquet systems and establish a systematic procedure to calculate the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. We show that, in the exact-WKB analysis, the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of cycle integrals (Voros symbol), which characterize monodromy matrices for Schr\"odinger-type differential equations governing two-level Floquet systems. We analytically evaluate the cycle integrals using the low-frequency expansion and derive both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the quasi-energy and Floquet effective Hamiltonian. To verify the accuracy of our results, we compare them with numerical calculations and analyze resonant oscillations, which reveal non-perturbative features that cannot be captured by the perturbative expansion.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Inverse Seesaw Using $S_3$ Modular Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing neutrino masses using the inverse seesaw mechanism with discrete flavor symmetry imposed through modular forms provides a testable framework at TeV scales with fewer parameters. However, $S_3$, the smallest modular group, remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we construct the minimal supersymmetric inverse seesaw model based on the modular $S_3$ flavor symmetry. In our model, the light neutrino mass matrix depends on 6 real parameters: the complex modulus, an overall scale for light neutrino mass, a real ratio and a complex ratio of Yukawa coupling. Thanks to its minimality, our model offers various definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino masses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses ($\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta decay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for $\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next generation experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor violating decays $\ell\to\ell'\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Weakly supervised anomaly detection with event-level variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new topology for weakly supervised anomaly detection searches, di-object plus~X. In this topology, one looks for a resonance decaying to two standard model particles produced in association with other anomalous event activity (X). This additional activity is used for classification. We demonstrate how anomaly detection techniques which have been developed for di-jet searches focusing on jet substructure anomalies can be applied to event-level anomaly detection in this topology. To robustly capture event-level features of multi-particle kinematics, we employ new physically motivated variables derived from the geometric structure of a collision's phase space manifold. As a proof of concept, we explore the application of this approach to several benchmark signals in the di-$\tau$ plus~X final state. We demonstrate that our anomaly detection approach can reach discovery-level significances for signals that would be missed in a conventional bump-hunt approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Form Factors and the QCD Dilaton at Large Momentum Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hard scatterings of hadronic matrix elements corresponding to hadronic gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion and proton using QCD factorization, applying conformal field theory (CFT) tools. These GFFs are key to understanding quark and gluon angular momentum via their connection to DVCS moments. The core object is the non-Abelian \( TJJ \) 3-point function, which shows an anomaly-induced dilaton exchange in the \( t \)-channel. We analyze quark, ghost, and gauge-fixing effects through a CFT-based decomposition and propose a parameterization useful for future DVCS studies at the Electron-Ion Collider. The dilaton interaction is interpolated by a conformal anomaly form factor, defined in the nonconformal case, which is constrained by a (dilaton) sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

Abstract: The scattering amplitudes of string theory exhibit many extraordinary properties. But are they the unique mathematical objects to do so? Recently, it has been shown how the spectrum and amplitudes of open string theory follow directly from the assumptions of faster than power-law falloff at high energies and a property dubbed level truncation. At present there is no analogous principle for closed string scattering, which is famously rigid and naively impervious to modification. In this paper we analytically bootstrap the spectrum and four-point amplitudes of the closed string -- together with a parameterized space of deformations -- from conditions on high-energy falloff and level truncation. While these deformations exhibit the same Regge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce remarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of positivity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Newly calculated bounds on the strength of the coupling of an electron to a proton or a neutron by a fifth force are presented. These results are derived from the high precision spectroscopic data currently available for hydrogen, deuterium, helium-3 and helium-4. They do not depend on specific assumptions on how the interaction would couple to a deuteron compared to a proton or would couple to an $\alpha$ particle compared to a helion. They depend on its coupling to a muon, but not in a significant way for carrier masses below 100~keV if one assumes that the strength of the interaction with a muon would be of a similar order of magnitude as the strength of the interaction with an electron in that mass region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify a recently derived equations relating the renormalization group running of two gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED by the explicit three-loop calculation. It is demonstrated that these equations are really valid in the HD+MSL scheme. In other words, if a theory is regularized by higher covariant derivatives and the renormalization is made by minimal subtractions of logarithms, the analogs of the strong and electromagnetic gauge couplings do not run independently. However, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the considered equations do not hold starting from the three-loop order, where the scheme dependence becomes essential. Therefore, they are valid only for a certain set of the renormalization prescriptions. We prove that all of them can be obtained from the HD+MSL scheme by finite renormalizations which satisfy a special constraint and illustrate how this works in the three-loop approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

Abstract: The study of neutral $D$-meson mixing provides a unique probe of long-distance effects in the charm sector, where Standard Model contributions are dominated by nonperturbative effects. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spectral reconstruction techniques within lattice QCD to compute the long-distance contributions to $D^0- \bar{D}^0$ mixing. After outlining the general formalism describing neutral meson mixing in the charm sector, we focus on the determination of the mixing amplitudes and the dimensionless parameters $x = \Delta m_D / \Gamma_D$ and $y = \Delta \Gamma_D /(2 \Gamma_D)$, which respectively encode the mass and width differences between the $D$-meson mass eigenstates. We discuss in detail the required theoretical and computational framework, including the definition and renormalization of the four-quark operators entering the $\Delta C = 1$ weak Hamiltonian, and strategies for evaluating the relevant correlation functions employing variance-reduction techniques. To extract the mixing amplitudes, we explore methods for reconstructing the spectral density from lattice correlators, providing preliminary assessments of the data quality required to reach the scaling regime, where the smearing width is small enough to yield physically meaningful results. Our findings lay the groundwork for future precision determinations of long-distance contributions to $D$-meson mixing from first principles.</description>
