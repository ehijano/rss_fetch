      <title>Dynamic cluster field modeling of collective chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective migration of eukaryotic cells is often guided by chemotaxis, and is critical in several biological processes, such as cancer metastasis, wound healing, and embryogenesis. Understanding collective chemotaxis has challenged experimental, theoretical and computational scientists because cells can sense very small chemoattractant gradients that are tightly controlled by cell-cell interactions and the regulation of the chemoattractant distribution by the cells. Computational models of collective cell migration that offer a high-fidelity resolution of the cell motion and chemoattractant dynamics in the extracellular space have been limited to a small number of cells. Here, we present Dynamic cluster field modeling (DCF), a novel computational method that enables simulations of collective chemotaxis of cellular systems with O(1000) cells and high-resolution transport dynamics of the chemoattractant in the time-evolving extracellular space. We illustrate the efficiency and predictive capabilities of our approach by comparing our numerical simulations with experiments in multiple scenarios that involve chemoattractant secretion and uptake by the migrating cells, regulation of the attractant distribution by cell motion, and interactions of the chemoattractant with an enzyme. The proposed algorithm opens new opportunities to address outstanding problems that involve collective cell migration in the central nervous system, immune response and cancer metastasis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frequency in Second Messenger Signaling Quantifying cAMP Information Transmission in Bacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial second messengers are crucial for transmitting environmental information to cellular responses. However, quantifying their information transmission capacity remains challenging. Here, we engineer an isolated cAMP signaling channel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using targeted gene knockouts, optogenetics, and a fluorescent cAMP probe. This design allows precise optical control and real-time monitoring of cAMP dynamics. By integrating experimental data with information theory, we reveal an optimal frequency for light-mediated cAMP signaling that maximizes information transmission, reaching about 40 bits/h. This rate correlates strongly with cAMP degradation kinetics and employs a two-state encoding scheme. Our findings suggest a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation of multiple genes through temporal encoding of second messenger signals, providing new insights into bacterial adaptation strategies. This approach offers a framework for quantifying information processing in cellular signaling systems.</description>

      <title>Escape cascades as a behavioral contagion process with adaptive network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex behavioral contagion in collective evasion of mobile animal groups can be predicted by reconstructing quantitative interaction networks. Based on the assumption of time-scale separation between a fast contagion process and a slower movement response, the underlying interaction networks have been previously assumed to be static, determined by the spatial structure at the onset of the collective escape response. This idealization does not account for the temporal evolution of the spatial network structure, which may have a major impact on the behavioral contagion dynamics. Here, we propose a spatially-explicit, agent-based model for the coupling between behavioral contagion and the network dynamics originating from the spreading movement response. We explore the impact of movement parameters (startle speed, initial directionality, and directional noise) on average cascade size. By conducting numerical simulations for different density levels, we show that increasing escape speed suppresses the cascade size in most cases, that the cascade size depends strongly on the movement direction of the initially startled individual, and that large variability in the direction of individual escape movements (rotational noise) will typically promote the spread of behavioral contagion through spatial groups. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for movement dynamics in behavioral contagion, and facilitates our understanding of rapid coordinated response and collective information processing in animal groups.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous and Induced Oscillations in Confined Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>
