      <title>Comparison of Different Rydberg Atom-Based Microwave Electrometry Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have compared different Rydberg atom-based microwave electrometry techniques under the same experimental conditions and using the same Rydberg states ($68S_{1/2}$, $68P_{3/2}$ and $67P_{3/2}$). The comparison was carried out for the following techniques: i) Auxiliary microwave field, ii) Microwave amplitude modulation, and iii) Polarization spectroscopy. Our results indicate that all three techniques have a similar minimum measurable microwave electric field. A slightly better result can be obtained by performing polarization spectroscopy using a Laguerre-Gauss coupling laser beam.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop and Multi-axis Atomtronic Sagnac Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of sequential tunnel ionization in ultrashort electromagnetic pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider double ionization of negative bromine ion ${\rm Br}^-$ in intense linearly polarized low-frequency laser fields. By solving numerically the two-electron time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation we demonstrate that while for electromagnetic pulses of a few tens of femtoseconds duration and longer the sequential single-electron approximation perfectly describes the ionization dynamics, for pulses as short as a few femtoseconds this picture breaks down entirely, and the electron-electron interaction suppresses the rate of ionization by approximately one order of magnitude. We also show weak but clear signatures of the collective tunneling effect in the photoelectron density distribution.</description>

      <title>Linear dichroism signals due to the alignment in the ground state of hydrogen-like atoms and their inversion in a single-beam optical pumping scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of theoretical and experimental investigation of optical linear dichroism signals caused by alignment, and arising under the action of pumping with linearly polarized light in a magnetic field transverse to the pumping in an ensemble of hydrogen-like (including alkali) atoms. Several simple models implying mixing of Zeeman sublevels of the excited state are considered, and common patterns among them are identified. It is shown that in the general case the properties of the medium causing dichroism can be characterized by only two parameters, {\Delta}x and {\Delta}y, while in the case of complete mixing - by a single parameter {\Delta}. Expressions that relate these parameters to the transition probabilities are provided, as is an extension of the theory for the case of incomplete mixing of sublevels of the excited state. The single-beam scheme for recording linear dichroism signals, which is of greatest interest from a practical point of view, is investigated. It is shown that incomplete mixing can lead to inversion of dichroism signals in systems including more than one optical transition. A comparison with the results of an experimental study of dichroism in alkali metal (cesium) vapors is made.</description>

      <title>Parallel assembly of neutral atom arrays with an SLM using linear phase interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present fast parallel rearrangement of single atoms in optical tweezers into arbitrary geometries by updating holograms displayed by an ultra fast spatial light modulator. Using linear interpolation of the tweezer position and the optical phase between the start and end arrays, we can calculate and display holograms every few ms, limited by technology. To show the versatility of our method, we sort the same atomic sample into multiple geometries with success probabilities of 0.996(2) per rearrangement cycle. This makes the method a useful tool for rearranging large atom arrays for quantum computation and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.</description>
