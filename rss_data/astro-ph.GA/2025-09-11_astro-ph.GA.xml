      <title>Bright [CII]158$\mu$m Streamers as a Beacon for Giant Galaxy Formation in SPT2349$-$56 at $z=4.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of extreme starbursts, often located in the cores of protoclusters, challenge the classical bottom-up galaxy formation paradigm. Giant elliptical galaxies at $z=0$ must have assembled rapidly, possibly within few 100 Myr through an extreme growth phase at high-redshift, characterized by elevated star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year distributed over concurrent, gas-rich mergers. We present a novel view of the $z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust continuum and [CII]158$\mu$m line observations. Distributed across 60 kpc, a highly structured gas reservoir with a line luminosity of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}=3.0\pm0.2\times10^9$ $L_\odot$ and an inferred cold gas mass of $M_{gas}= 8.9\pm0.7\times10^{9}$ $M_\odot$ is found surrounding the central massive galaxy triplet. Like ``beads on a string'', the newly-discovered [CII] streamers fragment into a few kpc-spaced and turbulent clumps that have a similar column density as local Universe spiral galaxy arms at $\Sigma_{gas}=20$--$60$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. For a dust temperature of 30 K, the [CII] emission from the ejected clumps carry $\gtrsim$3% of the FIR luminosity, translating into an exceptionally low mass-to-light ratio of $\alpha_\mathrm{[CII]}=2.95\pm0.3$ $M_\odot$ $L_\odot^{-1}$, indicative of shock-heated molecular gas. In phase space, about half of the galaxies in the protocluster core populate the same caustic as the [CII] streamers ($r/r_{vir}\times|\Delta v|/\sigma_{vir}\approx0.1$), suggesting angular momentum dissipation via tidal ejection while the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is assembling. Our findings provide new evidence for the importance of tidal ejections of [CII]-bright, shocked material following multiple major mergers that might represent a landmark phase in the $z\gtrsim4$ co-evolution of BCGs with their hot, metal enriched atmospheres.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web galaxy groups: Evolution of red sequence and quiescent galaxy fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift and group richness dependence of the quiescent fraction and red-sequence (RS) parameters in COSMOS galaxy groups from z=0 to z=3.7. We analyzed the deep and well-characterized sample of groups detected with AMICO in the COSMOS(-Web) field. Our study of the quiescent galaxy population is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on rest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to estimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision and recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy fractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership probabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another using a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the ridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove outliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame magnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both approaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS parameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up steadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in the richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \sim 2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare overdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant early RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint groups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones, likely reflecting their typical location in filaments. Leveraging the broad wavelength coverage of COSMOS2025, we traced RS evolution over $\sim 12$ Gyr, finding no significant trends in either slope or scatter of the ridgeline.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the supermassive black hole abundance and implications for the GW background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present-day mass function of supermassive black holes is the most important observable quantity for the prediction and theoretical interpretation of the gravitational wave background (GWB) measured by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred SMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with the black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\bullet}-X$), which can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement of the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass function is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations and galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the characteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass proxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both catalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce significant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore measurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a set of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This enables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies in the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic biases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3 proxies: the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a combination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane. We show that all three can be reconciled to some degree, but highlight the remaining dependence on poorly-quantified systematic corrections between the scaling relation catalogs and the mass function catalogs, as well as the potential impact of selection effects.</description>

      <title>The \emph{JWST} Emission Line Survey (JELS): The sizes and merger fraction of star-forming galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used observations from the \emph{JWST} Emission Line Survey (JELS) to measure the half-light radii ($r_{e}$) of 23 H$\alpha$-emitting star-forming (SF) galaxies at $z=6.1$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field. Galaxy sizes were measured in \emph{JWST} Near-infrared Camera observations in rest-frame H$\alpha$ (tracing recent star formation) with the F466N and F470N narrowband filters from JELS, and compared against rest-$R$-band, $V$-band (tracing established stellar populations) and near-ultraviolet sizes. We find a size-stellar mass ($r_{e}-M_{*}$) relationship with a slope that is consistent with literature values at lower redshifts, though offset to lower sizes. We observe a large scatter in $r_{e}$ at low stellar mass ($M_{*}&lt;10^{8.4}$ M$_{\odot}$) which we believe is the result of bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of SF galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We find that the stellar and ionised gas components are similar in size at $z=6.1$. The evidence of already-established stellar components in these H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) indicates previous episodes of star formation have occurred. As such, following other JELS studies finding our HAEs are undergoing a current burst of star formation, we believe our results indicate that SF galaxies at the end of the EoR have already experienced a bursty SFH. From our $r_{e}-M_{*}$ relationship, we find $r_{e, \text{F444W}}=0.76\pm0.46$ kpc for fixed stellar mass $M_{*}=10^{9.25}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is in agreement with other observations and simulations of star forming galaxies in the literature. We find a close-pair (major) merger fraction of ($f_{\text{maj. merger}}=0.44\pm0.22$) $f_{\text{merger}}=0.43\pm0.11$ for galaxy separations $d\lesssim25$ kpc, which is in agreement with other $z\approx6$ studies.</description>

      <title>The WISSH quasar project. XII. X-ray view of the most luminous quasi-stellar objects at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve our knowledge of nuclear emission in luminous QSOs at Cosmic Noon, we studied the X-ray emission of the WISE/SDSS-selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) QSO sample: 85 broad-line AGN with $L_{bol}&gt;few\times 10^{47}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at $z\sim 2-4$. Our aim is to characterise their X-ray spectra and explore relations between X-ray luminosity and other bands, comparing powerful QSOs with the general AGN population. We performed spectral analysis for about half of the sample; 16 sources were analysed via their hardness ratio; for the others we estimated their intrinsic luminosity $L_{2-10\,keV}$. Only 8 sources are undetected. We report a large dispersion in $L_{2-10\,keV}$ despite the narrow distribution of $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ and $\lambda L_{6\,\mu m}$ (about one-third of the sources classified as X-ray weak). This suggests differences in X-ray corona and accretion flow physics between hyper-luminous and less powerful AGN. X-ray photon index distribution is consistent with that of lower-$z$, lower-$L_{bol}$ AGN, and does not depend on the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{Edd}$) or X-ray weakness. Most WISSH QSOs with intrinsic absorption estimates show little to no obscuration ($N_H \le 5\times 10^{22}\,cm^{-2}$). Among the obscured sources we find blue QSOs without broad absorption lines within the "forbidden region" of the $Log(N_H)-Log(\lambda_{Edd})$ plane, typically occupied by dust-reddened QSOs and associated with intense feedback. We confirm a correlation between $L_{2-10\,keV}$ and CIV line blueshift, a tracer of nuclear ionized outflows. Multi-wavelength data and complete X-ray coverage enabled the investigation of the disk-corona interplay at the highest luminosity regimes. The broad distribution of bolometric correction and X-ray - to - optical index suggest caution when using $L_{bol}$, $L_{2500\,\r{A}}$ or $L_{6\,\mu m}$ as direct X-ray proxy for individual luminous QSOs.</description>

      <title>Via Machinae 3.0: A search for stellar streams in Gaia with the CATHODE algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the model-agnostic anomaly detection method Cathode - originally developed for particle physics - to search for stellar streams in Gaia data. We combine Cathode with Via Machinae 3.0: a re-optimized version of the stellar stream detection method that was previously applied to Gaia data together with the related anomaly detection technique Anode. We demonstrate that the combination of Via Machinae 3.0 with Cathode, called VM3-C, not only re-discovers previously known streams, but also confirms many candidate streams identified in combination with Anode (denoted VM3-A). Compared to VM3-A, the number of stream candidates detected by VM3-C increases by around 10%. Moreover, both of the methods discover the same two large clusters of stream candidates in the Northern Galactic hemisphere. We dub these highly significant anomalous structures the Raritan stream and the Passaic stream. These two structures may indicate the presence of larger objects, such as dwarf galaxy streams, or non-trivial orbital dynamics resulting in bifurcation or fanning, and are promising and high-priority targets for further analysis.</description>

      <title>Candidate gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxies in Herschel-ATLAS associated with WISE elliptical counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new and independent methodology for identifying gravitational lens candidates using data from the H-ATLAS and AllWISE surveys. Unlike previous approaches, which are typically biased toward bright, strongly lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), our method uncovers fainter systems with lower magnifications. This enables the identification and individual study of lensing events that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing analyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range $1.2 &lt; z &lt; 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular distance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors ($0.5 &lt; \mathrm{W2} - \mathrm{W3} &lt; 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of elliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\mathrm{W1}$ color and photometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination. This conservative selection yields 68 new lens candidates. We then performed SED fitting with CIGALE across UV to submillimeter wavelengths to estimate the physical properties of both the lenses and the background SMGs, and to assess the lensing nature of these candidates. Despite the uncertainties, we were able to constrain key parameters such as stellar and dust masses, infrared luminosities, and star formation rates. In addition, the estimated magnifications for most candidates are modest, consistent with the weak lensing regime ($\mu \simeq 1{-}1.5$), although a few sources may require more precise modeling. Future efforts could refine this methodology to recover potential candidates outside our selection, and high-resolution follow-up observations will be essential to confirm the lensing nature of these sources and to further investigate their physical properties.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS survey: Jeans anisotropic models of edge-on discs uncover the impact of dust and kinematic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central regions of disc galaxies host a rich variety of stellar structures: nuclear discs, bars, bulges, and boxy-peanut (BP) bulges. These components are often difficult to disentangle, both photometrically and kinematically, particularly in star-forming galaxies where dust obscuration and complex stellar motions complicate interpretation. In this work, we use data from the GECKOS-MUSE survey to investigate the impact of dust on axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) models, and assess their ability to recover kinematic structure in edge-on disc galaxies. We construct JAM models for a sample of seven edge-on ($i \gtrapprox 85^\circ$) galaxies that span a range of star formation rates, dust content, and kinematic complexity. We find that when dust is appropriately masked, the disc regions of each galaxy are fit to $\chi^2_{\text{reduced}}\leq 5$. We analyse two-dimensional residual velocity fields to identify signatures of non-axisymmetric structure. We find that derived dynamical masses are constant within 10% for each galaxy across all dust masking levels. In NGC 3957, a barred boxy galaxy in our sample, we identify velocity residuals that persist even under aggressive dust masking, aligned with bar orbits and supported by photometric bar signatures. We extend this analysis to reveal a bar in IC 1711 and a possible side-on bar in NGC 0522. Our results highlight both the capabilities and limitations of JAM in dusty, edge-on systems and attempt to link residual velocities to known non-axisymmetric kinematic structure.</description>

      <title>The Critical 9365 {\AA} Diffuse Interstellar Band and C$_{60}^{+}$ Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of interstellar C$_{60}^{+}$ has been debated for 30 years. The contested attribution of a weaker DIB at 9365 {\AA} was re-evaluated here on the basis of a Pearson correlation relative to 9577 {\AA}, which was previously tied to C$_{60}^{+}$ by diverse collaborations. An assessment of 11 sightlines revealed a high correlation amongst 9365$-$9577 {\AA} equivalent widths ($r=0.93 \pm 0.05$), after contamination from an adjacent line was mitigated using both numerical integration and Gaussian fits. In tandem with a recent separate study's high-$r$ evaluation linking 9577$-$9632 {\AA} across a sizable baseline: three interrelated DIBs matching C$_{60}^{+}$ laboratory findings were independently reaffirmed (9365, 9577, 9632 {\AA}). Yet further investigations are required to strengthen the case via two other weak DIBs disputedly linked to C$_{60}^{+}$, particularly owing to potential overlapping lines arising from an expansive chemical space (PAHs).</description>

      <title>Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $&lt;55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution.
  New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus.
  The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.</description>

      <title>The Small Magellanic Cloud through the lens of the James Webb Space Telescope : binaries and mass function within the galaxy outskirts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems are fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one of the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming regions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we exploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\rm F322W2}$ versus $m_{\rm F115W}-m_{\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary systems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\rm bin}^{q&gt;0.6}=0.14\pm0.01$, consistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity distribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC field is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way field stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and evolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the luminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass function (MF) down to $0.22\,M_{\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the SMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of $\alpha=-1.99\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter slope of $\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in low-metallicity and low-density environments.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we search for empirical relationships for irregular dwarf galaxies using a collection of observational data published in the NASA and HyperLeda databases. Us- ing a complex statistical analysis, we calculated correlation coefficients between various physical parameters of irregular dwarf galaxies. We found strong correlations between mass and distance, apparent stellar magnitude and distance, mass and absolute mag- nitude, redshift, and mass for all types of irregular dwarf galaxies as well as for their individual types.</description>

      <title>Frequent Extreme Galaxy-scale Outflows among Luminous Early Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just $\sim$1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z $\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$ and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\sim$260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\gtrsim$6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\sim$ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z $&lt;$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a $z \sim 0.8$ Ultra Steep Spectrum Radio Halo in the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio halos are diffuse synchrotron sources that trace the turbulent intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. However, their origin remains unknown. Two main formation models have been proposed: the hadronic model, in which relativistic electrons are continuously injected by cosmic-ray protons; and the leptonic turbulent re-acceleration model, where cluster mergers re-energise electrons in situ. A key discriminant between the two models would be the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only be produced through turbulent re-acceleration. Here we report the discovery of an USSRH in the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2337$-$5942 at redshift $z = 0.78$ in the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope 100 deg$^2$ survey. This discovery is noteworthy for two primary reasons: it is the highest redshift USSRH system to date; and the close correspondence of the radio emission with the thermal ICM as traced by $\mathit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations, further supporting the leptonic re-acceleration model. The halo is under-luminous for its mass, consistent with a minor merger origin, which produces steep-spectrum, lower luminosity halos. This result demonstrates the power of wide-field, high-fidelity, $\lesssim1$ GHz surveys like the MeerKAT-SPT 100 deg$^2$ programme to probe the origin and evolution of radio halos over cosmic time, ahead of the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Analysis of mass-transferring binary candidates in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer between stars in binary systems profoundly impacts their evolution, yet many aspects of this process (especially the stability, mass loss, and eventual fate of such systems) remain poorly understood. One promising avenue to constrain these processes is through the identification and characterisation of systems undergoing active mass transfer. Inspired by the slow brightening preceding stellar merger transients, we worked on a method to identify Galactic mass-transferring binaries in which the donor is a Hertzsprung gap (HG) star. We constructed an initial sample of HG stars using the Gaia EDR3 contribution Starhorse catalogue, and we identified candidate mass-transferring systems by selecting sources that exhibit Balmer emission features (using the low-resolution Gaia XP spectra), mid-infrared excess (from WISE photometry), and photometric variability (inferred from the error in the Gaia G-band magnitude). This multi-criteria selection yielded a sample of 67 candidates, which we further analysed using complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Among our candidates, we identified at least nine eclipsing binaries and some sources that are potential binaries as well. Three sources in our sample are strong candidates for mass-transferring binaries with a yellow component, and three more are binaries with a Be star. Notably, four sources in our sample are strong candidates for hosting a compact companion, based on their UV or X-ray signatures. The main sources of contamination in our search are hot but highly reddened stars (primarily Oe and Be stars). As an additional outcome of this work, we present a refined catalogue of 308 bona fide HG stars, selected using improved extinction corrections and stricter emission-line criteria. This enhanced sample is expected to contain a significantly higher fraction of scientifically valuable mass-transferring binaries.</description>

      <title>X-ray Transmission Through Photoionized Gas with Moderate Thomson Optical Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the absorption of X-rays by gas obscuring the source and photoionized by it. We consider a broad range of column densities, including both Thomson-thin and Thomson-thick media. For the Thomson thin regime, we derive a simple criterion, based on the source luminosity and spectrum and the medium radius and column density, that distinguish between the following cases: (i) The absorption can be modeled well by a neutral medium; (ii) The radiation ionizes its way through the medium and no absorption is expected; and (iii) A detailed model is required because the column density inferred from modeling the absorption with a neutral gas is much lower than the actual column density, or because the absorption features cannot be fitted by a neutral absorber. We derive the criterion analytically using a toy model of hydrogen and oxygen, and calibrate it for realistic compositions with metallicities in the range $Z/Z_{\odot}=0.01-50$, using CLOUDY. We generalize the model to the Thomson-thick regime, where we consider, alongside photoabsorption, electron scattering, Compton heating, Comptonization, and photon degradation. In this case, the emergent spectrum depends on the boundary condition experienced by photons scattered back towards the source. We discuss the effect of a reflective boundary and a reprocessing boundary. We provide simple criteria for the expected absorption state, and discuss additional effects that alter the spectrum. The main motivation of our modeling is X-ray emission from supernovae interacting with circumstellar medium; however, we expect it to be useful to many other applications.</description>

      <title>Toward a 2D H I Map of the Local Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a complete census of gas in the local interstellar medium (&lt;100 pc) is challenging given the limited available tracers of the warm, partially-ionized medium. Medium-to-high resolution UV absorption spectroscopy toward individual nearby stars is the primary method used, and incomplete spatial sampling of this complex medium makes a global map of the material difficult. Using H I column density measurements derived from H I Lyman alpha spectroscopy toward 164 stars inside 100 pc, we have generated 2D spatially-interpolated N(HI) maps for different distance shells. Based on the area-weighted sky averages, we find that sightlines inside 10 pc typically have log N(HI) ~ 17.9. For greater distance shells, log N(HI) increases to 18.3 (10-20 pc), then to 18.4 (20-70 pc), and finally increasing to 18.6 (70-100 pc). This last increase is likely associated with the detection of the Local Bubble boundary, thus making the plateau of column density from 20-70 pc notable and suggestive of the rarity of warm LISM material beyond ~10-20 pc. We estimate that the uncertainties associated with N(HI) values inferred from the interpolated sky maps are approximately inversely correlated with the number of samples in each distance shell and are in the range of 0.20-0.48 dex, compared to 0.01-0.30 dex typically determined from direct Lyman alpha observations. We discuss the impact of these uncertainties on ISM corrections of EUV and Lyman alpha observations for nearby stars. Denser spatial sampling of the sky via UV absorption spectroscopy of nearby stars is required to improve the accuracy of these N(HI) estimates.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: Fundamental Physics and Galactic Habitability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchical Merger Scenario for GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 exhibits exceedingly massive components and high spins, which challenges the formation of first-generation (1G) black holes from stellar collapse and implies that this event might originate from hierarchical mergers. Here we show that the \texttt{2G+2G} merger scenario for GW231123 is favored over a \texttt{2G+1G} (or \texttt{3G+2G}) merger, with odds ratios of $&gt;$$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The primary (secondary) black hole is consistent with merging binary black holes with masses of $75^{+7}_{-7}\,M_\odot$ and $66^{+4}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ ($64^{+8}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ and $59^{+7}_{-9}\,M_\odot$; 90\% credible intervals), respectively. Our results reveal that the treatment of spin priors from the population level and waveform model choice are decisive in interpreting potential hierarchical gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM II. Cross-calibration of X-ray instruments used in the large, multi-mission observational campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate X-ray spectroscopic measurements are fundamental for deriving basic physical parameters of the most abundant baryon components in the Universe. The plethora of X-ray observatories currently operational enables a panchromatic view of the high-energy emission of celestial sources. However, uncertainties in the energy-dependent calibration of the instrument transfer functions (e.g. the effective area, energy redistribution, or gain) can limit - and historically, did limit - the accuracy of X-ray spectroscopic measurements.
  We revised the status of the cross-calibration among the scientific payload on board four operation missions: Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and the recently launched XRISM. XRISM carries the micro-calorimeter Resolve, which yields the best energy resolution at energies above 2 keV. For this purpose, we used the data from a 10-day-long observational campaign targeting the nearby active galactic nucleus NGC 3783, carried out in July 2024.
  We present a novel model-independent method for assessing the cross-calibration status that is based on a multi-node spline of the spectra with the highest-resolving power (XRISM/Resolve in our campaign). We also estimated the impact of the intrinsic variability of NGC 3783 on the cross-calibration status due to the different time coverages of participating observatories and performed an empirical reassessment of the Resolve throughput at low energies.
  Based on this analysis, we derived a set of energy-dependent correction factors of the observed responses, enabling a statistically robust analysis of the whole spectral dataset. They will be employed in subsequent papers describing the astrophysical results of the campaign.</description>

      <title>Prediscovery Activity of New Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: A Dynamically-Old Comet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the prediscovery observations and constraints of the new interstellar comet 3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS), made by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), for the inbound leg of the comet out to a heliocentric distance of $r_\mathrm{h}=17$ au, or approximately a year before its discovery. We find that 3I/ATLAS has been active inward of a heliocentric distance of at least $r_\mathrm{h}=6.5$ au. The comet followed a brightening rate of $\propto r_\mathrm{h}^{-3.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the only other known interstellar comet 2I/Borisov, and is more consistent with dynamically old long-period comets and short-period comets in the Solar System. By measuring the brightening of the dust coma, we estimate that 3I had a dust production rate of $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim5 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ in early May of 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim6$ au), increasing to $\dot{M_\mathrm{d}}\sim30 \mathrm{kg s^{-1}}$ towards mid-July 2025 ($r_\mathrm{h}\sim4$ au) assuming 100 micron dust grains, in line with the more recent Hubble Space Telescope measurement made at $r_\mathrm{h}=3.8$ au. Comparison with the prediscovery photometry by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) suggested that 3I started producing constant dust outflow probably around $r_\mathrm{h}\sim9$ au, coinciding with the turn-on distance of CO$_2$ ice. We also conduct a deep search of 3I/ATLAS with multiple nights of data taken in 2024 when the comet was at $r_\mathrm{h}=13$-$17$ au and conclude that the comet was no brighter than 2-5 magnitudes above the coma or bare-nucleus lightcurves. This suggests that the comet did not exhibit strong outbursts during these periods, consistent with 2I/Borisov as well as most long-period Solar System comets.</description>

Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>QZO: A Catalog of 5 Million Quasars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine different surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Based on ZTF g-band and WISE observations, we find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs with confidence higher than 90%. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g &lt; n_\mathrm{obs} / 80 + 20.375$. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the Pan-STARRS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements, but the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.</description>

      <title>MAMMOTH-MOSFIRE: Environmental Effects on Galaxy Interstellar Medium at $z\sim2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MAMMOTH-MOSFIRE program is a deep Keck/MOSFIRE K-band spectroscopic follow-up of emission-line galaxies identified in the MAMMOTH-Grism HST/WFC3 G141 slitless spectroscopic survey, targeting the core regions of three most massive galaxy protoclusters at cosmic noon. To introduce this program, we present a comprehensive analysis of the $\rm [N\,II]\lambda$6584, $\rm [S\,II]\lambda\lambda$6717,6731, and $\rm [O\,I]\lambda$6300 BPT diagnostics for a unique sample of 43 protocluster member galaxies at $z\sim2$, investigating how the overdense environment influences their interstellar medium ionization conditions. We find that, similar to their field counterparts at $z\sim2$, protocluster galaxies exhibit a systematic offset in the $\rm [N\,II]$ BPT diagram relative to the local star-forming sequence, but no such offset in the $\rm [S\,II]$ BPT diagram. Notably, we detect significantly elevated $\rm [O\,I]$/$\rm H \alpha$ ratios, which can be well reproduced by photoionization models incorporating both $\rm H II$ regions and low-velocity shocks ($v$ $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$). We caution that neglecting shock excitation can bias abundance measurements, leading to an overestimation of nitrogen enrichment. This provides a potential explanation for the long-standing puzzle of enhanced $\rm [N\,II]$/$\rm H \alpha$ ratios observed in $z\sim2$ galaxies. We further suggest that these shocks are likely environmentally driven, e.g., by ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions, which requires future confirmation through direct observations of features such as stripped gas tails.</description>

      <title>RIOJA. JWST and ALMA unveil the inhomogeneous and complex ISM structure in a star-forming galaxy at $z=6.81$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a complex, density-stratified interstellar medium (ISM) in the star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at $z = 6.81$, revealed by the unprecedented synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations detect key emission lines, including \oii~$\lambda\lambda$~3727, 3730, \oiii~4364, \oiii~$\lambda\lambda$~4960, 5008, \oiii\ 88 \micron, as well as H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates ISM properties that are typical for galaxies at $z\sim7$. These include low dust extinction ($A_{\rm V} \approx 0.14$ mag), moderate electron density ($n_{\rm e} \approx 500$~cm$^{-3}$), and low gas-phase metallicity ($\sim10\%$). However, the strong far-infrared \oiii\ 88 \micron\ emission detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-component ionized medium with uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-component ISM model, comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components ($T_e \approx 26,000$\,K; $n_e \approx 600~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and an extended, cooler, lower-density component ($T_e \approx 8,000$\,K; $n_e \approx 50~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of \oiii~88~\micron/\oiii~5008~\AA\ and \oiii~4364/\oiii~5008~\AA, with a volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two components. Our results demonstrate that JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Roles of SN and AGN Feedback in Shaping the Baryonic Content in a Wide Range of Dark Matter Halo Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon FEGA25 (Contini et al 2025), a previously introduced semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution, focusing on its enhanced treatment of supernova and active galactic nucleus feedback mechanisms. In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative (suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation), we introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas beyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a longstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the overestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25 is calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR, YS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions across a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas ejection in halos with logM_{halo} &lt; approximately 12, while AGN feedback becomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model, which activates primarily at late times, redshift &lt; 1, reproduces a characteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift zero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. Conversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution. Both models preserve the stellar and cold gas components and successfully reproduce the stellar to halo mass relation up to redshift 3. Our results emphasize that a physically motivated AGN driven mechanism capable of selectively removing hot gas is essential to accurately model the baryon cycle, particularly in intermediate halo mass regimes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{infall} \gtrsim 0.01 - 0.1 M_\odot yr^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \sim 20 - 10$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q \sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH-DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining select high-$z$ sources such as the Little Red Dots (LRDs), and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin-bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Threads: Interlinking the Stellar Initial Mass Function from Star-Birth to Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Toward the fabric of the Milky Way I. The density of disk streams from a local $250^3$ pc$^3$ volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using Gaia Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms SigMA and Uncover, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\approx 820$ objects / kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| &lt; 100$ pc), or surface densities of $\approx 160$ objects / kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5 km s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering The Bailey Diagrams of ab-type RR Lyrae Stars, Metallicity-Mediated Evolution as the Direct Cause of the Oosterhoff Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the Bailey diagrams of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars from the perspective of horizontal branch (HB) evolution, identifying evolutionary effects as the probable direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. By establishing empirical relationships between pulsation amplitude and average effective temperature, and utilizing pulsation period relations from nonlinear models, we transform theoretical HB evolutionary parameters into pulsation space and map them onto Bailey diagrams. We find that all pulsating Zero-Age Horizontal Branch stars fall within the Oosterhoff type I (OoI) region, with a pronounced period shift effect observed for relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] &gt; -1). Evolutionary tracks confirm that OoI stars are predominantly early-stage HB stars, while Oosterhoff type II stars are highly evolved objects entering the instability strip late in their HB phase from the blue side. Crucially, metallicity plays a dual role: it directly influences pulsation periods through the period relation, but more fundamentally acts as the first parameter influencing HB morphology. This morphology statistically determines whether HB stars predominantly enter the instability strip during early or late evolutionary stages. Consequently, while evolutionary effects directly govern an individual star's position in the Bailey diagram, the population-level Oosterhoff phenomenon emerges from the interplay between these effects and the metallicity-dependent HB morphology. Our study confirms that evolutionary effects are the direct drivers of the period difference and underscores metallicity's vital role in the statistical emergence of Oosterhoff groups. Continued study of this phenomenon offers key insights into the formation history of the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes in an external geometry of the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity by investigating its response to linear perturbations, including gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. To analyze the stability of the JMN-1 naked singularity under axial perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. The quasinormal mode frequencies provides information about the stability of spacetime, with the real part of the frequency determining the oscillation rate and the imaginary part governing the decay or growth of perturbations. Our results indicate that by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, we find that the background spacetime of JMN-1 naked singularity remains dynamically stable under axial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Tidal Suppression of Fuzzy Dark Matter Heating in Milky Way Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many previous studies have imposed stringent constraints on the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by analyzing observations of Galactic satellite galaxies, which show no significant evidence of the heating effect predicted by FDM. However, these analyses have generally neglected the tidal influence of the Milky Way, which can substantially suppress the FDM-induced heating effect in satellites. This oversight arises from computational challenges of accurately capturing the tidal effects in FDM simulations. In this study, we present a novel simulation framework that, for the first time, enables the simulation of an FDM-stellar system within an observationally motivated gravitational potential of the Milky Way. This framework incorporates the diverse Galactic components, including the gravitational influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using the Fornax dwarf galaxy as a case study, we demonstrate that tidal effects significantly alleviate the tension between observational data and the predicted heating effect for an FDM particle mass of $m_a\sim 10^{-22}$ eV.</description>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System, and only the second to display a clear coma. Infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity to measure its coma composition and determine the primary activity drivers. We report the first results from our JWST NIRSpec campaign for 3I/ATLAS, at an inbound heliocentric distance of $r_H=3.32$ au. The spectral images (spanning 0.6-5.3 $\mu$m) reveal a CO2 dominated coma, with enhanced outgassing in the sunward direction, and the presence of H2O, CO, OCS, water ice and dust. The coma CO2/H2O mixing ratio of $7.6\pm0.3$ is among the highest ever observed in a comet, and is 4.5-sigma above the trend as a function of heliocentric distance for long-period and Jupiter-family comets (excluding the outlier C/2016 R2). Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk. A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus, which could suppress the H2O sublimation rate relative to CO2 and CO.</description>
