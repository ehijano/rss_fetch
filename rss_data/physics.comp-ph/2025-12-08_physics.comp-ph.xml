      <title>A Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Algorithm for Particle Kinetics on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel, conservative discontinuous Galerkin algorithm is presented for particle kinetics on manifolds. The motion of particles on the manifold is represented using using both canonical and non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations. Our schemes apply to either formulations, but the canonical formulation results in a particularly efficient scheme that also conserves particle density and energy exactly. The collisionless update is coupled to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator that provides a simplified model for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium. An iterative scheme is constructed to ensure collisional invariants (density, momentum and energy) are preserved numerically. Rotation of the manifold is incorporated by modifying the Hamiltonian while ensuring a canonical formulation. Several test problems, including a kinetic version of the classical Sod-shock problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surfaces of a sphere and a paraboloid, with and without rotations, is presented. A prospectus for further development of this approach to simulation of kinetic theory in general relativity is presented.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis-Based Particle Detection for Accurate Nanoparticle Counting and Digital Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital assays represent a shift from traditional diagnostics and enable the precise detection of low-abundance analytes, critical for early disease diagnosis and personalized medicine, through discrete counting of biomolecular reporters. Within this paradigm, we present a particle counting algorithm for nanoparticle based imaging assays, formulated as a multiple-hypothesis statistical test under an explicit image-formation model and evaluated using a penalized likelihood rule. In contrast to thresholding or machine learning methods, this approach requires no training data or empirical parameter tuning, and its outputs remain interpretable through direct links to imaging physics and statistical decision theory.
  Through numerical simulations we demonstrate robust count accuracy across weak signals, variable backgrounds, magnification changes and moderate PSF mismatch. Particle resolvability tests further reveal characteristic error modes, including under-counting at very small separations and localized over-counting near the resolution limit. Practically, we also confirm the algorithm's utility, through application to experimental dark-field images comprising a nanoparticle-based assay for detection of DNA biomarkers derived from SARS-CoV-2. Statistically significant differences in particle count distributions are observed between control and positive samples. Full count statistics obtained further exhibit consistent over-dispersion, and provide insight into non-specific and target-induced particle aggregation. These results establish our method as a reliable framework for nanoparticle-based detection assays in digital molecular diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Adam: Disentangling Optimizer Effects in the Fine-Tuning of Atomistic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic foundation models constitute a paradigm shift in computational materials science by providing universal machine-learned interatomic potentials with broad transferability across chemical spaces. Although fine-tuning is essential for adapting these pretrained models to specific target systems, the influence of the optimization algorithm on this process remains insufficiently characterized. In this work, we perform a rigorous benchmark of seven first-order optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, SGD, LAMB, Ranger, and ScheduleFree, for the fine-tuning of foundation models across molecular, crystalline, and liquid regimes. We evaluate these algorithms based on energy and force accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution configurations, as well as their impact on downstream physical properties such as elastic moduli, phonon spectra, and interfacial dynamics. We interpret these empirical results through a preconditioning framework that views each optimizer as a data-dependent linear transformation of the gradient. This analysis clarifies how different update rules impose specific spectral filters on the effective loss Hessian. Across all regimes, AdamW and ScheduleFree achieve superior curvature conditioning and force accuracy, whereas stochastic gradient descent exhibits slow convergence and instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a brief second-order refinement stage reduces residual anisotropy in the loss landscape and enhances the fidelity of physical observables without increasing inference costs. These findings provide conceptual insight and practical guidance for selecting and designing optimizers to ensure the stable and efficient fine-tuning of universal interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Nonlinear Optimization Perspective on the Spin Glass Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuous nonlinear optimization model for the Spin Glass Problem (SGP), building on a classical result by Rosenberg (1972), which shows that for a class of multilinear polynomial problems the optimal values of the continuous relaxation and the corresponding discrete model coincide. Using the SGP as a case study, we provide a simple, problem-specific argument showing how any optimal solution returned by a continuous solver can be converted into an optimal discrete spin configuration, even when the solver outputs non-integer values. The relaxed model remains nonconvex and does not alter the inherent computational hardness of the problem, but it offers a direct and conceptually transparent continuous formulation that can be handled by modern global optimization software. Computational experiments on standard benchmark instances indicate that this approach can match, and in several cases surpass, recent integer programming linearization techniques, making it a practical and complementary tool for researchers working at the interface between statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Gravitational aggregation regimes: critical dissipation threshold, optimal rigidity and fractal transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a three-dimensional Discrete Element Method study of self-gravitation and contact mechanics in cold granular assemblies. The model couples direct Newtonian attraction between every particle pair with a linear visco-elastic normal contact law. Particles are treated as non-cohesive spheres; the normal force is parameterized to reproduce a prescribed restitution coefficient. Rotations are integrated using quaternions to avoid singularities. By normalizing the stiffness kn by kstar = G*m^2/R^3 and time by the free-fall time t_ff, I perform systematic parameter campaigns over dissipation (gamma) and normalized stiffness ktilde = kn/kstar. Results reveal three aggregation regimes. For low gamma the particles remain largely dispersive; above a critical gamma of about 5e2 aggregation accelerates until plateaus are reached in the aggregation time T_agg divided by t_ff. For stiffness ktilde on the order of 1e6 the aggregation time reaches a clear minimum. The cluster fraction C/Ntot shows a non-monotonic dependence on ktilde, with optimal cohesion at intermediate rigidity and peripheral isolation at extreme stiffness. Mapping the fractal dimension F across (gamma, ktilde) demonstrates transitions from compact structures (F about 3) to ramified structures (F below 2). These findings quantify how microscopic contact laws govern both the kinetics and microstructure of gravity-driven aggregation, providing a predictive framework for planetesimal formation and for calibrating DEM models against laboratory and micro-gravity experiments.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Stability of 2D Ti2COx MXenes Under Compression Using Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compressive and post-buckling behavior of Ti2C and Ti2CO2 MXene nanosheets is studied using large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes. The presented findings stimulate future studies on MXene morphological transformations, such as the development of nanotube, nanoscroll, and folded architectures.</description>

      <title>Mapping vacancy and bonding electron distributions around aluminium nanovoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All materials have defects and many contain nanostructures, both of which disrupt chemical bonding - the basis of materials properties. No experimental measurements of bonding electron distributions associated with defects and nanostructures have ever been possible. We present a method enabling such measurements and interrogate nanovoids surrounded by vacancies - the most fundamental of nanostructures and defects - in aluminium. We measure the volume of a vacancy with 3% uncertainty and map vacancy concentrations surrounding nanovoids with nanometre resolution in three dimensions where previously only two-dimensional mapping was possible. We discover that radiation-damaged voids can "heal". Our bonding measurements are depth-resolved, vacancy-sensitive, and agree with density functional theory. This work opens bonding electron density measurements to inhomogeneous nanostructured multi-phased materials so that the electronic origins of phenomena such as strengthening, weakening, interface functionality, solute diffusion and phase transformations within them may be revealed.</description>

      <title>FieldSeer I: Physics-Guided World Models for Long-Horizon Electromagnetic Dynamics under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FieldSeer I, a geometry-aware world model that forecasts electromagnetic field dynamics from partial observations in 2-D TE waveguides. The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80-&gt;Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240-&gt;Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180-&gt;Q=100). Crucially, it enables edit-after-prefix geometry modifications without re-assimilation. Results demonstrate that geometry-conditioned world models provide a practical path toward interactive digital twins for photonic design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deepens into the analysis of the protein secondary structure using Frenet frame to describe the curvature and torsion of the discrete curve formed by the protein $\alpha$-carbons. We show how a simple criterion based on the evaluation of the curvature and torsion of the discrete curve can be useful to pinpoint the presence of some secondary and supersecondary structures in proteins. Moreover, the description of proteins as fixed points of an effective action inspired by an $U(1)$ gauge model is strongly supported by the curvature and torsion observed over a large dataset of proteins in the Protein Data Bank.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and moir\'e Proximity Effects in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 Trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating magnetic order to moir\'e superlattices is of significant scientific and technological interest. Based on first-principles calculations, we study the interplay of magnetic proximity and moir\'e proximity in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 trilayers with different stackings and twist angles. Large valley splitting is observed due to redistribution of the exciton charge density across layers via a super-exchange-like mechanism, and its electric-field dependence bears similarity to electrically tunable and valley-selective Feshbach resonances. The valley splitting can be magnified in moir\'e superlattices owing to the superposition of Umklapp excitons folded from moir\'e minibands, yielding spatially modulated and enhanced magnetic proximity. The moir\'e proximity effect is demonstrated via an imprinted moir\'e potential on CrI3 layer and its feedback to the direct moir\'e potential on WSe2 bilayers is observed. The cooperation between the direct and imprinted moir\'e potentials is shown to yield novel topological and correlated states.</description>

      <title>Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Riemannian Optimization Methods for Ground States of Rotating Multicomponent Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyze Riemannian optimization methods for computing ground states of rotating multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates, defined as minimizers of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional. To resolve the non-uniqueness of ground states induced by phase invariance, we work on a quotient manifold endowed with a general Riemannian metric. By introducing an auxiliary phase-aligned iteration and employing fixed-point convergence theory, we establish a unified local convergence framework for Riemannian gradient descent methods and derive explicit convergence rates. Specializing this framework to two metrics tailored to the energy landscape, we study the energy-adaptive and Lagrangian-based Riemannian gradient descent methods. While monotone energy decay and global convergence are established only for the former, a quantified local convergence analysis is provided for both methods. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that the Lagrangian-based method, which incorporates second-order information on the energy functional and mass constraints, achieves faster local convergence than the energy-adaptive scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory Through the Lens of Multilevel Monte Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) has exhibited advantages over the standard Kohn-Sham DFT method and has become an attractive approach for large-scale electronic structure calculations. The sDFT method avoids the expensive matrix diagonalization by introducing a set of random orbitals and approximating the density matrix via Chebyshev expansion of a matrix-valued function. In this work, we study the sDFT with a plane-wave discretization, and discuss variance reduction algorithms in the framework of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In particular, we show that the density matrix evaluation in sDFT can be decomposed into many levels by increasing the plane-wave cutoffs or the Chebyshev polynomial orders. This decomposition renders the computational cost independent of the discretization size or temperature. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, we provide rigorous analysis of the statistical errors and present numerical experiments on some material systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs), a novel framework for solving time-dependent partial differential equations with high accuracy and capable of handling high-dimensional problems. Our architecture incorporates tensor neural networks and evolutionary parametric approximation. A posterior error bounded is proposed to support the extrapolation capabilities. In the numerical implementations, we adopt a partial update strategy to achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining precision and robustness. Notably, as a low-rank approximation method of complex dynamical systems, pETNNs enhance the accuracy of evolutionary deep neural networks and empower computational abilities to address high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the pETNNs in solving time-dependent complex equations, including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, high-dimensional heat equations, high-dimensional transport equations, and dispersive equations of higher-order derivatives.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</description>
