      <title>Morphodynamics of melting ice over turbulent warm water streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the morphodynamics of an ice layer over a turbulent stream of warm water using numerical simulations. At low water speeds, characteristic streamwise undulations appear, which can be explained by the Reynolds analogy between heat and momentum transfer. As the water speed increases, these undulations combine with spanwise ripples of a much greater length scale. These ripples are generated by a melting mechanism controlled by the instability originating from the ice-water interactions, and, through a melting/freezing process, they evolve downstream with a migration velocity much slower than the turbulence characteristic velocity.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are an introduction to fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) and the formulation of numerical schemes for the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). Fluctuating hydrodynamics was originally introduced by Landau and Lifshitz as a way to put thermal fluctuations into a continuum framework by including a stochastic forcing to each dissipative transport process (e.g., heat flux). While FHD has been useful in modeling transport and fluid dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, theoretical calculations have been feasible only with simplifying assumptions. As such there is great interest in numerical schemes for Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (CFHD). There are a variety of algorithms (e.g., spectral, finite element, lattice Boltzmann) but in this introduction we focus on finite volume schemes. Accompanying these notes is a demonstration program in Python available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coupled heat and fluid transport in pulled extrusion of cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fabrication of optical fibres, the viscosity of the glass varies dramatically with temperature so that heat transfer plays an important role in the deformation of the fibre geometry. Surprisingly, for quasi-steady drawing, with measurement of pulling tension, the applied heat can be adjusted to control the tension and temperature modelling is not needed. However, when pulling tension is not measured, a coupled heat and fluid flow model is needed to determine the inputs required for a desired output. In the fast process of drawing a preform to a fibre, heat advection dominates conduction so that heat conduction may be neglected. By contrast, in the slow process of extruding a preform, heat conduction is important. This means that solving the coupled flow and temperature modelling is essential for prediction of preform geometry. In this paper we derive such a model that incorporates heat conduction for the extensional flow of fibres. The dramatic variations in viscosity with temperature means that this problem is extremely challenging to solve via standard numerical techniques and we therefore develop a novel finite-difference numerical solution method that proves to be highly robust. We use this method to show that conduction significantly affects the size of internal holes at the exit of the device.</description>

      <title>Full rotational dynamics of plastic microfibers in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion, settling, and dispersion of microplastics in the ocean are determined by their rotational dynamics. We present experiments on elongated, large aspect ratio, and mildly curved plastic fibers slightly longer than the Kolmogorov length scale. Exploiting their uniquely identifiable three dimensional orientation, we perform original optical Lagrangian investigations and provide a set of homogeneous data on their rotation rates around their longitudinal axis -- spinning rate -- and transversal axes -- tumbling rates -- which we explain in the context of the general features of turbulence.</description>

      <title>A hybrid reduced-order model for segregated fluid-structure interaction solvers in an ALE approach at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a first step for constructing a hybrid reduced-order models (ROMs) for segregated fluid-structure interaction in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach at a high Reynolds number using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The ROM is driven by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with hybrid techniques that combines the classical Galerkin projection and two data-driven methods (radial basis networks , and neural networks/ long short term memory). Results demonstrate the ROM ability to accurately capture the physics of fluid-structure interaction phenomena. This approach is validated through a case study focusing on flow-induced vibration (FIV) of a pitch-plunge airfoil at a high Reynolds number 10000000.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Relative Equilibria in Planar $N$-Vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for nonlinear stability of relative equilibria in the planar $N$-vortex problem. This result builds on our previous work on the Hamiltonian formulation of its relative dynamics as a Lie--Poisson system. The relative dynamics recasts the stability of relative equilibria of the $N$-vortex problem as that of the corresponding fixed points in the relative dynamics. We analyze the stability of such fixed points by exploiting the Hamiltonian formulation as well as invariants and constraints that naturally arise in the relative dynamics. The stability condition is essentially an Energy--Casimir method, except that we also incorporate the constraints in an effective manner. We apply the method to two types of relative equilibria: (i) three identical vortices at the vertices of an equilateral triangle along with another one at its center and (ii) four identical vortices at the vertices of a square with another one its center, where the circulation of the vortex at the center is arbitrary in both cases. We show that they are stable/unstable depending on the circulation of the vortex at the center.</description>

Abstract: In order to study the penetration characteristics in areas with different water content and different stress distributions in the radial direction of the hole after hydraulicization measures, an improved LFTD1812 triaxial permeability meter was used to conduct a test to measure the polar permeability characteristics of coal with different water content combinations were measured by permeability instrument, and the porosity, permeability, pressure gradient and seepage velocity of different samples were analyzed. The relationship between sample porosity, permeability, pressure gradient and seepage velocity was discussed, the influence of moisture content on permeability was discussed, and the directionality and the directivity and polarization effect of permeability were found.. Result shows that The relationship between permeability and porosity shows two trends of exponential type and logarithmic type, and the porosity-permeability({\phi}-k) plane is divided into three influence regions: super index (I), index (II) and logarithm (III).</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh-B\'enard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh--B\'enard problem using a numerical technique called deflated continuation. Our aim is to study the influence of the magnetic field on the bifurcation diagram as the Chandrasekhar number $Q$ increases and compare it to the standard (non-magnetic) Rayleigh--B\'enard problem. We compute steady states at a high Chandrasekhar number of $Q=10^3$ over a range of the Rayleigh number $0\leq \Ra\leq 10^5$. These solutions are obtained by combining deflation with a continuation of steady states at low Chandrasekhar number, which allows us to explore the influence of the strength of the magnetic field as $Q$ increases from low coupling, where the magnetic effect is almost negligible, to strong coupling at $Q=10^3$. We discover a large profusion of states with rich dynamics and observe a complex bifurcation structure with several pitchfork, Hopf, and saddle-node bifurcations. Our numerical simulations show that the onset of bifurcations in the problem is delayed when $Q$ increases, while solutions with fluid velocity patterns aligning with the background vertical magnetic field are privileged. Additionally, we report a branch of states that stabilizes at high magnetic coupling, suggesting that one may take advantage of the magnetic field to discriminate solutions.</description>

      <title>Equations for small amplitude shallow water waves over small bathymetric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized version of the $abcd$-Boussinesq class of systems is derived to accommodate variable bottom topography in two-dimensional space. This extension allows for the conservation of suitable energy functionals in some cases and enables the description of water waves in closed basins with well-justified slip-wall boundary conditions. The derived systems possess a form that ensures their solutions adhere to important principles of physics and mathematics. By demonstrating their consistency with the Euler equations and estimating their approximation error, we establish the validity of these new systems. Their derivation is based on the assumption of small bathymetric variations. With practical applications in mind, we assess the effectiveness of some of these new systems through comparisons with standard benchmarks. The results indicate that the assumptions made during the derivation are not overly restrictive. The applications of the new systems encompass a wide range of scenarios, including the study of tsunamis, tidal waves, and waves in ports and lakes.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of long waves through regions of irregular floating ice and bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing theoretical results for attenuation of surface waves propagating on water of random fluctuating depth are shown to over predict the rate of decay due to the way in which ensemble averaging is performed. A revised approach is presented which corrects this and is shown to conserve energy. New theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results which use averaging of simulations of wave scattering over finite sections of random bathymetry for which transfer matrix eigenvalues are used to accurately measure decay. The model of wave propagation used in this paper is derived from a linearised long wavelength assumption whereby depth averaging leads to time harmonic waves being represented as solutions to a simple ordinary differential equation. In this paper it is shown how this can be adapted to incorporate a model of a continuous covering of the surface by fragmented floating ice. Attenuation of waves through broken ice of random thickness is then analysed in a similar manner as bed variations previously and some comparisons are made with published field data for attenuation of waves in the marginal ice zones. Key features of the data are reproduced by theory including the attenuation being proportional to a power of frequency between 2 and 4 as well as capturing the "roll-over effect" at high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Weakening the effect of boundaries: `diffusion-free' boundary conditions as a `do least harm' alternative to Neumann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss a poorly known alternative boundary condition to the usual Neumann or `stress-free' boundary condition typically used to weaken boundary layers when diffusion is present but very small. These `diffusion-free' boundary conditions were first developed (as far as the authors know) in 1995 (Sureshkumar &amp; Beris, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., vol 60, 53-80, 1995) in viscoelastic flow modelling but are worthy of general consideration in other research areas. To illustrate their use, we solve two simple ODE problems and then treat a PDE problem - the inertial wave eigenvalue problem in a rotating cylinder, sphere and spherical shell for small but non-zero Ekman number $E$. Where inviscid inertial waves exist (cylinder and sphere), the viscous flows in the Ekman boundary layer are $O(E^{1/2})$ weaker than for the corresponding stress-free layer and fully $O(E)$ weaker than in a non-slip layer. These diffusion-free boundary conditions can also be used with hyperdiffusion and provide a systematic way to generate as many further boundary conditions as required. The weakening effect of this boundary condition could allow precious numerical resources to focus on other areas of the flow and thereby make smaller, more realistic values of diffusion accessible to simulations.</description>

      <title>DiuSST: A conceptual model of diurnal warm layers for idealized atmospheric simulations with interactive SST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diurnal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) may play an important role for cloud organization above the tropical ocean, with implications for precipitation extremes, storminess, and climate sensitivity. Recent cloud-resolving simulations demonstrate how imposed diurnal SST oscillations can strongly, and delicately, impact mesoscale convective organization. In spite of this nuanced interaction, many idealized modeling studies of tropical convection either assume a constant, homogeneous SST or, in case of a responsive sea surface, represent the upper ocean by a slab with fixed thickness. Here we show that slab ocean models with constant heat capacity fail to capture the wind-dependence of observed diurnal sea surface warming. To alleviate this shortcoming, we present a simple, yet explicitly depth-resolved model of upper-ocean temperature dynamics under atmospheric forcing. Our modular scheme describes turbulent mixing as diffusion with a wind-dependent diffusivity, in addition to a bulk mixing term and heat fluxes entering as sources and sinks. Using observational data, we apply Bayesian inference to calibrate the model. In contrast with a slab model, our model captures the exponential reduction of the diurnal warming amplitude with increasing wind speed. Further, our model performs comparably to a more elaborately parameterized diurnal warm layer model. Formulated as a single partial differential equation with three key tuning parameters, the model is suitable as an interactive numerical boundary condition for idealized atmospheric simulations.</description>

      <title>Rheological Analysis and Evaluation of Measurement Techniques for the Curing Polymethylmethacrylate Bone Cement in Vertebroplasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat vertebral fractures, which conventionally involves injecting polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement into the fractured vertebra. A common risk associated with vertebroplasty is cement leaking out of the vertebra during the injection, which may occur due to a lack of understanding of the bone cement's complex flow behavior. Therefore, experiments to quantify the cement's flow properties are necessary for understanding and proper handling of the bone cement. In this study, we aimed to characterize the behavior of the PMMA bone cement in its curing stages to obtain parameters that govern the flow behavior during the injection. We used rotational and oscillatory rheometry for our measurements, as well as a custom-made injector setup that replicated a typical vertebroplasty setting. Our results showed that the complex viscoelastic behavior of the bone cement is significantly affected by deformations and temperature. We found that the results from rotational tests, often used for characterizing the bone cement, are susceptible to measurement artifacts caused by wall slip and "ridge"-like formations in the test sample. We also found the Cox-Merz rule to be conditionally valid, which affects the use of oscillatory tests to obtain shear-thinning characteristics for the bone cement. Our findings identify important differences in the measured flow behavior of PMMA bone cement when assessed by different rheological methods, understanding which is crucial for its risk-free usage in downstream medical applications.</description>
