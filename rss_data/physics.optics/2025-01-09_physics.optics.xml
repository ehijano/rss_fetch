      <title>Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Optical Routing in Multi-port Magneto-Optical Devices on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optical devices are key components in photonic integrated circuits for light reflection blocking and routing. Most reported silicon integrated nonreciprocal optical devices to date were unit devices. To allow complex signal routing between multi-ports in photonic networks, multi-port magneto-optical (MO) nonreciprocal photonic devices are desired. In this study, we report experimental demonstration of a silicon integrated 5*5 multiport nonreciprocal photonic device based on magneto-optical waveguides. By introducing different nonreciprocal phase shift effect to planar photonic waveguides, the device focuses light to different ports for both forward and backward propagation. The device shows designable nonreciprocal transmission between 5*5 ports, achieving 16 dB isolation ratio and -18 dB crosstalk.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic Kerr effect in LaAlO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the terahertz (THz) electro-optic Kerr effect (KE) dynamics in LaAlO3 (LAO), a widely used substrate for thin film preparation. We show that the KE dynamics strongly depend on the material anisotropy due to interference between THz field-induced and strain-induced optical birefringence. Such interference leads to quasi-phase matching conditions of the KE, which becomes strongly frequency dependent. Depending on the THz frequency, the KE exhibits a uni- and bipolar shape of the quadratic response. The demonstrated effects will be present in a wide variety of materials used as substrates in different THz-pump laser-probe experiments and need to be considered in order to disentangle the different contributions to the measured ultrafast dynamic signals.</description>

      <title>"Exact" solutions for circularly polarized Kerr solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the nonlinear vector curl-curl equation describing a monochromatic light wave in a Kerr medium, an exact reduction is suggested which results in a system of four ordinary differential equations, of the first order each, for functions of the transverse radial coordinate. Numerical solutions of this system, with appropriate boundary conditions, give full information about internal structure of a strongly nonlinear, stationary optical beam consisting mainly of a definite circular polarization, but with a small portion of the opposite polarization containing a double vortex, as well as with the parallel component of the electric field containing an ordinary vortex.</description>

      <title>Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</description>

      <title>Optical resonators constitute a universal spin simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, the universal homogeneous spin simularor (UHSS) using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry based on the one introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024), arXiv:2306.0574(3) ]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size. This approach works because it allows arbitrary long-range interactions in the spin model to be mapped on an optical system with only nearest-neighbor physical interactions.</description>

      <title>Approximations of MINFLUX Localization Precision with Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technology that measures the position of single fluorophores with nanometer precision using fewer photons than any other fluorescence imaging or tracking technique. Here, we derive simple and instructive analytical equations for MINFLUX localization precision with a special focus on background photons. A fluorescence background, either arising from an imperfect zero of the MINFLUX excitation point spread function (PSF) or from auto- or out-of-focus fluorescence, ultimately limits the resolution achievable with MINFLUX. Building on previous work, we try to improve our understanding of the influence of background, especially when it is unknown, through a new set of expressions for the localization precision, based on an explicit background term instead of signal-to-background ratio. We use these equations to generate an intuitive understanding of how fluorescence background affects MINFLUX measurements and illustrate that:
  - The precision of an emitter position estimate depends on the gradient of its excitation profile.
  - Knowledge of the fluorescence background, obtained during post-processing of MINFLUX traces or through separate measurements, provides a better localization precision than in the case of unknown background.
  - In diffraction-limited systems, localization with a PSF that features a near-zero minimum outperforms localization with a maximum.
  We also present an analytical expression for the localization precision in orbital tracking, which we use for comparison to MINFLUX.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Multipole Theory for Two-dimensional Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) theory for calculating the multipole decomposition in two-dimensional (2-D) structures consisting of isolated, arbitrarily shaped, inhomogeneous, anisotropic cylinders or a collection of such. To derive the multipole decomposition, we first solve the scattering problem by expanding the scattered electric field in divergenceless cylindrical vector wave functions (CVWF) with unknown expansion coefficients that characterize the multipole response. These expansion coefficients are then expressed via contour integrals of the vectorial components of the scattered electric field evaluated via an electric field volume integral equation (EFVIE). The kernels of the EFVIE are the products of the tensorial 2-D Green's function (GF) expansion and the equivalent 2-D volumetric electric and magnetic current densities. We validate the theory using the commercial finite element solver COMSOL Multiphysics. In the validation, we compute the multipole decomposition of the fields scattered from various 2-D structures and compare the results with alternative formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the theory to study an emerging photonics application on oligomers-based highly directional switching using active media. This analysis addresses a critical gap in current literature, where multipole theories exist primarily for three-dimensional (3-D) particles of isotropic materials. Our work enhances the understanding and utilization of the optical properties of 2-D, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic cylindrical structures, contributing to advancements in photonic and meta-optics technologies.</description>

      <title>Tutorial of Fourier transform for ultrafast optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial is designed for individuals who are new to the field of ultrafast optics. It was written in response to the apparent lack of comprehensive introductions to the basic Fourier transform, extending beyond the flat-phase description. Additionally, there is a need for complete derivations of several relations involving the Fourier transform, maintaining its most general formulation. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of Fourier-transform constants and ensures a complete understanding. It shows the importance of having Fourier-transform constants as parameters, which I would like to advocate people to do. Most important of all, I have seen misuse of Fourier transform over my years of discussion in the lab and from others' questions since I shared my code publicly on Github. Surprisingly, since people check the correctness of numerical implementation only by seeing if the simulation result is smooth and if it duplicates the "overall physics," this seems to be a widespread problem from my perspective, which can be solved by a simple tutorial. This is why I hope that this tutorial can help people understand more about the Fourier transform, especially in the context of ultrafast optics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optics using intense optical coherent state superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superpositions of coherent light states, are vital for quantum technologies. However, restrictions in existing state preparation and characterization schemes, in combination with decoherence effects, prevent their intensity enhancement and implementation in nonlinear optics. Here, by developing a decoherence--free approach, we generate intense femtosecond--duration infrared coherent state superpositions (CSS) with a mean photon number orders of magnitude higher than the existing CSS sources. We utilize them in nonlinear optics to drive the second harmonic generation process in an optical crystal. We experimentally and theoretically show that the non--classical nature of the intense infrared CSS is imprinted in the second-order autocorrelation traces. Additionally, theoretical analysis shows that the quantum features of the infrared CSS are also present in the generated second harmonic. The findings introduce the optical CSS into the realm of nonlinear quantum optics, opening up new paths in quantum information science and quantum light engineering by creating non-classical light states in various spectral regions via non-linear up-conversion processes.</description>

      <title>Broadband ptychographic imaging for biological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ptychography is an attractive advance of coherent diffraction imaging (CDI), which can provide high lateral resolution and wide field of view. The theoretical resolution of ptychography is dose-limited, therefore making ptychography workable with a broadband source will be highly beneficial. However, broad spectra of light source conflict with the high coherence assumption in CDI that the current reconstruction algorithm were built upon. In this paper, we demonstrated that incorporation of a blind deconvolution in the reconstruction algorithm can improve the image quality of ptychography with broadband source. This broadband reconstruction algorithm can obtain high-quality amplitude and phase images of complex-valued samples requiring no knowledge of the illumination spectrum. Optical experiments using biological samples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The significant improvement in low coherence tolerance by our approach can pave the way for implementing ultrafast imaging with femtosecond or attosecond lasers or high-flux ptychographic imaging with laboratory EUV or X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-Limited Quantum Lidar for Joint Range and Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum lidar protocol to jointly estimate the range and velocity of a target by illuminating it with a single beam of pulsed displaced squeezed light. In the lossless scenario, we show that the mean-squared errors of both range and velocity estimations are inversely proportional to the squared number of signal photons, simultaneously attaining the Heisenberg limit. This is achieved by engineering the multi-photon squeezed state of the temporal modes and adopting standard homodyne detection. To assess the robustness of the quantum protocol, we incorporate photon losses and detuning of the homodyne receiver. Our findings reveal a quantum advantage over the best-known classical strategy across a wide range of round-trip transmissivities. Particularly, the quantum advantage is substantial for sufficiently small losses, even when compared to the optimal -- potentially unattainable -- classical performance limit. The quantum advantage also extends to the practical case where quantum engineering is done on top of a strong classical coherent state with watts of power. This, together with the robustness against losses and the feasibility of the measurement with state-of-the-art technology, make the protocol highly promising for near-term implementation.</description>
