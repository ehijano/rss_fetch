      <title>Extensive Pollution of Uranus and Neptune's Atmospheres by Upsweep of Icy Material During the Nice Model Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Nice model of solar system formation, Uranus and Neptune undergo an orbital upheaval, sweeping through a planetesimal disk. The region of the disk from which material is accreted by the ice giants during this phase of their evolution has not previously been identified. We perform direct N-body orbital simulations of the four giant planets to determine the amount and origin of solid accretion during this orbital upheaval. We find that the ice giants undergo an extreme bombardment event, with collision rates as much as ~3 per hour assuming km-sized planetesimals, increasing the total planet mass by up to ~0.35%. In all cases, the initially outermost ice giant experiences the largest total enhancement. We determine that for some plausible planetesimal properties, the resulting atmospheric enrichment could potentially produce sufficient latent heat to alter the planetary cooling timescale according to existing models. Our findings suggest that substantial accretion during this phase of planetary evolution may have been sufficient to impact the atmospheric composition and thermal evolution of the ice giants, motivating future work on the fate of deposited solid material.</description>

      <title>The metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b from Gemini-S/IGRINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4-2.4 $\mu$m with Gemini-S/IGRINS. We detected the presence of H$_{2}$O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise rations of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of $\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.70^{+1.27}_{-0.93}$, consistent with the stellar value, and a super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O$=0.80^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$. We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within $1\sigma$ but favored a slightly more sub-stellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio ($\left[\frac{\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}} {\mathrm{H}}\right]=-0.74^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and C/O$=0.59^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ($V_{sys}$) and Keplerian ($K_{p}$) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted $V_{sys}$ for H$_{2}$O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H$_{2}$O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.</description>

      <title>How planets form by pebble accretion V. Silicate rainout delays contraction of sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of Super-Earth-to-Neptune sized exoplanets relies heavily on our understanding of their formation and evolution. In this study, we link a model of planet formation by pebble accretion to the planets' long-term observational properties by calculating the interior evolution, starting from the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. We investigate the evolution of the interior structure in 5-20 Earth masses planets, accounting for silicate redistribution caused by convective mixing, rainout (condensation and settling), and mass loss. Specifically, we have followed the fate of the hot silicate vapor that remained in the planet's envelope after planet formation, as the planet cools. We find that disk dissipation is followed by a rapid contraction of the envelope within 10 Myr. Subsequent cooling leads to substantial growth of the planetary core through silicate rainout, accompanied by inflated radii, in comparison to the standard models of planets that formed with core-envelope structure. We examine the dependence of rainout on the planet's envelope mass, distance from its host star, its silicate mass, and the atmospheric opacity. We find that the population of planets formed with polluted envelopes can be roughly divided in three groups, based on the mass of their gas envelopes: bare rocky cores that have shed their envelopes, super-Earth planets with a core-envelope structure, and Neptune-like planets with diluted cores that undergo gradual rainout. For polluted planets formed with envelope masses below 0.4 Earth mass, we anticipate that the inflation of the planet's radius caused by rainout will enhance mass loss by a factor of 2-8 compared to planets with non-polluted envelopes. Our model provides an explanation for bridging the gap between the predicted composition gradients in massive planets and the core-envelope structure in smaller planets.</description>

      <title>The youngest of hot jupiters in action: episodic accretion outbursts in Gaia20eae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent imaging observations with ALMA and other telescopes found widespread signatures of planet presence in protoplanetary discs at tens of au separations from their host stars. Here we point out that the presence of very massive planets at 0.1 au sized orbits can be deduced for protostars accreting gas at very high rates, when their discs display powerful Thermal Instability bursts. Earlier work showed that a massive planet modifies the nature of this instability, with outbursts triggered at the outer edge of the deep gap opened by the planet. We present simulations of this effect, finding two types of TI outbursts: downstream and upstream of the planet, which may or may not be causally connected. We apply our model to the outburst in Gaia20eae. We find that the agreement between the data and our disc thermal instability model is improved if there is a planet of 6 Jupiter masses orbiting the star at 0.062 au separation. Gaia20eae thus becomes the second episodically erupting star, after FU Ori, where the presence of a massive planet is strongly suspected. Future observations of similar systems will constrain the mode and the frequency of planet formation in such an early epoch.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Halo Parameters from Overheated Exoplanets via Bayesian Hierarchical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) can become captured, deposit annihilation energy, and hence increase the heat flow in exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Detecting such a DM-induced heating in a population of exoplanets in the inner kpc of the Milky Way thus provides potential sensitivity to the galactic DM halo parameters. We develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to investigate the feasibility of DM discovery with exoplanets and examine future prospects to recover the spatial distribution of DM in the Milky Way. We reconstruct from mock exoplanet datasets observable parameters such as exoplanet age, temperature, mass, and location, together with DM halo parameters, for representative choices of measurement uncertainty and the number of exoplanets detected. We find that detection of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ exoplanets in the inner Galaxy can yield quantitative information on the galactic DM density profile, under the assumption of 10% measurement uncertainty. Even as few as $\mathcal{O}(10)$ exoplanets can deliver meaningful sensitivities if the DM density and inner slope are sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupling of Keplerian orbits in a hierarchical four-body system: from the Galactic Centre to compact planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the long-term evolution of two bodies in nearby initially coplanar orbits around a central dominant body perturbed by a fourth body on a distant Keplerian orbit. Our previous works that considered this setup enforced circular orbits by adding a spherical potential of extended mass, which dampens Kozai--Lidov oscillations; it led to two qualitatively different modes of the evolution of the nearby orbits. In one scenario, their mutual interaction exceeds the effect of differential precession caused by a perturbing body. This results in a long-term coherent evolution, with nearly coplanar orbits experiencing only small oscillations of inclination. We extend the previous work by (i) considering post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of the central body, either instead of or in addition to the potential of extended mass, (ii) relaxing the requirement of strictly circular orbits, and (iii) removing the strict requirement of complete Kozai--Lidov damping. Thus, we identify the modes of inter-orbital interaction described for the zero-eccentricity case in the more general situation, which allows for its applicability to a much broader range of astrophysical systems than considered initially. In this work, we scale the systems to the orbits of S-stars; we consider the clockwise disc to represent the perturbing body, with post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of Sagittarius A* playing the role of damping potential. Considering post-Newtonian corrections, even stellar-mass central bodies in compact planetary systems can allow for the coupled evolution of Keplerian orbits.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Solar Coronal Holes Using Computer Vision and LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of space exploration, coronal holes on the sun play a significant role due to their impact on satellites and aircraft through their open magnetic fields and increased solar wind emissions. This study employs computer vision techniques to detect coronal hole regions and estimate their sizes using imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Additionally, we utilize deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze trends in the area of coronal holes and predict their areas across various solar regions over a span of seven days. By examining time series data, we aim to identify patterns in coronal hole behavior and understand their potential effects on space weather. This research enhances our ability to anticipate and prepare for space weather events that could affect Earth's technological systems.</description>
