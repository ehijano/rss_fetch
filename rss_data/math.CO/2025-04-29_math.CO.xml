      <title>A Variant of Game of Sliding Coins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present a variant of the sliding coins game. Two coins are placed on distinct squares of a semi-infinite linear board with squares numbered $0, 1, 2, dots, $. Two players take turns and move a coin to a lower unoccupied square. When a coin is pushed to the outside of the linear board, the players cannot use this coin anymore. In this game, we have another operation of moving coins: moving the coin on the right leftward and pushing the coin on the left. This last operation complicates this game's mathematical structure, but we have managed to make formulas for Grundy numbers. Since all the positions of this game of two coins are the next player's winning position, this game of two coins is trivial as a game. However, by making the sum of two games, we get a meaningful game in which the player who plays for the last time is the winner. With these Grundy numbers formulae, we get the winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Choquet extension of non-monotone submodular setfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Choquet introduced an integral formula to extend a monotone increasing setfunction on a sigma-algebra to a (nonlinear) functional on bounded measurable functions. The most important special case is when the setfunction is submodular; then this functional is convex (and vice versa). In the finite case, an analogous extension was introduced by this author; this is a rather special case, but no monotonicity was assumed. In this note we show that Choquet's integral formula can be applied to all submodular setfunctions, and the resulting functional is still convex. We extend the construction to submodular setfunctions defined on a set-algebra (rather than a sigma-algebra). The main property of submodular setfunctions used in the proof is that they have bounded variation. As a generalization of the convexity of the extension, we show that (under smoothness conditions) a ``lopsided'' version of Fubini's Theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the number of envy-free divisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze lower bounds for the number of envy-free divisions, in the classical Woodall-Stormquist setting and in a non-classical case, when envy-freeness is combined with the equipartition of a measure.
  1. In the first scenario, there are $r$ hungry players, and the cake (that is, the segment $[0,1]$) is cut into $r$ pieces. Then there exist at least two different envy-free divisions. This bound is sharp: for each $r$, we present an example of preferences such that there are exactly two envy-free divisions.
  2. In the second (hybrid) scenario, there are $p$ not necessarily hungry players ($p$ is a prime) and a continuous measure $\mu$ on $[0,1]$. The cake is cut into $2p-1$ pieces, the pieces are allocated to $p$ boxes (with some restrictions) and the players choose the boxes. Then there exists at least $\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \cdot 2^{1-p}$ envy-free divisions such that the measure $\mu$ is equidistributed among the players.</description>

      <title>Color rules for cyclic wreath products and semigroup algebras from projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$.
  Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</description>

      <title>The dimension of sparse random graph orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random graph order is a partial order obtained from a random graph on $[n]$ by taking the transitive closure of the adjacency relation. The dimension of the random graph orders from random bipartite graphs $B(n,n,p)$ and from $G(n,p)$ were previously studied when $p=\Omega(\log n/n)$, and there is a conjectured phase transition in the sparse range $p=O(1/n)$. We investigate the dimensions of the partial orders arising from $B(n,n,p)$ and $G(n,p)$ in this sparse range. We also prove an upper bound on the dimension of general partial orders based on decompositions of partial orders into suborders, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>New Bounds for Induced Tur\'an Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Hunter, Milojevi\'c, Sudakov and Tomon consider the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph containing no copy of the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$ and no induced copy of a "pattern" graph $H$. They conjecture that, for $s \geq |V(H)|$, this "induced extremal number" differs by at most a constant factor from the standard extremal number of $H$. Towards this, we give bounds on the induced extremal number in terms of degeneracy, which establish some non-trivial relationship between the induced and standard extremal numbers in general. We also show that (as in the case of standard extremal numbers) the induced extremal number is dominated by that of the 2-core of a single connected component. Finally, we present some graphs arising from incidence geometry which may serve as counterexamples to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A classification of two-distance-transitive Cayley graphs over the generalized quaternion groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-complete graph is \emph{$2$-distance-transitive} if, for $i=1,2$ and for any two vertex pairs $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$ with the same distance $i$ in the graph, there exists an element of the graph automorphism group that maps $(u_1,v_1)$ to $(u_2,v_2)$. This is a generalization concept of the classical well-known distance-transitive graphs. In this paper, we completely determine the family of $2$-distance-transitive Cayley graphs over the generalized quaternion groups.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Split Comparability Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A split comparability graph is a split graph which is transitively orientable. In this work, we characterize split comparability graphs in terms of vertex labelling. Further, using this characterization, we prove that the permutation-representation number of a split comparability graph is at most three. This gives us an alternative proof of the result in order theory that the dimension of a split order is at most three.</description>

      <title>Expanding vertices to triangles in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contraction of triangles is a standard operation in the study of cubic graphs, as it reduces the order of the graph while typically preserving many of its properties. In this paper, we investigate the converse problem, wherein certain vertices of cubic graphs are expanded into triangles to achieve a desired property. We first focus on bridgeless cubic graphs and define the parameter $T(G)$ as the minimum number of vertices that need to be expanded into triangles so that the resulting cubic graph can be covered with four perfect matchings. We relate this parameter to the concept of shortest cycle cover. Furthermore, we show that if $5$-Cycle Double Cover Conejcture holds true, then $T(G)\leq \frac{2}{5} |V(G)|$. We conjecture a tighter bound, $T(G)\leq \frac{1}{10}|V(G)|$, which is optimal for the Petersen graph, and show that this bound follows from major conjectures like the Petersen Coloring Conjecture. In the second part of the paper, we introduce the parameter $t(G)$ as the minimum number of vertex expansions needed for the graph to admit a perfect matching. We prove a Gallai type identity: $t(G)+\ell(G)=|V(G)|$, where $\ell(G)$ is the number of edges in a largest even subgraph of $G$. Then we prove the general upper bound $t(G)&lt; \frac{1}{4}|V(G)|$ for cubic graphs, and $t(G)&lt; \frac{1}{6}|V(G)|$ for cubic graphs without parallel edges. We provide examples showing that these bounds are asymptotically tight. The paper concludes with a discussion of the computational complexity of determining these parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the planar Deza graphs. We also classify all regular polyhedra according to their type i.e., the collection of number of common neighbours that any pair of distinct vertices may have (polyhedra are planar, $3$-connected graphs).
  Among the classes of planar Deza graphs is an intriguing wide class of quartic polyhedra. We prove that these are the medial graphs of certain cubic polyhedra.
  Furthermore, within the aforementioned class of quartic polyhedral Deza graphs, we study the extremal graphs with respect to the ratio of number of triangular faces to the total. In the maximal extreme, we notably obtain the line graphs of cubic polyhedra of girth $5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial formula for the structure constants of spin Hall--Littlewood functions. This is achieved by representing these functions and the structure constants as the partition function of a lattice model and applying the underlying Yang--Baxter equation. Our combinatorial expression is in terms of generalised honeycombs; the latter were introduced by Knutson and Tao for ordinary Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and applied to the computation of Hall polynomials by Zinn--Justin.</description>

Abstract: Knecht considers the enumeration of coronas. This is a counting problem for two specific types of lozenge tilings. Their exact closed formulas are conjectured in [A380346] and [A380416] on the OEIS. We prove this conjecture by using the weighted adjacency matrix. Furthermore, we extend this result to a more general setting.</description>

      <title>Kneser's theorem for codes and $\ell$-divisible set families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-wise $\ell$-divisible set family is a collection $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of ${ \{1,\ldots,n \} }$ such that any intersection of $k$ sets in $\mathcal{F}$ has cardinality divisible by $\ell$. If $k=\ell=2$, it is well-known that $|\mathcal{F}|\leq 2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. We generalise this by proving that $|\mathcal{F}|\leq 2^{\lfloor n/p\rfloor}$ if $k=\ell=p$, for any prime number $p$.
  For arbitrary values of $\ell$, we prove that $4\ell^2$-wise $\ell$-divisible set families $\mathcal{F}$ satisfy $|\mathcal{F}|\leq 2^{\lfloor n/\ell\rfloor}$ and that the only families achieving the upper bound are atomic, meaning that they consist of all the unions of disjoint subsets of size $\ell$. This improves upon a recent result by Gishboliner, Sudakov and Timon, that arrived at the same conclusion for $k$-wise $\ell$-divisible families, with values of $k$ that behave exponentially in $\ell$.
  Our techniques rely heavily upon a coding-theory analogue of Kneser's Theorem from additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Projective systems and bounds on the length of codes of non-zero defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their 2007 book, Tsfasman and Vl\v{a}du\c{t} invite the reader to reinterpret existing coding theory results through the lens of projective systems. Redefining linear codes as projective systems provides a geometric vantage point. In this paper, we embrace this perspective, deriving bounds on the lengths of A$^s$MDS codes (codes with Singleton defect $s$). To help frame our discussions, we introduce the parameters $m^{s}(k,q)$, denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code, $m^{s}_t(k,q)$ denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code such that the dual code is an A$^t$MDS code, and $\kappa(s,q)$, representing the maximum dimension $k$ for which there exists a linear code of (maximal) length $n=(s+1)(q+1)+k-2$. In particular, we address a gap in the literature by providing sufficient conditions on $n$ and $k$ under which the dual of an $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code is also an A$^s$MDS code. Our results subsume or improve several results in the literature. Some conjectures arise from our findings.</description>

      <title>The partial derivative of ratios of Schur polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a ratio of Schur polynomials $s_{\lambda}/s_{\rho}$ associated to partitions $\lambda$ and $\rho$ such $\lambda\subsetneq\rho$ has a negative partial derivative at any point where all variables are positive. This is accomplished by establishing an injective map between sets of pairs of skew semistandard Young tableaux that preserves the product of the corresponding monomials. We use this result and the description of the first Laurent coefficient of the Hilbert series of the graded algebra of regular function on a linear symplectic quotient by the circle to demonstrate that many such symplectic quotients are not graded regularly diffeomorphic. In addition, we give an upper bound for this Laurent coefficient in terms of the largest two weights of the circle representation and demonstrate that all but finitely many circle symplectic quotients of each dimension are not graded regularly diffeomorphic to linear symplectic quotients by $\operatorname{SU}_2$.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular graphs in hyperbolic quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ be a hyperbolic quadric of $\rm PG(2n+1,q)$. Fix a generator $\Pi$ of the quadric. Define $\mathcal{G}_n$ as the graph with vertex set the points of $Q^+(2n+1,q)\setminus \Pi$ and two vertices adjacent if they either span a secant to $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ or a line contained in $Q^+(2n+1,q)$ meeting $\Pi$ non-trivially. We show that $\mathcal{G}_n$ is a strongly regular graph, that has, for $q=2$ the same parameters as the tangent graph $NO^+(2n+2,2)$, but which is non-isomorphic for $n\geq3$. Hence for $n \geq 3$, the graphs $\mathcal{G}_n$ are a putative new family of strongly regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Faithful universal graphs for minor-closed classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was proved by Huynh, Mohar, \v{S}\'amal, Thomassen and Wood in 2021 that any countable graph containing every countable planar graph as a subgraph has an infinite clique minor. We prove a finite, quantitative version of this result: for fixed $t$, if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free and contains every $n$-vertex planar graph as a subgraph, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ vertices. If $G$ contains every $n$-vertex toroidal graph instead, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vertices. On the other hand, we construct a polynomial size $K_4$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex tree as an induced subgraph, and a polynomial size $K_7$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex $K_4$-minor-free graph as induced subgraph. This answers several problems raised recently by Bergold, Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, Lauff, Orthaber, Scheucher and Wesolek.
  We study more generally the order of universal graphs for various classes (of graphs of bounded degree, treedepth, pathwidth, or treewidth), if the universal graphs retain some of the structure of the original class.</description>

      <title>Varieties of mutual-visibility and general position on Sierpi\'nski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variety of mutual-visibility problems contains four members, as does the variety of general position problems. The basic problem is to determine the cardinality of the largest such sets. In this paper, these eight invariants are investigated on Sierpi\'nski graphs $S_p^n$. They are determined for the Sierpi\'nski graphs $S_p^2$, $p\ge 3$. All, but the outer mutual-visibility number and the outer general position number, are also determined for $S_3^n$, $n\ge 3$. In many of the cases the corresponding extremal sets are enumerated.</description>

      <title>Identities involving partitions with distinct odd parts and no parts congruent to 2 mod 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Pankaj Jyoti Mahanta and Manjil P. Saikika proved some identities relating certain restricted partitions into distinct odd parts with the partition whose odd parts are distinct combinatorially. They asked for the q-series proofs. In this paper, we give q-series proofs of these identities. Also, the number of partitions into distinct odd parts equals to the number of the partitions with no parts congruent to 2 mod 4, so we can get some identities. We also give combinatorial proofs of these identities.</description>

      <title>On the Relation Between Treewidth, Tree-Independence Number, and Tree-Chromatic Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two recently introduced graph parameters, both of which measure the complexity of the tree decompositions of a given graph. Recall that the treewidth $\tw(G)$ of a graph $G$ measures the largest number of vertices required in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$. Similarly, the tree-independence number $\tree-alpha(G)$ and the tree-chromatic number $\tree-chi(G)$ measure the largest independence number, respectively the largest chromatic number, required in a bag of every tree decomposition of $G$.
  Recently, Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel asked (JCTB, 2024) whether for all graphs $G$ it holds that $\tw(G)+1 \leq \tree-alpha(G) \cdot \tree-chi(G)$. We answer that question in the negative, providing examples $G$ where $\tw(G)$ is roughly $2\cdot \tree-alpha(G) \cdot \tree-chi(G)$.
  For our approach we introduce $H$-subdivisions of $G$, which may be of independent interest, and give sharp bounds on the treewidth, tree-independence number, and tree-chromatic number of such graphs. Additionally, we give upper bounds on treewidth in terms of tree-independence number and tree-chromatic number that hold for all graphs $G$.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formulas of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <title>Determining a graph from its reconfiguration graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a natural number $k$, the $k$-recolouring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colourings of $G$ and whose edges link pairs of colourings which differ at exactly one vertex of $G$. Recently, Hogan et al. proved that $G$ can be determined from $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ provided $k$ is large enough (quadratic in the number of vertices of $G$). We improve this bound by showing that $k=\chi(G)+1$ colours suffice, and provide examples of families of graphs for which $k=\chi(G)$ colours do not suffice.
  We then extend this result to $k$-Kempe-recolouring graphs, whose vertices are again the $k$-colourings of a graph $G$ and whose edges link pairs of colourings which differ by swapping the two colours in a connected component induced by selecting those two colours. We show that $k=\chi(G)+2$ colours suffice to determine $G$ in this case.
  Finally, we investigate the case of independent set reconfiguration, proving that in only a few trivial cases is one guaranteed to be able to determine a graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Existence of most reliable two-terminal graphs with distance constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-terminal graph is a simple graph equipped with two distinguished vertices, called terminals. Let $T_{n,m}$ be the class consisting of all nonisomorphic two-terminal graphs on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Let $G$ be any two-terminal graph in $T_{n,m}$, and let $d$ be any positive integer. For each $\rho\in [0,1]$, the \emph{$d$-constrained two-terminal reliability of $G$ at $\rho$}, denoted $R_G^d(\rho)$, is the probability that $G$ has some path of length at most $d$ joining its terminals after each of its edges is independently deleted with probability $\rho$. We say $G$ is a \emph{$d$-uniformly most reliable two-terminal graph} ($d$-UMRTTG) if for each $H$ in $T_{n,m}$ and every $\rho \in [0,1]$ it holds that $R_{G}^d(\rho)\geq R_H^d(\rho)$. Previous works studied the existence of $d$-UMRTTG in $T_{n,m}$ when $d$ is greater than or equal to $n-1$, or equivalently, when the distance constraint is dropped. In this work, a characterization of all $1$-UMRTTGs and $2$-UMRTTGs is given. Then, it is proved that there exists a unique $3$-UMRTTG in $T_{n,m}$ when $n\geq 6$ and $5 \leq m \leq 2n-3$. Finally, for each $d\geq 4$ and each $n\geq 11$ it is proved that there is no $d$-UMRTTG in $T_{n,m}$ when $20 \leq m \leq 3n-9$ or when $3n-5 \leq m \leq \binom{n}{2}-2$.</description>

      <title>Separator-based derivations of graphic arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of subarrangements of the well-studied braid arrangement, so-called graphic hyperplane arrangements, is important for analysing new concepts and properties in hyperplane arrangement theory. While there is a nice characterization of free graphic arrangements, many interesting questions beyond the free case remain open. This paper introduces an explicit set of generators for the module of logarithmic derivations of a general graphic arrangement based on graph separators. We obtain new insights in the derivation degree sequence in the non-free case and give bounds on the highest degree in the sequence. Moreover, this can broadly be used for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>On one generalization of stable allocations in a two-sided market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the stable allocation problem on a two-sided market introduced and studied by Baiou and Balinski in the early 2000's, one is given a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ with capacities $b$ on the edges (``contracts'') and quotas $q$ on the vertices (``agents''). Each vertex $v\in V$ is endowed with a linear order on the set $E_v$ of edges incident to $v$, which generates preference relations among functions (``contract intensities'') on $E_v$, giving rise to a model of \it{stable allocations} for $G$. This is a special case of Alkan-Gale's stability model for a bipartite graph with edge capacities in which, instead of linear orders, the preferences of each ``agent'' $v$ are given via a choice function that acts on the box $\{z\in{\mathbb R}_+^{E_v}\colon z(e)\le b(e),\, e\in E_v\}$ or a closed subset in it and obeys the (well motivated) axioms of consistence, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity. By central results in Alkan-Gale's theory, the set of stable assignments generated by such choice functions is nonempty and forms a distributive lattice.
  In this paper, being in frameworks of Alkan-Gale's model and generalizing the stable allocation one, we consider the situation when the preferences of ``agents'' of one side (``workers'') are given via linear orders, whereas the ones of the other side (``firms'') via integer-valued choice functions subject to the three axioms as above, thus introducing the model of \it{generalized allocations}, or g-allocations for short. Our main aims are to characterize and efficiently construct rotations, functions on $E$ associated with immediately preceding relations in the lattice $(S,\prec)$ of stable g-allocations, and to estimate the complexity of constructing a poset generated by rotations for which the lattice of closed functions is isomorphic to $(S,\prec)$, obtaining a ``compact'' representation of the latter.</description>

      <title>Minimum Cost Nowhere-zero Flows and Cut-balanced Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flows and colorings are disparate concepts in graph algorithms -- the former is tractable while the latter is intractable. Tutte introduced the concept of nowhere-zero flows to unify these two concepts. Jaeger showed that nowhere-zero flows are equivalent to cut-balanced orientations. Motivated by connections between nowhere-zero flows, cut-balanced orientations, Nash-Williams' well-balanced orientations, and postman problems, we study optimization versions of nowhere-zero flows and cut-balanced orientations. Given a bidirected graph with asymmetric costs on two orientations of each edge, we study the min cost nowhere-zero $k$-flow problem and min cost $k$-cut-balanced orientation problem. We show that both problems are NP-hard to approximate within any finite factor. Given the strong inapproximability result, we design bicriteria approximations for both problems: we obtain a $(6,6)$-approximation to the min cost nowhere-zero $k$-flow and a $(k,6)$-approximation to the min cost $k$-cut-balanced orientation. For the case of symmetric costs (where the costs of both orientations are the same for every edge), we show that the nowhere-zero $k$-flow problem remains NP-hard and admits a $3$-approximation.</description>

      <title>Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for irreducible characters of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra on certain standard elements, which fully determine their values. This work builds upon our recent multi-parameter Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Macdonald polynomials. Our Murnaghan-Nakayama rule can be readily specialized to retrieve various existing rules, including those for the complex reflection group of type $G(m, 1, n)$ and the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in types $A$ and $B$. In a dual picture, we establish an iterative formula for the irreducible characters on upper multipartitions, utilizing the vertex operator realization of Schur functions.
  As applications we derive an Regev-type formula and an L\"ubeck-Prasad-Adin-Roichman-type formula for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, thereby extending the corresponding formulas for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in type $A$ and the complex reflection group of type $G(m,1,n)$ to the setting of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, respectively. Finally, we introduce the notion of the multiple bitrace of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra to formulate the second orthogonal relation of the irreducible characters. We also provide a general combinatorial rule to compute the multiple bitrace.</description>

      <title>Automatic Bounds on Constant Term Sequences Modulo Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides counterexamples to a previously conjectured upper bound on the first index $n_0$ at which a zero appears in constant term sequences of the form $A_p(n) = ct(P^n) \mod p$, where $P(t) \in \mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]$. The conjecture posited that the first zero must occur at some index $n_0 &lt; p^{\text{deg}(P)}$. We prove an automaton state-based bound for univariate polynomials $n_0 &lt; p^{\kappa(P, p)}$, where $\kappa(P, p)$ is the automaticity of $(A_p(n))_{n \geq 0}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We support our theoretical results with randomized experiments on low degree Laurent polynomials and propose the $\kappa(P, p)$ based bound as a practical alternative to the general worst case bound arising from the Rowland Zeilberger construction.</description>

      <title>On a Generalisation of a Function of Ron Graham's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ron Graham introduced a function, $g(n)$, on the non-negative integers, in the 1986 Issue $3$ Problems column of \textit{Mathematical Magazine}: For each non-negative integer $n$, $g(n)$ is the least integer $s$ so that the integers $n + 1, n + 2, \ldots , n + s$ contain a subset of integers, the product of whose members with $n$ is a square. Recently, many results about $g(n)$ were proved in [Kagey and Rajesh, ArXiv:2410.04728, 2024] and they conjectured a characterization of which $n$ satisfied $g(n)=2n$. For $m\geq 2$, they also introduced generalizations of $g(n)$ to $m$-th powers to explore. In this paper, we prove their conjecture and provide some results about these generalisations.</description>

Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem for insertion/deletion channels has attracted significant attention owing to their applications recently in some emerging data storage systems, such as racetrack memories, DNA-based data storage. Our goal is to investigate the reconstruction problem for sticky-insdel channels where both sticky-insertions and sticky-deletions occur. If there are only sticky-insertion errors, the reconstruction problem for sticky-insertion channel is a special case of the reconstruction problem for tandem-duplication channel which has been well-studied. In this work, we consider the $(t, s)$-sticky-insdel channel where there are at most $t$ sticky-insertion errors and $s$ sticky-deletion errors when we transmit a message through the channel. For the reconstruction problem, we are interested in the minimum number of distinct outputs from these channels that are needed to uniquely recover the transmitted vector. We first provide a recursive formula to determine the minimum number of distinct outputs required. Next, we provide an efficient algorithm to reconstruct the transmitted vector from erroneous sequences.</description>

      <title>Reduced Random Walks in the Hyperbolic Plane$\hspace{1pt}!\hspace{-3.8pt}?$</title>

Abstract: We study Lam's reduced random walk in a hyperbolic triangle group, which we view as a random walk in the upper half-plane. We prove that this walk converges almost surely to a point on the extended real line. We devote special attention to the reduced random walk in $PGL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (i.e., the $(2,3,\infty)$ triangle group). In this case, we provide an explicit formula for the cumulative distribution function of the limit. This formula is written in terms of the interrobang function, a new function $!\hspace{-3.8pt}?\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ that shares several of the remarkable analytic and arithmetic properties of Minkowski's question-mark function.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations are widely used to model irreversible processes in complex systems in physics. Recently, it has been studied that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We refer to these manifolds as finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations in probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, as well as Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a simplex set with a three-point lattice.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Finding Kings and Strong Kings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A king in a directed graph is a vertex $v$ such that every other vertex is reachable from $v$ via a path of length at most $2$. It is well known that every tournament (a complete graph where each edge has a direction) has at least one king. Our contributions in this work are:
  - We show that the query complexity of determining existence of a king in arbitrary $n$-vertex digraphs is $\Theta(n^2)$. This is in stark contrast to the case where the input is a tournament, where Shen, Sheng, and Wu [SICOMP'03] showed that a king can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ queries.
  - In an attempt to increase the "fairness" in the definition of tournament winners, Ho and Chang [IPL'03] defined a strong king to be a king $k$ such that, for every $v$ that dominates $k$, the number of length-$2$ paths from $k$ to $v$ is strictly larger than the number of length-$2$ paths from $v$ to $k$. We show that the query complexity of finding a strong king in a tournament is $\Theta(n^2)$. This answers a question of Biswas, Jayapaul, Raman, and Satti [DAM'22] in the negative.
  A key component in our proofs is the design of specific tournaments where every vertex is a king, and analyzing certain properties of these tournaments. We feel these constructions and properties are independently interesting and may lead to more interesting results about tournament solutions.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{i+2}{2}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>On post-Lie structures for free Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study post-Lie structures on free Lie algebras, the Grossman-Larson product on their enveloping algebras, and provide an abstract formula for its dual coproduct. This might be of interest for the general theory of post-Hopf algebras. Using a magmatic approach, we explore post-Lie algebras connected to multiple zeta values and their $q$-analogues. For multiple zeta values, this framework yields an algebraic interpretation of the Goncharov coproduct. Assuming that the Bernoulli numbers satisfy the so called threshold shuffle identities, we present a post-Lie structure, whose induced Lie bracket we expect to restrict to the dual of indecomposables of multiple $q$-zeta values. Our post-Lie algebras align with Ecalle's theory of bimoulds: we explicitly identify the ari bracket with a post-Lie structure on a free Lie algebra, and conjecture a correspondence for the uri bracket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.12443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fence is a poset with elements F = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} and covers x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; ... &lt; x_a &gt; x_{a+1} &gt; ... &gt; x_b &lt; x_{b+1} &lt; ... where a, b, ... are positive integers. We investigate rowmotion on antichains and ideals of F. In particular, we show that orbits of antichains can be visualized using tilings. This permits us to prove various homomesy results for the number of elements of an antichain or ideal in an orbit. Rowmotion on fences also exhibits a new phenomenon, which we call homometry, where the value of a statistic is constant on orbits of the same size. Along the way, we prove a general homomesy result for all self-dual posets. We end with some conjectures and avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>The Cheeger Inequality and Coboundary Expansion: Beyond Constant Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cheeger constant of a graph, or equivalently its coboundary expansion, quantifies the expansion of the graph. This notion assumes an implicit choice of a coefficient group, namely, $\mathbb{F}_2$. In this paper, we study Cheeger-type inequalities for graphs endowed with a generalized coefficient group, called a sheaf; this is motivated by applications to cosystolic expansion and locally testable codes. We prove that a graph is a good spectral expander if and only if it has good coboundary expansion relative to any (resp. some) constant sheaf, or equivalently, relative to any `ordinary' coefficient group. We moreover show that sheaves that are close to being constant in a well-defined sense are also good coboundary expanders, provided that their underlying graph is an expander, thus giving the first example of good coboundary expansion in non-cosntant sheaves on sparse graphs. By contrast, we observe that for general sheaves on graphs, it is impossible to relate the expansion of the graph and the coboundary expansion of the sheaf.
  We specialize our results to sheaves on (finite) spherical buildings. Specifically, we show that the normalized second eigenvalue of the (weighted) graph underlying a $q$-thick $d$-dimensional spherical building is $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{q}-3d})$ if $q&gt;9d^2$. Plugging this into our results about coboundary expansion gives explicit lower bounds on the coboundary expansion of some constant and non-constant sheaves on spherical buildings; for a fixed dimension $d$, the bounds approach a constant as the thickness $q$ grows.
  Along the way, we prove a new version of the Expander Mixing Lemma for $r$-partite weighted graphs.</description>

Abstract: We show that the cop number of the Cayley sum graph of a finite group $G$ with respect to a symmetric subset $S$ is at most twice its degree when the graph is connected, undirected. We also prove that a similar bound holds for the cop number of generalised Cayley graphs and twisted Cayley sum graphs under some conditions. These extend a result of Frankl to such graphs. Using the above bounds and a result of Bollob\'{a}s--Janson--Riordan, we show that the weak Meyniel conjecture holds for these algebraic graphs.</description>

Abstract: Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that every graph $G$ with $\Delta\ge9$ satisfies $\chi\le$ max $\{\omega, \Delta-1\}$. Gupta and Pradhan proved the Borodin-Kostochka conjecture for ($P_5$, $C_4$)-free graphs [{\em J. Appl. Math. Comp.} \textbf{65} (2021) 877-884]. In this paper, we prove the Borodin-Kostochka conjecture for ($P_6$, apple, torch)-free graphs, that is, graphs with no induced $P_6$, no induced $C_5$ with a hanging edge, and no induced $C_5$ and $C_4$ sharing exactly an induced $P_3$. This generalizes the result of Gupta and Pradhan from the perspective of allowing the existence of $P_5$.</description>

      <title>Local central limit theorem for triangle counts in sparse random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X_H$ be the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ in $G(n,p)$. In 2016, Gilmer and Kopparty conjectured that a local central limit theorem should hold for $X_H$ as long as $H$ is connected, $p\gg n^{-1/m(H)}$ and $n^2(1-p)\gg 1$, where $m(H)$ denotes the $m$-density of $H$. Recently, Sah and Sawhney showed that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for constant $p$. In this paper, we show that the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture holds for triangle counts in the sparse range. More precisely, if $p \in (4n^{-1/2}, 1/2)$, then $$\sup_{x\in \mathcal{L}}\left| \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}-\sigma\cdot \mathbb{P}(X^* = x)\right|=n^{-1/2+o(1)}p^{1/2},$$ where $\sigma^2 = \mathbb{V}\text{ar}(X_{K_3})$, $X^{*}=(X_{K_3}-\mathbb{E}(X_{K_3}))/\sigma$ and $\mathcal{L}$ is the support of $X^*$. By combining our result with the results of R\"ollin--Ross and Gilmer--Kopparty, this establishes the Gilmer--Kopparty conjecture for triangle counts for $n^{-1}\ll p &lt; c$, for any constant $c\in (0,1)$. Our quantitative result is enough to prove that the triangle counts converge to an associated normal distribution also in the $\ell_1$-distance. This is the first local central limit theorem for subgraph counts above the so-called $m_2$-density threshold.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06870v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion $\mathsf{OI}$, a concept analogous to M\"obius inversion on finite posets, which is applicable to order-preservings functions from a finite poset to the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(V)$ of an inner product space $V$. This notion critically relies on the inner product structure on $V$ enabling it to capture much finer information than standard integer-valued persistence diagrams.
  Orthogonal Inversion is a special case of the broader concept of Orthomodular Inversion, where the target space is any orthomodular lattice, which we also identify.
  We apply Orthogonal Inversion in order to construct a "non-negative" persistence diagram for any given multiparameter filtration $\mathsf{F}$ of a finite simplicial complex $K$, indexed over an arbitrary finite poset $P$. This is done by applying it to the birth-death spaces of $\mathsf{F}$. Analogously to $1$-parameter classical persistence diagrams, these multiparameter Grassmannian persistence diagrams offer straightforward interpretability. Specifically, to a segment $(b, d) \in \mathsf{Seg}(P)$, (1) the Grassmannian persistence diagram canonically assigns a vector subspace of $C_{\rho}^K$ consisting of cycles that are born at $b$ and become boundaries at $d$ and (2) this assignment is exhaustive at the homology level.
  Finally, we relate our Grassmannian persistence diagrams to the recently introduced notion of M\"obius homology, thus enhancing its interpretability through the lens of our framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring. The unitary addition Cayley graph of $R$, denoted $\mathcal{U}(R)$, is the graph with vertex $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x+y$ is a unit. We determine a formula for the clique number and chromatic number of such graphs when $R$ is a finite commutative ring with an odd number of elements. This includes the special case when $R$ is $\mathbb{Z}_n$, the integers modulo $n$, where these parameters had been found under the assumption that $n$ is even, or $n$ is a power of an odd prime. Additionally, we study the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z}_n )$ in the case that $n$ is the product of two primes. We prove that the achromatic number of $\mathcal{U} ( \mathbb{Z}_{3q})$ is equal to $\frac{3q+1}{2}$ when $q &gt; 3$ is a prime. We also prove a lower bound that applies when $n = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct odd primes.</description>

      <title>Bounds On MLDR Codes over ${\mathbb Z}_{p^t}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upper bounds on the minimum Lee distance of codes that are linear over ${\mathbb Z}_q$, $q=p^t$, $p$ prime are discussed. The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the length, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are referred to as Maximum Lee Distance with respect to Rank (MLDR) Codes. We present some new bounds on MLDR codes, using combinatorial arguments. In the context of MLDR codes, our work provides improvements over existing bounds in the literature</description>

      <title>A contribution to the characterization of finite minimal automorphic posets of width three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of the finite minimal automorphic posets of width three is still an open problem. Niederle has shown that this task can be reduced to the characterization of the nice sections of width three having a non-trivial tower of nice sections as retract. We solve this problem for a sub-class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ of the finite nice sections of width three. On the one hand, we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a retract of width three being a non-trivial tower of nice sections, and on the other hand we characterize the posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. The latter result yields a recursive approach for the determination of posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ having a 4-crown stack as retract. With this approach, we determine all posets in $\mathfrak{N}_2$ with height up to six having such a retract. For each integer $n \geq 2$, the class $\mathfrak{N}_2$ contains $2^{n-2}$ different isomorphism types of posets of height $n$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing finite groups whose order supergraphs satisfy a connectivity condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an undirected and simple graph. A set $ S $ of vertices in $\Gamma$ is called a {cyclic vertex cutset} of $\Gamma$ if $\Gamma - S$ is disconnected and has at least two components each containing a cycle. If $\Gamma$ has a cyclic vertex cutset, then it is said to be {cyclically separable}. For any finite group $G$, the order supergraph $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is the simple and undirected graph whose vertices are elements of $G$, and two vertices are adjacent if as elements of $G$ the order of one divides the order of the other. In this paper, we characterize the finite nilpotent groups and various non-nilpotent groups, such as the dihedral groups, the dicyclic groups, the EPPO groups, the symmetric groups, and the alternating groups, whose order supergraphs are cyclically separable.</description>

      <title>Representation Number of Word-Representable Split Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The word-representability of split graphs was studied in a series of papers in the literature, and the class of word-representable split graphs was characterized through semi-transitive orientation. Nonetheless, the representation number of this class of graphs is still not known. In general, determining the representation number of a word-representable graph is an NP-complete problem. In this work, through an algorithmic procedure, we show that the representation number of the class of word-representable split graphs is at most three. Further, we characterize the class of word-representable split graphs as well as the class of split comparability graphs which have representation number exactly three.</description>

      <title>Homology in Combinatorial Refraction Billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, we can project the graphical arrangement of $G$ to an $(n-1)$-dimensional torus to obtain a toric hyperplane arrangement. Adams, Defant, and Striker constructed a toric combinatorial refraction billiard system in which beams of light travel in the torus, refracting (with refraction coefficient $-1$) whenever they hit one of the toric hyperplanes in this toric arrangement. Each billiard trajectory in this system is periodic. We adopt a topological perspective and view the billiard trajectories as closed loops in the torus. We say $G$ is ensnaring if all of the billiard trajectories are contractible, and we say $G$ is expelling if none of the billiard trajectories is contractible. Our first main result states that a graph is expelling if and only if it is bipartite. We then provide several necessary conditions and several sufficient conditions for a graph to be ensnaring. For example, we show that the complement of an ensnaring graph cannot have a clique as a connected component. We also discuss ways to construct ensnaring graphs from other ensnaring graphs. For example, gluing two ensnaring graphs at a single vertex always yields another ensnaring graph.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Caro on $\mathbb{Z}_3$-Ramsey number of forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph. The zero-sum Ramsey number $R(G,\mathbb{Z}_k)$ is the least integer $N$ (if it exists) such that for every edge-coloring $\chi \, : \, E(K_N) \, \rightarrow \, \mathbb{Z}_k$ one can find a copy of $G$ in $K_N$ such that $\sum_{e \, \in \, E(G)}{\chi(e)} \, = \, 0$. In 2019, Caro made a conjecture about the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-Ramsey number of trees. In this paper, we settle this conjecture, fixing an incorrect case, and extend the result to forests. Namely, we show that \begin{equation*} R(F,\mathbb{Z}_3) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} n+2, &amp; \text{if $F$ is $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\ n+1, &amp; \text{if $3 \nmid d(v)$ for every $v \in V(F)$ or $F$ has exactly one} \\ \phantom{placeholder} &amp; \text{vertex of degree $0 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ and all others are $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$,} \\ \phantom{placeholder} &amp; \text{and $F$ is not $1 (\mathrm{mod}\, 3)$ regular or a star;}\\ n, &amp; \text{otherwise.} \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $F$ is any forest on $n$ vertices with $3\mid e(F)$ and no isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>Solving tiling enumeration problems by tensor network contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for computing the contraction of two-dimensional tensor networks on a square lattice; and we combine it with solving congruence equations to compute the exact enumeration (including weighted enumeration) of Wang tilings. Based on this, the paper demonstrates how to transform other tiling enumeration problems (such as those of polyominoes) into Wang tiling enumeration problems, thereby solving them using this algorithm.
  Our algorithm extends the sequence length records for dozens of sequences defined by polyomino tiling enumeration on chessboards on the OEIS website, covering numerous of different polyomino sets, including I-polyominoes, tetrominoes, pentominoes, etc. This demonstrates the high efficiency and strong universality of the algorithm for solving exact tiling enumeration problems.
  In addition, the theory and techniques used in the algorithm establish a bridge between tensor network contractions and tiling enumeration, where the former provides a theoretical foundation for solving problems in the latter, while the latter offers an intuitive combinatorial interpretation of the former.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that in a simple $K_{r+1}$ free graph, $m \leq \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r}$. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic configurations on a circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If we two-colour a circle, we can always find an inscribed triangle with angles $(\frac{\pi}{7},\frac{2\pi}{7},\frac{4\pi}{7})$ whose three vertices have the same colour. In fact, Bialostocki and Nielsen showed that it is enough to consider the colours on the vertices of an inscribed heptagon. We prove that for every other triangle $T$ there is a two-colouring of the circle without any monochromatic copy of $T$.
  More generally, for $k\geq 3$, call a $k$-tuple $(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_k)$ with $d_1\geq d_2\geq \dots \geq d_k&gt;0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k d_i=1$ a Ramsey $k$-tuple if the following is true: in every two-colouring of the circle of unit perimeter, there is a monochromatic $k$-tuple of points in which the distances of cyclically consecutive points, measured along the arcs, are $d_1,d_2,\dots,d_k$ in some order. By a conjecture of Stromquist, if $d_i=\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$, then $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey.
  Our main result is a proof of the converse of this conjecture. That is, we show that if $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey, then $d_i=\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$. We do this by finding connections of the problem to certain questions from number theory about partitioning $\mathbb{N}$ into so-called Beatty sequences. We also disprove a majority version of Stromquist's conjecture, study a robust version, and discuss a discrete version.</description>

      <title>Set families: restricted distances via restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $f_D(n)$ the maximum size of a set family $\mathcal{F}$ on $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$ with distance set $D$. That is, $|A \bigtriangleup B| \in D$ holds for every pair of distinct sets $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$. Kleitman's celebrated discrete isodiametric inequality states that $f_D(n)$ is maximized at Hamming balls of radius $d/2$ when $D = \{1, \dots, d\}$. We study the generalization where $D$ is a set of arithmetic progression and determine $f_D(n)$ asymptotically for all homogeneous $D$. In the special case when $D$ is an interval, our result confirms a conjecture of Huang, Klurman, and Pohoata. Moreover, we demonstrate a dichotomy in the growth of $f_D(n)$, showing linear growth in $n$ when $D$ is a non-homogeneous arithmetic progression. Different from previous combinatorial and spectral approaches, we deduce our results by converting the restricted distance problems to restricted intersection problems.
  Our proof ideas can be adapted to prove upper bounds on $t$-distance sets in Hamming cubes (also known as binary $t$-codes), which has been extensively studied by algebraic combinatorialists community, improving previous bounds from polynomial methods and optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Ordered Yao graphs: maximum degree, edge numbers, and clique numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$ and an ordered set of $n$ points in the plane, define its k-sector ordered Yao graphs as follows. Divide the plane around each point into $k$ equal sectors and draw an edge from each point to its closest predecessor in each of the $k$ sectors. We analyze several natural parameters of these graphs. Our main results are as follows:
  I) Let $d_k(n)$ be the maximum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has maximum degree at least $d_k(n)$. We show that $d_k(n)=n-1$ if $k=4$ or $k \ge 6$, and provide some estimates for the remaining values of $k$. Namely, we show that $d_1(n) = \Theta( \log_2n )$; $\frac{1}{2}(n-1) \le d_3(n) \le 5\left\lceil\frac{n}{6}\right\rceil-1$; $\frac{2}{3}(n-1) \le d_5(n) \le n-1$;
  II) Let $e_k(n)$ be the minimum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has at most $e_k(n)$ edges. Then $e_k(n)=\left\lceil\frac{k}{2}\right\rceil\cdot n-o(n)$.
  III) Let $w_k$ be the minimum integer so that for every point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has clique number at most $w_k$. Then $\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil \le w_k\le \lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil+1$.
  All the orders mentioned above can be constructed effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate possible large deviation principles (LDPs) for the $n$-vertex sampling from a given graphon with various speeds $s(n)$ and resolve all the cases except when the speed $s(n)$ is of order $n^2$.
  For quadratic speed $s=(c+o(1))n^2$, we establish an LDP for an arbitrary $k$-step graphon, which extends a result of Chatterjee and Varadhan [Europ. J. Combin., 32 (2011) 1000-1017] who did this for $k=1$ (that is, for the homogeneous binomial random graphs). This is done by reducing the problem to the LDP for stochastic $k$-block models established recently by Borgs, Chayes, Gaudio, Petti and Sen ["A large deviation principle for block models", arxiv:2007.14508, 2020]. Also, we improve some results by Borgs et al.</description>

Abstract: We study the $(k+1,k)$ diagonal map for $k=2,3,4,...$. We call this map $\Delta_k$. The map $\Delta_1$ is the pentagram map and $\Delta_k$ is a generalization. $\Delta_k$ does not preserve convexity, but we prove that $\Delta_k$ preserves a subset $B_k$ of certain star-shaped polygons which we call $k$-birds. The action of $\Delta_k$ on $B_k$ seems similar to the action of $\Delta_1$ on the space of convex polygons. We show that some classic geometric results about $\Delta_1$ generalize to this setting.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{k,n}$ be a group of permutations of $kn$ objects which permutes things independently in disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes the blocks. We investigate the probabilistic and/or enumerative aspects of random elements of $G_{k,n}$. This includes novel limit theorems for fixed points, cycles of various lengths, number of cycles and inversions. The limits are compound Poisson distributions with interesting dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>On Subgroup Separability and Membership Problems in Twisted Right-Angled Artin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize twisted right-angled Artin groups (T-RAAGs) that are subgroup separable using only their defining mixed graphs: such a group is subgroup separable if and only if the underlying simplicial graph contains neither induced paths nor squares on four vertices. This generalizes the results of Metaftsis-Raptis on classical right-angled Artin groups. Additionally, we show that the subgroup membership problem is decidable when the group is coherent, which occurs precisely when the defining mixed graph is chordal. We also address the rational and submonoid membership problems by exhibiting a cone-family of graphs for which the corresponding T-RAAGs have decidable rational and submonoid membership problems.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of graph coverings arising from a constant voltage assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of graph coverings that arise from a constant voltage assignment. We prove the existence and uniqueness (up to isomorphisms) of such towers. Furthermore, we study the Iwasawa invariants of these towers, and apply our results to towers of isogeny graphs enhanced with level structures, as well as towers arising from volcano graphs.</description>

      <title>A Question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham on Covering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham (Erd\H{o}s and Graham, 1980) asked if there exists an $n$ such that the divisors of $n$ greater than 1 are the moduli of a distinct covering system with the following property: If there exists an integer which satisfies two congruences in the system, $a\mod d$ and $a'\mod d'$, then $\gcd(d,d')=1$. We show that such an $n$ does not exist. This problem is part of Problem # 204 on the website www.erdosproblems.com, compiled and maintained by Thomas Bloom.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer between real pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories, demonstrating that under certain general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Building on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
