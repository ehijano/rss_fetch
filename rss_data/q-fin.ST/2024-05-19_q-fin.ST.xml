      <title>"Microstructure Modes" -- Disentangling the Joint Dynamics of Prices &amp; Order Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the micro-dynamics of asset prices in modern electronic order books is crucial for investors and regulators. In this paper, we use an order by order Eurostoxx database spanning over 3 years to analyze the joint dynamics of prices and order flow. In order to alleviate various problems caused by high-frequency noise, we propose a double coarse-graining procedure that allows us to extract meaningful information at the minute time scale. We use Principal Component Analysis to construct "microstructure modes" that describe the most common flow/return patterns and allow one to separate them into bid-ask symmetric and bid-ask anti-symmetric. We define and calibrate a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model that encodes the dynamical evolution of these modes. The parameters of the VAR model are found to be extremely stable in time, and lead to relatively high $R^2$ prediction scores, especially for symmetric liquidity modes. The VAR model becomes marginally unstable as more lags are included, reflecting the long-memory nature of flows and giving some further credence to the possibility of "endogenous liquidity crises". Although very satisfactory on several counts, we show that our VAR framework does not account for the well known square-root law of price impact.</description>

      <title>Price predictability at ultra-high frequency: Entropy-based randomness test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the statistical properties of Shannon entropy estimator and Kullback-Leibler divergence to study the predictability of ultra-high frequency financial data. We develop a statistical test for the predictability of a sequence based on empirical frequencies. We show that the degree of randomness grows with the increase of aggregation level in transaction time. We also find that predictable days are usually characterized by high trading activity, i.e., days with unusually high trading volumes and the number of price changes. We find a group of stocks for which predictability is caused by a frequent change of price direction. We study stylized facts that cause price predictability such as persistence of order signs, autocorrelation of returns, and volatility clustering. We perform multiple testing for sub-intervals of days to identify whether there is predictability at a specific time period during the day.</description>
