      <title>Structure Preserving PINN for Solving Time Dependent PDEs with Periodic Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structure preserving PINN for solving a series of time dependent PDEs with periodic boundary. Our method can incorporate the periodic boundary condition as the natural output of any deep neural net, hence significantly improving the training accuracy of baseline PINN. Together with mini-batching and other PINN variants (SA-PINN, RBA-PINN, etc.), our structure preserving PINN can even handle stiff PDEs for modeling a wide range of convection-diffusion and reaction-diffusion processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PINNs on various PDEs from Allen Cahn, Gray Scott to nonlinear Schrodinger.</description>

      <title>Improved impedance inversion by deep learning and iterated graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have shown significant potential in many applications through recent years. The achieved results often outperform traditional techniques. However, the quality of a neural network highly depends on the used training data. Noisy, insufficient, or biased training data leads to suboptimal results.
  We present a hybrid method that combines deep learning with iterated graph Laplacian and show its application in acoustic impedance inversion which is a routine procedure in seismic explorations. A neural network is used to obtain a first approximation of the underlying acoustic impedance and construct a graph Laplacian matrix from this approximation. Afterwards, we use a Tikhonov-like variational method to solve the impedance inversion problem where the regularizer is based on the constructed graph Laplacian. The obtained solution can be shown to be more accurate and stable with respect to noise than the initial guess obtained by the neural network. This process can be iterated several times, each time constructing a new graph Laplacian matrix from the most recent reconstruction. The method converges after only a few iterations returning a much more accurate reconstruction.
  We demonstrate the potential of our method on two different datasets and under various levels of noise. We use two different neural networks that have been introduced in previous works. The experiments show that our approach improves the reconstruction quality in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Arterial Blood Flow Simulations through Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a computational approach leveraging physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the efficient computation of arterial blood flows, particularly focusing on solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by using the domain decomposition technique. Unlike conventional computational fluid dynamics methods, PINNs offer advantages by eliminating the need for discretized meshes and enabling the direct solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we propose the weighted Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WXPINNs) and weighted Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks (WCPINNs), tailored for detailed hemodynamic simulations based on generalized space-time domain decomposition techniques. The inclusion of multiple neural networks enhances the representation capacity of the weighted PINN methods. Furthermore, the weighted PINNs can be efficiently trained in parallel computing frameworks by employing separate neural networks for each sub-domain. We show that PINNs simulation results circumvent backflow instabilities, underscoring a notable advantage of employing PINNs over traditional numerical methods to solve such complex blood flow models. They naturally address such challenges within their formulations. The presented numerical results demonstrate that the proposed weighted PINNs outperform traditional PINNs settings, where sub-PINNs are applied to each subdomain separately. This study contributes to the integration of deep learning methodologies with fluid mechanics, paving the way for accurate and efficient high-fidelity simulations in biomedical applications, particularly in modeling arterial blood flow.</description>

      <title>Local training and enrichment based on a residual localization strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To efficiently tackle parametrized multi and/or large scale problems, we propose an adaptive localized model order reduction framework combining both local offline training and local online enrichment with localized error control. For the latter, we adapt the residual localization strategy introduced in [Buhr, Engwer, Ohlberger, Rave, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2017] which allows to derive a localized a posteriori error estimator that can be employed to adaptively enrich the reduced solution space locally where needed. Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method for discrete network (graph) models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a time-dependent discrete network model with highly varying connectivity. The approximation by time is performed using an implicit scheme. We propose the coarse scale approximation construction of network models based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method. An accurate coarse-scale approximation is generated by solving local spectral problems in sub-networks. Convergence analysis of the proposed method is presented for semi-discrete and discrete network models. We establish the stability of the multiscale discrete network. Numerical results are presented for structured and random heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Implicit-Explicit schemes for decoupling multicontinuum problems in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient way to decouple the multicontinuum problems. To construct decoupled schemes, we propose Implicit-Explicit time approximation in general form and study them for the fine-scale and coarse-scale space approximations. We use a finite-volume method for fine-scale approximation, and the nonlocal multicontinuum (NLMC) method is used to construct an accurate and physically meaningful coarse-scale approximation. The NLMC method is an accurate technique to develop a physically meaningful coarse scale model based on defining the macroscale variables. The multiscale basis functions are constructed in local domains by solving constraint energy minimization problems and projecting the system to the coarse grid. The resulting basis functions have exponential decay properties and lead to the accurate approximation on a coarse grid. We construct a fully Implicit time approximation for semi-discrete systems arising after fine-scale and coarse-scale space approximations. We investigate the stability of the two and three-level schemes for fully Implicit and Implicit-Explicit time approximations schemes for multicontinuum problems in fractured porous media. We show that combining the decoupling technique with multiscale approximation leads to developing an accurate and efficient solver for multicontinuum problems.</description>

      <title>Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models for fluid-porous systems: derivation, analysis and validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy's law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes-Brinkman-Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.</description>

      <title>Fast Machine-Precision Spectral Likelihoods for Stationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide in this work an algorithm for approximating a very broad class of symmetric Toeplitz matrices to machine precision in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time. In particular, for a Toeplitz matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ with values $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{j,k} = h_{|j-k|} = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{2 \pi i |j-k| \omega} S(\omega) \mathrm{d} \omega$ where $S(\omega)$ is piecewise smooth, we give an approximation $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^H \approx \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{U} \mathbf{V}^H$, where $\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}$ is the DFT matrix, $\mathbf{D}$ is diagonal, and the matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times r}$ with $r \ll n$. Studying these matrices in the context of time series, we offer a theoretical explanation of this structure and connect it to existing spectral-domain approximation frameworks. We then give a complete discussion of the numerical method for assembling the approximation and demonstrate its efficiency for improving Whittle-type likelihood approximations, including dramatic examples where a correction of rank $r = 2$ to the standard Whittle approximation increases the accuracy from $3$ to $14$ digits for a matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma} \in \mathbb{R}^{10^5 \times 10^5}$. The method and analysis of this work applies well beyond time series analysis, providing an algorithm for extremely accurate direct solves with a wide variety of symmetric Toeplitz matrices. The analysis employed here largely depends on asymptotic expansions of oscillatory integrals, and also provides a new perspective on when existing spectral-domain approximation methods for Gaussian log-likelihoods can be particularly problematic.</description>

      <title>Numerical integrators for confined Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze numerical methods for weak approximation of underdamped (kinetic) Langevin dynamics in bounded domains. First-order methods are based on an Euler-type scheme interlaced with collisions with the boundary. To achieve second order, composition schemes are derived based on decomposition of the generator into collisional drift, impulse, and stochastic momentum evolution. In a deterministic setting, this approach would typically lead to first-order approximation, even in symmetric compositions, but we find that the stochastic method can provide second-order weak approximation with a single gradient evaluation, both at finite times and in the ergodic limit. We provide theoretical and numerical justification for this observation using model problems and compare and contrast the numerical performance of different choices of the ordering of the terms in the splitting scheme.</description>

      <title>Comparison of adaptive mesh refinement techniques for numerical weather prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the field of numerical weather prediction (NWP). We implement and assess two distinct AMR approaches and evaluate their performance through standard NWP benchmarks. In both cases, we solve the fully compressible Euler equations, fundamental to many non-hydrostatic weather models.
  The first approach utilizes oct-tree cell-based mesh refinement coupled with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for spatial discretization. In the second approach, we employ level-based AMR with the finite difference method. Our study provides insights into the accuracy and benefits of employing these AMR methodologies for the multi-scale problem of NWP. Additionally, we explore essential properties including their impact on mass and energy conservation. Moreover, we present and evaluate an AMR solution transfer strategy for the tree-based AMR approach that is simple to implement, memory-efficient, and ensures conservation for both flow in the box and sphere.
  Furthermore, we discuss scalability, performance portability, and the practical utility of the AMR methodology within an NWP framework -- crucial considerations in selecting an AMR approach. The current de facto standard for mesh refinement in NWP employs a relatively simplistic approach of static nested grids, either within a general circulation model or a separately operated regional model with loose one-way synchronization. It is our hope that this study will stimulate further interest in the adoption of AMR frameworks like AMReX in NWP. These frameworks offer a triple advantage: a robust dynamic AMR for tracking localized and consequential features such as tropical cyclones, extreme scalability, and performance portability.</description>

      <title>A new way of deriving implicit Runge-Kutta methods based on repeated integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runge-Kutta methods have an irreplaceable position among numerical methods designed to solve ordinary differential equations. Especially, implicit ones are suitable for approximating solutions of stiff initial value problems. We propose a new way of deriving coefficients of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. This approach based on repeated integrals yields both new and well-known Butcher's tableaux. We discuss the properties of newly derived methods and compare them with standard collocation implicit Runge-Kutta methods in a series of numerical experiments. In particular, we observe higher accuracy and higher experimental order of convergence of some newly derived methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the construction and analysis of a class of domain decomposition methods for the iterative solution of the quasi-static Biot problem in three-field formulation. The considered discrete model arises from time discretization by the implicit Euler method and space discretization by a family of strongly mass-conserving methods exploiting $H^{div}$-conforming approximations of the solid displacement and fluid flux fields. For the resulting saddle-point problem, we construct monolithic overlapping domain decomposition (DD) methods whose analysis relies on a transformation into an equivalent symmetric positive definite system and on stable decompositions of the involved finite element spaces under proper problem-dependent norms. Numerical results on two-dimensional test problems are in accordance with the provided theoretical uniform convergence estimates for the two-level multiplicative Schwarz method.</description>

      <title>A non-separable progressive multivariate WENO-$2r$ point value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted essentially non-oscillatory {technique} using a stencil of $2r$ points (WENO-$2r$) is an interpolatory method that consists in obtaining a higher approximation order from the non-linear combination of interpolants of $r+1$ nodes. The result is an interpolant of order $2r$ at the smooth parts and order $r+1$ when an isolated discontinuity falls at any grid interval of the large stencil except at the central one. Recently, a new WENO method based on Aitken-Neville's algorithm has been designed for interpolation of equally spaced data at the mid-points and presents progressive order of accuracy close to discontinuities. This paper is devoted to constructing a general progressive WENO method for non-necessarily uniformly spaced data and several variables interpolating in any point of the central interval. Also, we provide explicit formulas for linear and non-linear weights and prove the order obtained. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to check the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin Schemes for Ideal MHD Equations: Locally Divergence-Free and Positivity-Preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops structure-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) schemes for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), as a sequel to our recent work [Peng, Sun, and Wu, OEDG: Oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin method for hyperbolic conservation laws, 2023]. The schemes are based on a locally divergence-free (LDF) oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure to suppress spurious oscillations while maintaining many of the good properties of original DG schemes, such as conservation, local compactness, and optimal convergence rates. The OE procedure is built on the solution operator of a novel damping equation -- a simple linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose exact solution can be exactly formulated. Because this OE procedure does not interfere with DG spatial discretization and RK stage update, it can be easily incorporated to existing DG codes as an independent module. These features make the proposed LDF OEDG schemes highly efficient and easy to implement.In addition, we present a positivity-preserving (PP) analysis of the LDF OEDG schemes on Cartesian meshes via the optimal convex decomposition technique and the geometric quasi-linearization (GQL) approach. Efficient PP LDF OEDG schemes are obtained with the HLL flux under a condition accessible by the simple local scaling PP limiter.Several one- and two-dimensional MHD tests confirm the accuracy, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed structure-preserving OEDG schemes.</description>

      <title>A Test Problem for Flow Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder. We choose a range of Reynolds numbers for which the flow is time-dependent but can be characterized as essentially two-dimensional. The test problem requires accurate resolution of chaotic dynamics over a long time interval. It also requires the use of a relatively large computational domain, part of which is curved, and it requires evaluation of derivatives of the solution and pressure on the curved boundary. We review the performance of different finite element methods for the proposed range of Reynolds numbers. These tests indicate that some of the most established methods do not capture the correct behavior.</description>

Abstract: We present a velocity-based Monte Carlo fluid solver that overcomes the limitations of its existing vorticity-based counterpart. Because the velocity-based formulation is more commonly used in graphics, our Monte Carlo solver can be readily extended with various techniques from the fluid simulation literature. We derive our method by solving the Navier-Stokes equations via operator splitting and designing a pointwise Monte Carlo estimator for each substep. We reformulate the projection and diffusion steps as integration problems based on the recently introduced walk-on-boundary technique [Sugimoto et al. 2023]. We transform the volume integral arising from the source term of the pressure Poisson equation into a form more amenable to practical numerical evaluation. Our resulting velocity-based formulation allows for the proper simulation of scenes that the prior vorticity-based Monte Carlo method [Rioux-Lavoie and Sugimoto et al. 2022] either simulates incorrectly or cannot support. We demonstrate that our method can easily incorporate advancements drawn from conventional non-Monte Carlo methods by showing how one can straightforwardly add buoyancy effects, divergence control capabilities, and numerical dissipation reduction methods, such as advection-reflection and PIC/FLIP methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Inference in McKean-Vlasov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer the potential $W$ itself at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Ethanol Blending Effects on Auto-Ignition and Heat Release in n-Heptane/Ethanol Non-Premixed Flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the auto-ignition temperature of n-heptane and ethanol mixtures within a counterflow flame configuration under low strain rate, with a particular focus on the impact of ethanol blending on heat release rates. Employing the sensitivity analysis method inspired by Zurada's sensitivity approach for neural network, this study identifies the group of critical species influencing the heat release rate. Further analysis concentration change reveals the intricate interactions among these various radicals across different temperature zones. It is found that, in n-heptane dominant mixtures, inhibition of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) caused by additional ethanol, impacts heat release rate at high temperature zone through diffusion effect of specific radicals such as CH2O, C2H4, C3H6 and H2O2. For ethanol-dominant mixtures, an increase in heat release rate was observed with higher ethanol fraction. Further concentration change analysis elucidated it is primarily attributed to the decomposition of ethanol and its subsequent reactions. This research underscores the significance of incorporating both chemical kinetics and species diffusion effects when analyzing the counterflow configuration of complex fuel mixtures.</description>

      <title>hp-version analysis for arbitrarily shaped elements on the boundary discontinuous Galerkin method for Stokes systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine and analyze an hp-version interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the numerical approximation of a steady fluid system on computational meshes consisting of polytopic elements on the boundary. This approach is based on the discontinuous Galerkin method, enriched by arbitrarily shaped elements techniques as has been introduced in [13]. In this framework, and employing extensions of trace, Markov-type, and H1/L2-type inverse estimates to arbitrary element shapes, we examine a stationary Stokes fluid system enabling the proof of the inf/sup condition and the hp- a priori error estimates, while we investigate the optimal convergence rates numerically. This approach recovers and integrates the flexibility and superiority of the discontinuous Galerkin methods for fluids whenever geometrical deformations are taking place by degenerating the edges, facets, of the polytopic elements only on the boundary, combined with the efficiency of the hp-version techniques based on arbitrarily shaped elements without requiring any mapping from a given reference frame.</description>

      <title>ANOVA approximation with mixed tensor product basis on scattered points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider an orthonormal basis, generated by a tensor product of Fourier basis functions, half period cosine basis functions, and the Chebyshev basis functions. We deal with the approximation problem in high dimensions related to this basis and design a fast algorithm to multiply with the underlying matrix, consisting of rows of the non-equidistant Fourier matrix, the non-equidistant cosine matrix and the non-equidistant Chebyshev matrix, and its transposed. This leads us to an ANOVA (analysis of variance) decomposition for functions with partially periodic boundary conditions through using the Fourier basis in some dimensions and the half period cosine basis or the Chebyshev basis in others. We consider sensitivity analysis in this setting, in order to find an adapted basis for the underlying approximation problem. More precisely, we find the underlying index set of the multidimensional series expansion. Additionally, we test this ANOVA approximation with mixed basis at numerical experiments, and refer to the advantage of interpretable results.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript examines the problem of nonlinear stochastic fractional neutral integro-differential equations with weakly singular kernels. Our focus is on obtaining precise estimates to cover all possible cases of Abel-type singular kernels. Initially, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on the initial value of the true solution, assuming a local Lipschitz condition and linear growth condition. Additionally, we develop the Euler-Maruyama method for the numerical solution of the equation and prove its strong convergence under the same conditions as the well-posedness. Moreover, we determine the accurate convergence rate of this method under global Lipschitz conditions and linear growth conditions.</description>

      <title>A Transient Thermal Model for Power Electronics Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equation based reduced order model applicable to generalized heat equation and thermal simulations of power electronics systems developed in commercial CFD tools, is presented in this work. The model considers the physics of heat transfer between multiple objects in different mediums and presents a set of equations that can be applied to a wide range of heat transfer scenarios including conduction, natural and forced convection problems. A few case studies including heat transfer in a power electronic system are simulated in Ansys Icepak and the temperatures from the simulations are compared with the temperatures predicted by the models. The models are observed to be highly accurate when compared with the simulations. The predictive model described in this work reduces large complex simulations down to a few parameters which tremendously improves the computation speed, uses very low physical disk space and enables fast evaluation of thermal performance of the system for any changes in the input parameters.</description>

      <title>On incomplete Cholesky factorizations in half precision arithmetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomplete factorizations have long been popular general-purpose algebraic preconditioners for solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Guaranteeing the factorization is breakdown free while computing a high quality preconditioner is challenging. A resurgence of interest in using low precision arithmetic makes the search for robustness more urgent and tougher. In this paper, we focus on symmetric positive definite problems and explore a number of approaches: a look-ahead strategy to anticipate break down as early as possible, the use of global shifts, and a modification of an idea developed in the field of numerical optimization for the complete Cholesky factorization of dense matrices. Our numerical simulations target highly ill-conditioned sparse linear systems with the goal of computing the factors in half precision arithmetic and then achieving double precision accuracy using mixed precision refinement.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Particle Filters for Partially Observed McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the filtering problem associated to partially observed McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The model consists of data that are observed at regular and discrete times and the objective is to compute the conditional expectation of (functionals) of the solutions of the SDE at the current time. This problem, even the ordinary SDE case is challenging and requires numerical approximations. Based upon the ideas in [3, 12] we develop a new particle filter (PF) and multilevel particle filter (MLPF) to approximate the afore-mentioned expectations. We prove under assumptions that, for $\epsilon&gt;0$, to obtain a mean square error of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ the PF has a cost per-observation time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and the MLPF costs $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ (best case) or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4}\log(\epsilon)^2)$ (worst case). Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Modifying the Asynchronous Jacobi Method for Data Corruption Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moving scientific computation from high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing (CC) environments to devices on the edge, i.e., physically near instruments of interest, has received tremendous interest in recent years. Such edge computing environments can operate on data in-situ, offering enticing benefits over data aggregation to HPC and CC facilities that include avoiding costs of transmission, increased data privacy, and real-time data analysis. Because of the inherent unreliability of edge computing environments, new fault tolerant approaches must be developed before the benefits of edge computing can be realized. Motivated by algorithm-based fault tolerance, a variant of the asynchronous Jacobi (ASJ) method is developed that achieves resilience to data corruption by rejecting solution approximations from neighbor devices according to a bound derived from convergence theory. Numerical results on a two-dimensional Poisson problem show the new rejection criterion, along with a novel approximation to the shortest path length on which the criterion depends, restores convergence for the ASJ variant in the presence of certain types data corruption. Numerical results are obtained for when the singular values in the analytic bound are approximated. A linear system with a more dense sparsity pattern is also explored. All results indicate that successful resilience to data corruption depends on whether the bound tightens fast enough to reject corrupted data before the iteration evolution deviates significantly from that predicted by the convergence theory defining the bound. This observation generalizes to future work on algorithm-based fault tolerance for other asynchronous algorithms, including upcoming approaches that leverage Krylov subspaces.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic simulations of the size dependence of the Curie temperature in ferromagnetic nanowires and nanolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the finite-temperature regime, where thermal fluctuations are modeled by a random magnetic field whose variance is proportional to the temperature. By rescaling the temperature proportionally to the computational cell size $\Delta x$ ($T \to T\,\Delta x/a_{\text{eff}}$, where $a_{\text{eff}}$ is the lattice constant) [M. B. Hahn, J. Phys. Comm., 3:075009, 2019], we obtain Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}$ that are in line with the experimental values for cobalt, iron and nickel. For finite-sized objects such as nanowires (1D) and nanolayers (2D), the Curie temperature varies with the smallest size $d$ of the system. We show that the difference between the computed finite-size $T_{\text{C}}$ and the bulk $T_{\text{C}}$ follows a power-law of the type: $(\xi_0/d)^\lambda$, where $\xi_0$ is the correlation length at zero temperature, and $\lambda$ is a critical exponent. We obtain values of $\xi_0$ in the nanometer range, also in accordance with other simulations and experiments. The computed critical exponent is close to $\lambda=2$ for all considered materials and geometries. This is the expected result for a mean-field approach, but slightly larger than the values observed experimentally.</description>
