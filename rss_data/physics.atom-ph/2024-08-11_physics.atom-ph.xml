      <title>Strong-field ionization with few-cycle, mid-infrared laser pulses induces a localized ionization followed by long-lasting charge migration in halogenated organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that applying a few-femtosecond mid-infrared laser pulse parallel to the backbone of a halogenated, conjugated organic molecule induces localized ionization followed by long-lasting field-free charge migration (CM). Through time-dependent density-functional theory calculations, we find that this CM is robust with respect to the parameters of the applied laser pulse. We document the spatial and temporal origin of the localized hole, which is initiated via strong-field tunnel ionization in the halogen end of the molecule, and near the peak of the laser electric field. In bromobutadiyne we find a range of wavelengths around $1500~\text{nm}$ that consistently leads to the initiation of high-contrast CM. In addition, we show that the inclusion of Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics does not disrupt the creation of the localized hole, nor the subsequent CM motion, in bromobutadiyne or \emph{para}-bromoaniline.</description>

      <title>Domain formation and structural stabilities in mixed-species Coulomb crystals induced by sympathetically cooled highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in high-precision spectroscopy and frequency metrology for fundamental studies using sympathetically cooled highly charged ions (HCIs) embedded in Coulomb crystals of laser-cooled ions. In order to understand how their strong repulsion affects the crystal structure and dynamics, we study the thermal motion and rearrangement of small mixed linear and homogeneous crystals by both measurements and simulations. Co-crystallized HCIs divide the crystal into domains, where different reordering rates, melting points and localized phase transitions are observed due to decoupling of motional modes across boundaries. These results improve our understanding of homogeneous and inhomogeneous ion strings over a wide range of charge-to-mass ratios. This allows us to test our own simulations of the dynamic behavior of ion strings and gives us confidence in their suitability for applications related to quantum simulation as well as computing and the search for new physics.</description>

      <title>Probing (Ultra-) Light Dark Matter Using Synchrotron Based M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to search for (ultra)-light scalar dark matter (DM) using synchrotron radiation based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy technique. Such DM induces temporal variation in various fundamental constants, which in turn causes time modulation of the nuclear transition energies. When a M\"ossbauer source and absorber is separated by a large baseline, the DM induced shift between their energy levels can be tested by the modulation of the photon absorption spectrum. The narrow M\"ossbauer transitions allow the setup to efficiently probe DM in the high frequency range. We show that the reach of a M\"ossbauer experiment with the existing synchrotron beams is at par with the bounds from various equivalence principle violation searches. An improvement of the synchrotron setup would enable us to probe the hitherto uncharted territory of the DM parameter space upto MHz frequency. The proposed method would extend the DM search beyond the EP limit by several orders of magnitude, and would provide the best bound on DM interaction strength with various standard model fields in the high ($&gt;$kHz) frequency region.</description>
