      <title>The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of tensors.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Crossing Numbers of Cartesian Products with Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the crossing numbers of Cartesian products of small graphs with arbitrarily large paths has been an ongoing topic of research since the 1970s. Doing so requires the establishment of coincident upper and lower bounds; the former is usually demonstrated by providing a suitable drawing procedure, while the latter often requires substantial theoretical arguments. Many such papers have been published, which typically focus on just one or two small graphs at a time, and use ad hoc arguments specific to those graphs. We propose a general approach which, when successful, establishes the required lower bound. This approach can be applied to the Cartesian product of any graph with arbitrarily large paths, and in each case involves solving a modified version of the crossing number problem on a finite number (typically only two or three) of small graphs. We demonstrate the potency of this approach by applying it to Cartesian products involving all 133 graphs $G$ of orders five or six, and show that it is successful in 128 cases. This includes 60 cases which a recent survey listed as either undetermined, or determined only in journals without adequate peer review.</description>

      <title>A New Notion of Regularity: Finite State Automata Accepting Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogous to regular string and tree languages, regular languages of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are defined in the literature. Although called regular, those DAG-languages are more powerful and, consequently, standard problems have a higher complexity than in the string case. Top-down as well as bottom-up deterministic DAG languages are subclasses of the regular DAG languages. We refine this hierarchy by providing a weaker subclass of the deterministic DAG languages. For a DAG grammar generating a language in this new DAG language class, or, equivalently, a DAG-automaton recognizing it, a classical deterministic finite state automaton (DFA) can be constructed. As the main result, we provide a characterization of this class.
  The motivation behind this is the transfer of techniques for regular string languages to graphs. Trivially, our restricted DAG language class is closed under union and intersection. This permits the application of minimization and hyper-minimization algorithms known for DFAs. This alternative notion of regularity coins at the existence of a DFA for recognizing a DAG language.

      <title>Deterministic approximation for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a deterministic polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, where the truncation is by restricting each variable to the interval $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$, and $\delta\le \frac{C}{\Delta}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. We also generalise our result to the fractional matching polytope for hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum hyperedge size $k$, truncated by $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$ as well, where $\delta\le C\Delta^{-\frac{2k-3}{k-1}}k^{-1}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. The latter result generalises both the first result for graphs (when $k=2$), and a result by Bencs and Regts (2024) for the truncated independence polytope (when $\Delta=2$). Our approach is based on the cluster expansion technique.</description>

      <title>Search for an Immobile Hider on a Binary Tree with Unreliable Locational Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial search of a network for an immobile Hider (or target) was introduced and solved for rooted trees by Gal (1979). In this zero-sum game, a Hider picks a point to hide on the tree and a Searcher picks a unit speed trajectory starting at the root. The payoff (to the Hider) is the search time. In Gal's model (and many subsequent investigations), the Searcher receives no additional information after the Hider chooses his location. In reality, the Searcher will often receive such locational information. For homeland security, mobile sensors on vehicles have been used to locate radioactive material stashed in an urban environment. In a military setting, mobile sensors can detect chemical signatures from land mines. In predator-prey search, the predator often has specially attuned senses (hearing for wolves, vision for eagles, smell for dogs, sonar for bats, pressure sensors for sharks) that may help it locate the prey. How can such noisy locational information be used by the Searcher to modify her route? We model such information as signals which indicate which of two branches of a binary tree should be searched first, where the signal has a known accuracy p&lt;1. Our solution calculates which branch (at every branch node) is favored, meaning it should always be searched first when the signal is in that direction. When the signal is in the other direction, we calculate the probability the signal should be followed. Compared to the optimal Hider strategy in the classic search game of Gal, the Hider's optimal distribution for this model is more skewed towards leaf nodes that are further from the root.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Hypergraphs Arising in Cellular Mobile Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An assumption that researchers have often used to model interference in a wireless network is the unit disk graph model. While many theoretical results and performance guarantees have been obtained under this model, an open research direction is to extend these results to hypergraph interference models. Motivated by recent results that the worst-case performance of the distributed maximal scheduling algorithm is characterized by the interference degree of the hypergraph, in the present work we investigate properties of the interference degree of the hypergraph and the structure of hypergraphs arising from physical constraints. We show that the problem of computing the interference degree of a hypergraph is NP-hard and we prove some properties and results concerning this hypergraph invariant. We investigate which hypergraphs are realizable, i.e. which hypergraphs arise in practice, based on physical constraints, as the interference model of a wireless network. In particular, a question that arises naturally is: what is the maximal value of $r$ such that the hypergraph $K_{1,r}$ is realizable? We determine this quantity for various integral and nonintegral values of the path loss exponent of signal propagation. We also investigate hypergraphs generated by line networks.</description>

      <title>Counting Circuit Double Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a counting version of Cycle Double Cover Conjecture. We discuss why it is more interesting to count circuits (i.e., graphs isomorphic to $C_k$ for some $k$) instead of cycles (graphs with all degrees even). We give an almost-exponential lower-bound for graphs with a surface embedding of representativity at least 4. We also prove an exponential lower-bound for planar graphs. We conjecture that any bridgeless cubic graph has at least $2^{n/2-1}$ circuit double covers and we show an infinite class of graphs for which this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding expert knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with expert knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this expert knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating graph limits, known as graphons, from observations of sequences of sparse finite graphs. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. This enables the use of results on graph limits of dense graphs to derive convergence. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. We demonstrate empirically that we can distinguish different numbers of stars (which are sparse) by the graphons of their corresponding line graphs. Whereas in the original graphs, the different number of stars all converge to the zero graphon due to sparsity. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
