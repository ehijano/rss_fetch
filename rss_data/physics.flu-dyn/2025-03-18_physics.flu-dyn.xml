      <title>Nanodroplet Dynamics: Coalescence and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the coalescence-induced jumping of water nanodroplets in a high Ohnesorge number regime (0.4 &lt; Oh &lt; 1) on a superhydrophobic surface and the dynamics of droplets when a stationary droplet on a solid surface is struck by another droplet of similar size from above, using molecular dynamics simulation. The first part of this study identified the critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates, developed a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a special phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches zero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference between droplets. These findings align well with prior micro-level studies and experimental predictions. The second part of this study investigated the jumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon a stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and wettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case. Scaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution coefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re) number. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts. For superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three times the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless spreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases, the jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for conversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation. For the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant at high-impact droplet velocities. About 1% of the energy is dissipated due to surface adhesion, which reduces at higher impact velocity.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Relaxation Time on Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability under Reshock Impact: A Two-Component Discrete Boltzmann Method Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability plays an important role in various natural and engineering fields, such as inertial confinement fusion. In this work, the effect of relaxation time on the RM instability under reshock impact is investigated by using a two-component discrete Boltzmann method. The hydrodynamic and thermodynamic characteristics of the fluid system are comprehensively analyzed from the perspectives of the density gradient, vorticity, kinetic energy, mixing degree, mixing width, and non-equilibrium intensity. Simulation results indicate that for larger relaxation time, the diffusion and dissipation are enhanced, the physical gradients decrease, and the growth of the interface is suppressed. Furthermore, the non-equilibrium manifestations show complex patterns, driven by the competitive physical mechanisms of the diffusion, dissipation, shock wave, rarefaction wave, transverse wave, and fluid instabilities. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanism of compressible fluid flows.</description>

      <title>An experimental study of using artificial reefs as scour protection around an offshore wind monopile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial reefs (ARs) are man-made structures deployed on the seabed to support benthic marine ecosystems. Their presence significantly damps the local flow and therefore can be used for scour protection of offshore wind monopiles. Although the concept appears feasible, the underlying flow-sediment process is very complex and has yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, a set of fixed-bed flume tests were conducted to reveal the hydrodynamic details of two typical AR shapes (cubic and hemisphere) tightly placed around a monopile in a 3x3 pattern. In parallel, a set of live-bed tests were conducted to demonstrate the AR's efficiency in scour protection. The cubic ARs almost eliminate the downward flow on the upstream side of the monopile and reduces the wake flow by 50-80%. The hemisphere ARs also significantly weaken the wake flow but guide descending flow in front of the monopile. While cubic ARs decrease upstream and downstream scour depth by up to 100%, their edge scour can lead to ARs displacement and hence reduce scour protection. The hemisphere ARs provided less scour reduction, but also less edge scour, making them more adaptive to morphology changes. Based on these findings, an optimized AR layout was proposed.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field simulations of dynamic wetting by the Volume-Of-Fluid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a toy model for dynamic contact lines using the Volume-of-Fluid method, designed to match Phase-Field results at a lower computational cost. We use a theoretical relation to model the mass diffusion at the contact line through a simple relation for the contact angle. In practice, the computational boundary is lifted a specific distance away from the wall where we apply a Navier boundary condition coupled with a dynamic apparent contact angle that accounts for the curvature of the interface. The comparison of the model results with respect to the full Phase-Field ones, on two different setups with the same input parameters, demonstrates the robustness of the model. This offers a practical and efficient alternative to solve contact line problems at lower cost.</description>

      <title>Fluid mechanics of sarcomeres as porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by sarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and thin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Integral modelling and Reinforcement Learning control of 3D liquid metal coating on a moving substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic coatings are used to improve the durability of metal surfaces, protecting them from corrosion. These protective layers are typically deposited in a fluid state via a liquid film. Controlling instabilities in the liquid film is crucial for achieving uniform and high-quality coatings. This study explores the possibility of controlling liquid films on a moving substrate using a combination of gas jets and electromagnetic actuators. To model the 3D liquid film, we extend existing integral models to incorporate the effects of electromagnetic actuators. The control strategy was developed within a reinforcement learning framework, where the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm interacts with the liquid film via pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators to optimize a reward function, accounting for the amplitude of the instability waves through a trial and error process. The PPO found an optimal control law, which successfully reduced interface instabilities through a novel control mechanism, where gas jets push crests and electromagnets raise troughs using the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>C(NN)FD -- Deep Learning Modelling of Multi-Stage Axial Compressors Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning and its applications to numerical analyses such as CFD has recently experienced a surge in interest. While its viability has been demonstrated in different domains, it has not yet reached a level of robustness and scalability to make it practical for industrial applications in the turbomachinery field. The highly complex, turbulent, and three-dimensional flows of multi-stage axial compressors for gas turbine applications represent a remarkably challenging case. This is due to the high-dimensionality of the regression of the flow-field from geometrical and operational variables, and the high computational cost associated with the large scale of the CFD domains. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a generalized deep learning framework for predictions of the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors, also potentially applicable to any type of turbomachinery. A physics-based dimensionality reduction unlocks the potential for flow-field predictions for large-scale domains, re-formulating the regression problem from an unstructured to a structured one. The relevant physical equations are used to define a multi-dimensional physical loss function. Compared to "black-box" approaches, the proposed framework has the advantage of physically explainable predictions of overall performance, as the corresponding aerodynamic drivers can be identified on a 0D/1D/2D/3D level. An iterative architecture is employed, improving the accuracy of the predictions, as well as estimating the associated uncertainty. The model is trained on a series of dataset including manufacturing and build variations, different geometries, compressor designs and operating conditions. This demonstrates the capability to predict the flow-field and the overall performance in a generalizable manner, with accuracy comparable to the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Improving the quasi-biennial oscillation via a surrogate-accelerated multi-objective optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the QBO remains a formidable challenge partly due to uncertainties in representing convectively generated gravity waves. We develop an end-to-end uncertainty quantification workflow that calibrates these gravity wave processes in E3SM to yield a more realistic QBO. Central to our approach is a domain knowledge-informed, compressed representation of high-dimensional spatio-temporal wind fields. By employing a parsimonious statistical model that learns the fundamental frequency of the underlying stochastic process from complex observations, we extract a concise set of interpretable and physically meaningful quantities of interest capturing key attributes, such as oscillation amplitude and period. Building on this, we train a probabilistic surrogate model. Leveraging the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, our surrogate efficiently represents these characteristics as a set of orthogonal features, thereby capturing the cross-correlations among multiple physics quantities evaluated at different stratospheric pressure levels, and enabling rapid surrogate-based inference at a fraction of the computational cost of inference reliant only on full-scale simulations. Finally, we analyze the inverse problem using a multi-objective approach. Our study reveals a tension between amplitude and period that constrains the QBO representation, precluding a single optimal solution that simultaneously satisfies both objectives. To navigate this challenge, we quantify the bi-criteria trade-off and generate a representative set of Pareto optimal physics parameter values that balance the conflicting objectives. This integrated workflow not only improves the fidelity of QBO simulations but also advances toward a practical framework for tuning modes of variability and quasi-periodic phenomena, offering a versatile template for uncertainty quantification in complex geophysical models.</description>

      <title>Jamming of Elastoviscoplastic fluids in Elastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid flows are driven by a non-trivial interplay between the elastic, viscous, and plastic properties, which under certain conditions can transition the otherwise laminar flow into complex flow instabilities with rich space-time-dependent dynamics. We discover that under elastic turbulence regimes, EVP fluids undergo dynamic jamming triggered by localised polymer stress deformations that facilitate the formation of solid regions trapped in local low-stress energy wells. Below the jamming transition $\phi&lt;\phi_J$, the solid volume fraction $\phi$ scales with $\sqrt{Bi}$, where $Bi$ is the Bingham number characterizing the ratio of yield to viscous stresses, in direct agreement with theoretical approximations based on the laminar solution. The onset of this new dynamic jamming transition $\phi\geq\phi_J$ is marked by a clear deviation from the scaling $\phi \sim \sqrt{Bi}$, scaling as $\phi \sim \exp{Bi}$. We show that this instability-induced jamming transition -- analogous to that in dense suspensions -- leads to slow, minimally diffusive, and rigid-like flows with finite deformability, highlighting a novel phase-change in elastic turbulence regimes of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Rods in flows: the PDE theory of immersed elastic filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of curve evolution equations approximating the motion of a Kirchhoff rod immersed in a low Reynolds number fluid. The rod is modeled as a framed curve whose energy consists of the bending energy of the curve and the twisting energy of the frame. The equations we consider may be realized as gradient flows of the rod energy under a certain anisotropic metric coming from resistive force theory. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a comprehensive treatment of the PDE theory of immersed rod dynamics. We begin by analyzing the problem without the frame, in which case the evolution is globally well-posed and solutions asymptotically converge to Euler elasticae. Next, in the planar setting, we demonstrate the existence of large time-periodic solutions forced by intrinsic curvature relevant to undulatory swimming. Finally, the majority of the paper is devoted to the evolution of an immersed Kirchhoff rod in 3D, which involves a strong coupling between the curve and frame. Under a physically reasonable assumption on the curvature, solutions exist globally-in-time and asymptotically converge to rod equilibria.</description>

      <title>Temporal large-scale intermittency and its impact on the statistics of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows in three dimensions are characterized by the transport of energy from large to small scales through the energy cascade. Since the small scales are the result of the nonlinear dynamics across the scales, they are often thought of as universal and independent of the large scales. However, as famously remarked by Landau, sufficiently slow variations of the large scales should nonetheless be expected to impact small-scale statistics. Such variations, often termed large-scale intermittency, are pervasive in experiments and even in simulations, while differing from flow to flow. Here, we evaluate the impact of temporal large-scale fluctuations on velocity, vorticity, and acceleration statistics by introducing controlled sinusoidal variations of the energy injection rate into direct numerical simulations of turbulence. We find that slow variations can have a strong impact on flow statistics, raising the flatness of the considered quantities. We discern three contributions to the increased flatness, which we model by superpositions of statistically stationary flows. Overall, our work demonstrates how large-scale intermittency needs to be taken into account in order to ensure comparability of statistical results in turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Applications of deep learning to physical simulations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics have recently experienced a surge in interest, and their viability has been demonstrated in different domains. However, due to the highly complex, turbulent, and three-dimensional flows, they have not yet been proven usable for turbomachinery applications. Multistage axial compressors for gas turbine applications represent a remarkably challenging case, due to the high-dimensionality of the regression of the flow field from geometrical and operational variables. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a deep learning framework for predictions of the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multistage axial compressors. A physics-based dimensionality reduction approach unlocks the potential for flow-field predictions, as it re-formulates the regression problem from an unstructured to a structured one, as well as reducing the number of degrees of freedom. Compared to traditional "black-box" surrogate models, it provides explainability to the predictions of the overall performance by identifying the corresponding aerodynamic drivers. The model is applied to manufacturing and build variations, as the associated performance scatter is known to have a significant impact on $CO_2$ emissions, which poses a challenge of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application. The deployed model is readily integrated within the manufacturing and build process of gas turbines, thus providing the opportunity to analytically assess the impact on performance with actionable and explainable data.</description>
