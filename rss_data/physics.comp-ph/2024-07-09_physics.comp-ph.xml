      <title>Limit theorems for the neutron transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, ingenuous developments in Monte Carlo methods have enabled the unbiased estimation of adjoint-weighted reactor parameters expressed as bilinear forms, such as kinetics parameters and sensitivity coefficients. A prominent example is the Iterated Fission Probability method, which relies on the simulation of the fission chains descending from an ancestor neutron: the neutron population at an asymptotic fission generation yields an estimate of the importance function (and hence of the adjoint fundamental eigenmode) at the phase-space coordinates of the ancestor neutron. In this paper we first establish rigorous results concerning the moments of the asymptotic neutron population stemming from a single initial particle, with special focus on the average and the variance. Then, we propose a simple benchmark configuration where exact solutions are derived for these moments, which can be used for the verification of new functionalities of production Monte Carlo codes involving the Iterated Fission Probability method.</description>

      <title>Fast and spectrally accurate construction of adaptive diagonal basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we combine the periodic sinc basis set with a curvilinear coordinate system for electronic structure calculations. This extension allows for variable resolution across the computational domain, with higher resolution close to the nuclei and lower resolution in the inter-atomic regions. We address two key challenges that arise while using basis sets obtained by such a coordinate transformation. First, we use pseudospectral methods to evaluate the integrals needed to construct the Hamiltonian in this basis. Second, we demonstrate how to construct an appropriate coordinate transformation by solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation using a new approach that we call the cyclic Knothe-Rosenblatt flow. The solution of both of these challenges enables mean-field calculations at a cost that is log-linear in the number of basis functions. We demonstrate that our method approaches the complete basis set limit faster than basis sets with uniform resolution. We also emphasize how these basis sets satisfy the diagonal approximation, which is shown to be a consequence of the pseudospectral method. The diagonal approximation is highly desirable for the solution of the electronic structure problem in many frameworks, including mean field theories, tensor network methods, quantum computing, and quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>TPDH-Graphene as a New Anodic Material for Lithium Ion Battery: DFT-Based Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal graphene (TPDH-gr), a recently proposed 2D carbon allotrope as an anodic material in lithium ion batteries (LIB), was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Li-atom adsorption is moderate (around 0.70 eV), allowing for easy desorption. Moreover, energy barrier, diffusion coefficient, and open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations show rapid Li atom diffusion on the TPDH-gr surface, stable intercalation of lithium atoms, and good performance during the charge and discharge cycles of the LIB. These findings, combined with the intrinsic metallic nature of TPDH-gr, indicate that this new 2D carbon allotrope is a promising candidate for use as an anodic LIB material.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation formulation for transient electromagnetic transmission problems on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <title>Unveiling nonmagnetic phase and many-body entanglement in two-dimensional random quantum magnets Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a random-plaquette $J_1$-$J_2$ model on the square lattice to capture the physics of a series of spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet compounds Sr$_2$CuTe$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$. With the input of experimentally relevant coupling strengths, our exact diagonalization (ED) study probes the ground state properties beyond previous linear spin-wave approach. An intermediate range of $x \in [0.08, 0.55]$ is identified for a nonmagnetic phase without the long-range N\'eel or stripe order. The absence of both valence-bond-glass order and spin-glass non-ergodic dynamics renders its nature intriguing. Deep inside this phase around $x = 0.3$, we observe signatures potentially linked to randomness-induced short-range spin-liquid-like (SLL) states, including close to zero spin-freezing parameter, vanishing spin-spin correlation beyond nearest neighbors, almost uniform static spin structure factor, as well as a broad tail in the dynamical spin structure factor. The nonmagnetic phase also features multipartite entanglement in the ground state witnessed by quantum Fisher information (QFI), which exhibits universal scaling behaviors at quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Competing nucleation pathways in nanocrystal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts from numerical approaches to complement experimental measurements, several fundamental challenges have still hindered one's ability to truly provide an atomistic picture of the nucleation process in nanocrystals. Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1) Machine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture the finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven characterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape associated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a large range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling. Altogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide crystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that different nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of supercooling.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin glasses guided by neural network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

      <title>Time-domain topology optimization of power dissipation in dispersive dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a density-based topology optimization scheme for locally optimizing the electric power dissipation in nanostructures made of lossy dispersive materials. By using the complex-conjugate pole-residue (CCPR) model, we can accurately model any linear materials' dispersion without limiting to specific material classes. We incorporate the CCPR model via auxiliary differential equations (ADE) into Maxwell's equations in the time domain, and formulate a gradient-based topology optimization problem to optimize the dissipation over a broad spectrum of frequencies. To estimate the objective function gradient, we use the adjoint field method, and explain the discretization and integration of the adjoint system into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. Our method is demonstrated using the example of topology optimized spherical nanoparticles made of Gold and Silicon with an enhanced absorption efficiency in the visible-ultraviolet spectral range. In this context, a detailed analysis of the challenges of topology optimization of plasmonic materials associated with a density-based approach is given.</description>

      <title>Changes in Dislocation Punching Behavior Due to Hydrogen-Seeded Helium Bubble Growth in Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of gas atoms in tungsten is a topic of long-standing interest to the plasma-facing materials community due the metal's use as a divertor material in some tokamak fusion reactors. The nucleation and growth of He/H gas bubbles (along with their isotopes) can result from impinging fluxes of these gases which give rise to damage at the W divertor surface. The inclusion of He or H in W has been studied extensively by the community, finding that He bubbles modify the surface through periodic dislocation punching and bursting mechanisms while H bubbles impact the metal through plastic-strain induced material failure. However, the mechanisms which are present during the combined flux of both He and H is not well-studied atomistically. Motivated by this, an atomistic modeling study is conducted using molecular dynamics to assess the behavior of mixed concentration He:H bubbles in W. We find that the introduction of H into a growing He bubble results in a dramatic change in the nature and presence of dislocation loops which are typically generated via dislocation punching in over-pressurized He bubbles. Most notably, at high H concentrations, there is a switchover in energetic favorability from glissile 1/2$&lt;$111$&gt;$ dislocations to sessile $&lt;$100$&gt;$ dislocations. This thermodynamic crossover could imply a significant reduction in W surface morphology changes than with pure He bubbles and, additionally, we show this to have implications on the trapping of H in the bubbles and their associated dislocations.</description>

Abstract: The study of percolation phenomena has various applications ranging from social networks or materials science to quantum information. The most common percolation models are bond- or site-percolation for which the Newman-Ziff algorithm enables an efficient simulation. Here, we consider several non-standard percolation models that appear in the context of measurement-based photonic quantum computing with so-called graph states and fusion networks. The associated percolation thresholds determine the tolerance to photon loss in such systems and we develop modifications of the Newman-Ziff algorithm to perform the corresponding percolation simulation efficiently. We demonstrate our algorithms by using them to characterize exemplary fusion networks and graph states. The used source code is provided as an open-source repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in quantum computing technology lead to an increasing need for software simulators that enable both algorithm design and the validation of results obtained from quantum hardware. This includes calculations that aim at probing regimes of quantum advantage, where a quantum computer outperforms a classical computer in the same task. High performance computing (HPC) platforms play a crucial role as today's quantum devices already reach beyond the limits of what powerful workstations can model, but a systematic evaluation of the individual performance of the many offered simulation packages is lacking so far. In this Technical Review, we benchmark several software packages capable of simulating quantum dynamics with a special focus on HPC capabilities. We develop a containerized toolchain for benchmarking a large set of simulation packages on a local HPC cluster using different parallelisation capabilities, and compare the performance and system size-scaling for three paradigmatic quantum computing tasks. Our results can help finding the right package for a given simulation task and lay the foundation for a systematic community effort to benchmark and validate upcoming versions of existing and also newly developed simulation packages.</description>

      <title>Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) near air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. The results support a stable ionic double-layer distribution near the interface for both air-water and oil-water interface systems. Hydronium tends to reside in the topmost layer of the interface, while hydroxide with a slightly stronger interfacial stabilization free energy is enriched in the deeper interfacial layer. This double-layer distribution may help to understand the longstanding controversy about the interfacial acid-base nature.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing global analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations not only mirror the original function as accurately as desired, but are purposefully created to possess features that the original function lacks. This is particularly useful for functions that lack closed form and are defined by integrals or infinite series. Replacing these definitions with simple analytical expressions enables in-depth qualitative analysis and replaces the current methods of evaluation. We demonstrate this procedure by providing replacements for a variety of pivotal functions in physics and cosmology including the pressure and density of quantum gas, the one-loop correction in thermal field theory, common polylog functions, and the error function.</description>

      <title>Designing Superionic Conductors Using Tetrahedrally Packed Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advanced energy storage solutions, the crystal structure of ionic conductors plays a pivotal role in facilitating ion transport. The conventional structural design principle that compounds with the body-centered cubic (BCC) anionic frameworks have high ionic conductivity is well known. We have extended the conventional design principle by uncovering that many of the anionic frameworks of Ag-ion conductors are characterized by tetrahedrally packed (TP) structures. Leveraging our findings, we have virtually screened TP framework compounds, uncovering their intrinsic potential for superior ionic conductivity through first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our design principle is applicable to Ag$^+$ and other mobile ions, including Li$^+$ and F$^-$. We proposed the Met2Ion method to generate ionic crystal structures using metal crystal structures as templates and demonstrated that new ionic conductors with TP frameworks can be discovered. This work paves the way for the discovery and development of next-generation energy storage materials with enhanced performance.</description>
