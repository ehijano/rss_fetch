      <title>Review and Novel Formulae for Transmittance and Reflectance of Wedged Thin Films on absorbing Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically, spectroscopic techniques have been essential for studying the optical properties of thin solid films. However, existing formulae for both normal transmission and reflection spectroscopy often rely on simplified theoretical assumptions, which may not accurately align with real-world conditions. For instance, it is common to assume (1) that the thin solid layers are deposited on completely transparent thick substrates and (2) that the film surface forms a specular plane with a relatively small wedge angle. While recent studies have addressed these assumptions separately, this work presents an integrated framework that eliminates both assumptions simultaneously. In addition, the current work presents a deep review of various formulae from the literature, each with their corresponding levels of complexity. Our review analysis highlights a critical trade-off between computational complexity and expression accuracy, where the newly developed formulae offer enhanced accuracy at the expense of increased computational time. Our user-friendly code, which includes several classical transmittance and reflectance formulae from the literature and our newly proposed expressions, is publicly available in both Python and Matlab at this link.</description>

      <title>Defect Landscape Engineering to Tune Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Systems in FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising architecture for next-generation, low energy spintronic devices uses skyrmions -- nanoscale whirlpools of magnetic moment -- as information carriers. Notably, schemes for racetrack memory have been proposed in which skyrmions and antiskyrmions, their antiparticle, serve as the logical bits 1 and 0. However, major challenges exist to designing skyrmion-antiskyrmion based computing. The presence of both particles in one material is often mutually exclusive such that few systems have been identified in which they coexist, and in these systems their appearance is stochastic rather than deterministic. Here, we create a tunable skyrmion-antiskyrmion system in FeGe films through ion-irradiation and annealing, and detail the structural properties of the films under these various conditions. Specifically, we irradiate epitaxial B20-phase FeGe films with 2.8 MeV Au$^{4+}$ ions, showing evidence that the amorphized regions preferentially host antiskyrmions at densities controlled by the irradiation fluence. In this work, we focus on a subsequent, systematic electron diffraction study with in-situ annealing, demonstrating the ability to recrystallize controllable fractions of the material at temperatures ranging from approximately 150$^{\circ}$ C to 250$^{\circ}$ C, enabling further tunability of skyrmion/antiskyrmion populations. We describe the crystallization kinetics using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, finding that growth of crystalline grains is consistent with diffusion-controlled one-to-two dimensional growth with a decreasing nucleation rate. The procedures developed here can be applied towards creation of skyrmion-antiskyrmion systems for energy-efficient, high-density data storage, spin wave emission produced by skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair annihilation, and more generally testbeds for research on skyrmion-antiskyrmion liquids and crystals.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity, Magnetoelectricity, and Piezoelectricity in Two-Dimensional Janus VSBrI Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials that combine intrinsic ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity exhibit significant potential for applications in highly integrated magnetoelectric and multifunctional spintronic devices. Through first-principles calculations, we identify the Janus VSBrI monolayer as a promising multiferroic semiconductor material, possessing both ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. Specifically, the VSBrI monolayer shows a large in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE) of 460 $\mu$eV/V, a significant intrinsic in-plane spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of 1.20 $\times$ $10^{-10}$ C/m, and a high energy barrier between two ferroelectric states of 168 eV. Our findings reveal that the energy variances among different magnetic states notably correlate with polarization, hinting at the potential for sizable magnetoelectric coupling within the VSBrI. Interestingly, we find that the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. The calculated in-plane piezoelectric coefficient d$_{11}$ reaches 29.01 pm/V and the out-plane piezoelectric coefficient d$_{32}$ reaches 1.60 pm/V, both of which are significantly larger than those of most known 2D materials, which is greatly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer a promising candidate for 2D multifunctional spintronic devices, with significant potential to advance next-generation technology and inform the design of related electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Saturable absorption in highly excited silicon and its suppression at the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electronic excitation in laser-irradiated silicon at finite electron temperatures is numerically investigated by first-principles calculations based on the time-dependent density functional theory. In bulk silicon at finite temperatures under near-infrared laser irradiation, we found that the absorbed energy is saturated when using a certain laser intensity even with a few-cycle pulse. Although one-photon processes of conduction-to-conduction and valence-to-valence transitions are dominant at such a laser intensity, the Pauli blocking inhibits further one-photon transition. With higher intensities, multi-photon excitation across the bandgap overwhelms the one-photon excitation and the saturable absorption disappears. At the surface of finite-temperature silicon, the Pauli blocking is suppressed by the symmetry breaking and the absorbed energy is relatively enhanced from the energy of the saturable absorption in the bulk region.</description>

      <title>Interlayer coupling rotatable magnetic easy-axis in MnSe2 mono- and bi-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in tuning the electronic structures and magnetic ground states of two-dimensional materials, influenced by the number of layers, interlayer distance, and stacking order. However, its effect on the orientation of the magnetic easy axis remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that interlayer coupling can significantly alter the magnetic easy-axis orientation, as shown by the magnetic easy-axis of monolayer 1T-MnSe2 tilting 33{\deg} from the z-axis, while aligning with the z-axis in the bilayer. This change results from variations in orbital occupations near the Fermi level, particularly involving nonmetallic Se atoms. Contrary to the traditional focus on magnetic metal atoms, our findings reveal that Se orbitals play a key role in influencing the easy-axis orientation and topological Chern numbers. Furthermore, we show that the occupation of Se p-orbitals, and consequently the magnetic anisotropy, can be modulated by factors such as stacking order, charge doping, and external strain. Our results highlight the pivotal role of interlayer coupling in tuning the magnetic properties of layered materials, with important implications for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Weak-field FMR and magnetization near the collinear to conical ferrimagnetic phase transition in the U-type hexaferrite Sr4CoZnFe36O60 ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and its interference with other microwave (MW) magnons near the collinear to conical ferrimagnetic phase transition at Tc2 = 305 K is found to correlate with the evolution of the weak-field magnetization: from two components in the conical phase to one component in the collinear phase. The FMR splitting above Tc2 correlates with the splitting of the coercive fields of the two magnetization components. A high sensitivity of the FMR to the weak magnetic bias near Tc2 is shown to be caused by the gradual transformation of the conical spin magnetic moments to the longitudinal ones. Application of the weak magnetic bias allows to adjust the MW absorption, and its level of above 30 dB is achieved near the FMR frequency (5.7 - 7.2 GHz), that allows to consider the Sr4CoZnFe36O60 hexaferrite ceramics as a possible MW absorbing material.</description>

      <title>Predicting Miscibility in Binary Compounds: A Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithm Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of data science and materials informatics has significantly propelled the advancement of multi-component compound synthesis research. This study employs atomic-level data to predict miscibility in binary compounds using machine learning, demonstrating the feasibility of such predictions. We have integrated experimental data from the Materials Project (MP) database and the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), covering 2,346 binary systems. We applied a random forest classification model to train the constructed dataset and analyze the key factors affecting the miscibility of binary systems and their significance while predicting binary systems with high synthetic potential. By employing advanced genetic algorithms on the Co-Eu system, we discovered three novel thermodynamically stable phases, CoEu8, Co3Eu2, and CoEu. This research offers valuable theoretical insights to guide experimental synthesis endeavors in binary and complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Creating a Microstructure Latent Space with Rich Material Information for Multiphase Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate microstructure serves as the cornerstone for the composition/processing-structure-property (CPSP) connection in multiphase alloys. Traditional alloy design methods often overlook microstructural details, which diminishes the reliability and effectiveness of the outcomes. This study introduces an improved alloy design algorithm that integrates authentic microstructural information to establish precise CPSP relationships. The approach utilizes a deep-learning framework based on a variational autoencoder to map real microstructural data to a latent space, enabling the prediction of composition, processing steps, and material properties from the latent space vector. By integrating this deep learning model with a specific sampling strategy in the latent space, a novel, microstructure-centered algorithm for multiphase alloy design is developed. This algorithm is demonstrated through the design of a unified dual-phase steel, and the results are assessed at three performance levels. Moreover, an exploration into the latent vector space of the model highlights its seamless interpolation ability and its rich material information content. Notably, the current configuration of the latent space is particularly advantageous for alloy design, offering an exhaustive representation of microstructure, composition, processing, and property variations essential for multiphase alloys.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in an intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of novel opportunities covering various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest important additions to the growing list of materials due to its unique triple-Q (3Q) ground state possessing topological characteristics. Careful bulk characterisations have shown the ground state of CoxTaS2 to be a rare 3Q tetrahedral structure for x less than 1/3. The uniqueness of this ground state arises from the dense real-space Berry curvature due to scalar spin chirality, giving rise to a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate that we can control this topological phase via gating. Using three kinds of CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we have established that we can cover the whole 3Q topological phase with ionic gating. This work reports a rare demonstration of electrical gating control of layered antiferromagnetic metal. More importantly, our work constitutes one of the first examples of the electrical control of the scalar spin chirality using antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>Molecular spin-probe sensing of H-mediated changes in Co nanomagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of hydrogen on magnetization is of significant interest to spintronics. Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, particularly in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we utilized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90$^{\circ}$ rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. \textit{Ab initio} calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicate that this effect is limited. Our study provides valuable microscopic insights into the chemical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Doping-Induced Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution at MoS2 Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate theory and DFT calculations of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 with Co, Ni and Pt impurities show the significance of dihydrogen (H2*) complex where both hydrogen atoms are interacting with the surface. Stabilization of such a complex affects the competing Volmer-Heyrovsky (direct H2 release) and Volmer-Tafel (H2* intermediate) pathways. The resulting evolution proceeds with a very small overpotential for all dopants ($\eta$ = 0.1 to 0.2 V) at 25% edge substitution, significantly reduced from the already low $\eta$ = 0.27 V for the undoped edge. At full edge substitution, Co-MoS2 remains highly active ($\eta$ = 0.18 V) while Ni- and Pt-MoS2 are deactivated ($\eta$ = 0.4 to 0.5 V) due to unfavorable interaction with H2*. Instead of the single S-vacancy, the site of intrinsic activity in the basal plane was found to be the undercoordinated central Mo-atom in threefold S-vacancy configurations, enabling hydrogen evolution with $\eta$ = 0.52 V via a H2* intermediate. The impurity atoms interact favorably with the intrinsic sulfur vacancies on the basal plane, stabilizing but simultaneously deactivating the triple vacancy configuration. The calculated shifts in overpotential are consistent with reported measurements, and the dependence on doping level may explain variations in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Microstructural features and hydrogen diffusion in bcc FeCr alloys: a comparison between the Kelvin probe- and nanohardness based- methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement can result in a sudden failure in metallic materials, which is particularly harmful in industrially relevant alloys, such as steels. A more comprehensive understanding of hydrogen interactions with microstructural features is critical for preventing hydrogen-induced damage and promoting a hydrogen-based environment-benign economy. We use the Kelvin probe-based potentiometric hydrogen electrode method and thermal desorption spectroscopy to investigate hydrogen interactions with different hydrogen traps in ferritic FeCr alloys with different chromium contents, dislocation densities, and grain sizes. In addition, we confirm the validity of a novel nanohardness-based diffusion coefficient approach by performing in situ nanoindentation testing. Simultaneous acquisition of the dynamic time-resolved mechanical response of FeCr alloys to hydrogen and the hydrogen diffusivities in these alloys is possible during continuous hydrogen supply. Dislocations, grain boundaries and Cr atoms induce reversible hydrogen trapping sites in these ferritic alloys, leading to the reduction of the hydrogen diffusion coefficients and the increase of the absorbed hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinear Rashba effect and spin Hall conductivity in Janus MXenes W2COX (X = S, Se, Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) facilitates spin manipulation without relying on an external magnetic field, opening up exciting possibilities for advanced spintronic devices. In this work, we examine the effects of crystal momentum ($k$) nonlinearity and anisotropy on the conventional Rashba effect, with a particular focus on their impact on the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) in a newly predicted family of 2D Janus materials, W$_2$COX (X = S, Se, Te). Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we confirm the dynamical and mechanical stability of the studied 2D materials. Strikingly, this materials family exhibits pronounced nonlinear Rashba spin splitting at the $\Gamma$ point of Brillouin zone near the Fermi level, which cannot be adequately described by the linear-$k$ Rashba model. Therefore, third-order momentum contributions ({$k^3$}) must be incorporated into the Rashba Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals that among the studied systems, W$_2$COS exhibits the highest {$k^3$} contribution of $-45.9$\,eV\,{\AA$^3$}, despite having the lowest linear Rashba constant. A detailed analysis of electronic structure reveals topological nontrivial behaviour in these 2D materials, yielding sizable SHC that is primarily governed by the nonlinear Rashba effect. Notably, these materials also exhibit large spin Hall angle (0.018 -- 2.5), which is comparable to that of in bulk topological insulators like Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, and surpassing those in narrow bandgap bulk semiconductors GeTe and SnTe, as well as heavy metals such as Pt. Sizable SHC, large spin Hall angles, and the ability to tune SHC via electric fields without altering the topological properties, rooted in the crystal field splitting, underscore the potential of these materials for spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Metallic nanoclusters are of interest in many fields because of their size-dependent catalytic activity. This activity can, in part, be influenced by their melting properties. In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster sizes induced strong variations in melting point ($T_{melt}$), latent heat of melting ($\Delta H_{melt}$), and onset temperature of isomerization ($T_{iso}$). Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into 3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and far-from-closed-shell clusters. First-order-like phase transitions were observed only for cluster sizes with particularly symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells with up to a few missing or extra atoms. Near-closed-shell clusters had very low $T_{iso}$ relative to their $T_{melt}$. Far-from-closed-shell clusters exhibited second-order-like phase transitions. Variations in the melting and isomerization behavior of neighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Tunable Targets for Light Dark Matter Direct Detection: The Case of Solid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose hydrostatic pressure -- a well-established tool for tuning properties of condensed matter -- as a novel route for optimizing targets for light dark matter direct detection, specifically via phonons. Pressure dramatically affects compressible solids by boosting the speed of sound and phonon frequencies. Focusing on helium -- the most compressible solid -- our ab initio calculations illustrate how high pressure elevates helium from lacking single-phonon reach to rivaling leading candidates. Our work establishes pressure as an unexplored tuning knob for accessing lower dark matter mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Multipath Signal-Selective Metasurface: Passive Time-Varying Interlocking Mechanism to Vary Spatial Impedance for Signals with the Same Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) multipath interference is difficult to address with passive approaches due to two physical restrictions - the shared frequency of the initial and interfering signals and their variable incident angles. Thus, to address multipath interference, the spatial impedance must be adjusted in response to the incident angles of multiple signals with the same frequency, which is impossible with classic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We present a design concept for metasurface-based spatial filters to overcome LTI behavior and suppress multipath interference signals using a time-varying interlocking mechanism without any active biasing systems. The proposed devices are coupled to the first incoming wave to adjust the spatial impedance and suppress delayed waves in the time domain, which is validated numerically and experimentally. This study opens a new avenue for passive yet time-varying selective EM metasystems, enabling the adjustment of spatially complicated EM waves and fields even at the same frequency.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity at a gallium-mercury liquid metal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermoelectric effect at the interface between two liquid metals. Using superimposed layers of mercury and gallium in a cylindrical vessel operating at room temperature, we provide a direct measurement of the electric current generated by the presence of a thermal gradient along a liquid-liquid interface. At the interface between two liquids, temperature gradients induced by thermal convection lead to a complex geometry of electric currents, ultimately generating current densities near boundaries that are significantly higher than those observed in conventional solid-state thermoelectricity. When a magnetic field is applied to the experiment, an azimuthal shear flow, exhibiting opposite circulation in each layer, is generated. Depending on the value of the magnetic field, two different flow regimes are identified, in good agreement with a model based on the spatial distribution of thermoelectric currents, which has no equivalent in solid systems. Finally, we discuss various applications of this new effect, such as the efficiency of liquid metal batteries.</description>

      <title>Fully-Polarized Topological Isostatic Metamaterials in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological surface states are unique to topological materials and are immune to disturbances. In isostatic lattices, mechanical topological floppy modes exhibit softness depending on the polarization relative to the terminating surface. However, in three dimensions, the polarization of topological floppy modes is disrupted by the ubiquitous mechanical Weyl lines. Here, we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases free of Weyl lines. Floppy modes emerge exclusively on a particular surface of the three-dimensional isostatic structure, leading to the strongly asymmetric stiffness between opposing boundaries. Additionally, uniform soft strains can reversibly shift the lattice configuration to Weyl phases, reducing the stiffness contrast to a trivially comparable level. Our work demonstrates the fully-polarized topological mechanical phases in three dimensions, and paves the way towards engineering soft and adaptive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Cutting Mechanics of Soft Compressible Solids: Force-radius scaling versus bulk modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting mechanics in soft solids present a complex mechanical challenge due to the intricate behavior of soft ductile materials as they undergo crack nucleation and propagation. Recent research has explored the relationship between the cutting force needed to continuously cut a soft material and the radius of the wire (blade). A typical simplifying assumption is that of material incompressibility, albeit no material in nature is really incompressible. In this study, we relax this assumption and examine how material (in)compressibility influences the correlation between cutting forces and material properties like toughness and modulus. The ratio {\mu}/\k{appa}, where {\mu} and \k{appa} are the shear and bulk moduli, indicates the material's degree of compressibility, where incompressible materials have {\mu}/\k{appa}=0, and larger {\mu}/\k{appa} provide higher volumetric compressibility. Following previous observations, we obtain two cutting regimes: (i) high toughness or small wire radius, and (ii) low toughness or large wire radius. Regime (i) is dominated by frictional dissipation, while regime (ii) is dominated by adhesive debonding and/or the wear resistance of the material. These regimes are controlled by the ratio between the wire radius and the elasto-cohesive length of the material: the critical crack opening displacement at fast fracture under uniaxial tension. In the large radius, regime (ii), our theoretical findings reveal that incompressible materials require larger forces. Notably, however, the elasto-cohesive length of the material, defining the transition wire radius between regimes (i) and (ii), is larger for compressible materials, which are therefore more likely to be cut in regime (i), and thus requiring larger cutting forces.</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chains. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming it is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point separating two T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. The lack of magnetic order above 0.3 K results from these quantum critical fluctuations, potentially compounded by Kondo moment compensation. Ti4MnBi2 provides the first experimental evidence that 1D magnetism, previously the exclusive domain of insulators, persists in metallic systems with moderate correlations.</description>

      <title>Self-intercalation as origin of high-temperature ferromagnetism in epitaxially grown Fe5GeTe2 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17439v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of self-intercalation in 2D van der Waals materials is key to the understanding of many of their properties. Here we show that the magnetic ordering temperature of thin films of the 2D ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 is substantially increased by self-intercalated Fe that resides in the van der Waals gaps. The epitaxial films were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and their magnetic properties explored by element-specific x-ray magnetic circular dichroism that showed ferromagnetic ordering up to 375 K. Both surface and bulk sensitive x-ray absorption modes were used to confirm that the magnetic signal is of an intrinsic nature. Fe occupation within the van der Waals gap was determined by x-ray diffraction which showed a notably higher occupation with respect to bulk crystals. We thus infer, supported by first-principles calculations, that the higher magnetic ordering temperature results from an increased exchange interaction between the individual Fe5GeTe2 layers mediated by Fe atoms residing within the van der Waals gaps. Our findings establish self-intercalation during epitaxial growth as an efficient mechanism to achieve high-temperature magnetism in a broad class of van der Waals materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulator is a fertile platform to study the interplay between magnetism and topology. The unique electronic band structure can induce exotic transport and optical properties. However, a comprehensive optical study in both near-infrared frequency and terahertz frequency has been lacking. Here, we report magneto-optical effects from a heterostructure of Cr-incorporated topological insulator, CBST. We use 800 nm magneto-optical Kerr effect to reveal a ferromagnetic order in the CBST film with a high transition temperature at 160 K. We also use time-domain terahertz polarimetry to reveal a terahertz Faraday rotation of 1.5 mrad and Kerr rotation of 5.1 mrad at 2 K. The calculated terahertz Hall conductance is 0.42 $e^2/h$. Our work shows the optical responses of an artificially layered magnetic topological insulator, paving the way towards high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect via heterostructure engineering.</description>

      <title>Effect of helium bubbles on the mobility of edge dislocations in copper</title>

Abstract: Helium bubbles can form in materials upon exposure to irradiation. It is well known that the presence of helium bubbles can cause changes in the mechanical behavior of materials. To improve the lifetime of nuclear components, it is important to understand deformation mechanisms in helium-containing materials. In this work, we investigate the interactions between edge dislocations and helium bubbles in copper using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We focus on the effect of helium bubble pressure (equivalently, the helium-to-vacancy ratio) on the obstacle strength of helium bubbles and their interaction with dislocations. Our simulations predict significant differences in the interaction mechanisms as a function of helium bubble pressure. Specifically, bubbles with high internal pressure are found to exhibit weaker obstacle strength as compared to low-pressure bubbles of the same size due to the formation of super-jogs in the dislocation. Activation energies and rate constants extracted from the MD data confirm this transition in mechanism and enable upscaling of these phenomena to higher length-scale models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling atomic structures is significant for the relationship construction between microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, we still lack a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabeled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental conditions, realizing simultaneous achievement of high quality and large volumes of the training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals (vdWs) interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (ReS2, ReSe2, and MoS2) with different layer numbers (bilayer and trilayers) and demonstrates robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moir\'e patterns that are undistinguishable in frequency domains. The high-throughput processing ability of our method helps discover a novel vdW epitaxy where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist, demonstrating the machine learning contribution to the new knowledge emergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pH response of liquid metal (eutectic GaInSn) in the form of a pendant drop is investigated and the sensitivity of 92.96 mV in the pH range from 4 to 10 is obtained. Unlike the fundamental limit of pH sensitivity of 59.1 mV in an electrolyte-site binding surface, the super-Nernstian pH sensitivity originated from a spontaneous electrochemical reaction associated with an enhanced ionic exchange at the ultra-thin (1-3 nm) Ga2O3-electrolyte interface which is purely driven by thermodynamics, rendering to the lowest system energy possible involving gallate and bi-gallate ions. A unified Nernst equation is derived by introducing an ion-exchange factor x to explain superNernstian pH sensitivity and found a direct link between pH sensitivity and Pourbaix pH-Potential formulations. It is found that Nernstian sensitivity of 59.1 mV occurs only for symmetric ion exchange (x=1) reaction, whereas asymmetric ion exchanges could result in sensitivity far beyond the Nernst sensitivity. Our findings have great scientific significance, which could redefine the conventional concept of the ion sensing mechanism in a solid-state electrochemical sensor and push forward the future development of the 2D oxide-based electrochemical sensor.</description>

      <title>Direct and indirect spin current generation and spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques in ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet trilayers are studied using a combination of symmetry analysis, circuit theory, semiclassical simulations, and first-principles calculations using the non-equilibrium Green's function method with supercell disorder averaging. We focus on unconventional processes involving the interplay between the two ferromagnetic layers, which are classified into direct and indirect mechanisms. The direct mechanism involves spin current generation by one ferromagnetic layer and its subsequent absorption by the other. In the indirect mechanism, the in-plane spin-polarized current from one ferromagnetic layer ``leaks'' into the other layer, where it is converted into an out-of-plane spin current and reabsorbed by the original layer. The direct mechanism results in a predominantly dampinglike torque, which damps the magnetization towards a certain direction $\mathbf{s}_d$. The indirect mechanism results in a predominantly fieldlike torque with respect to a generally different direction $\mathbf{s}_f$. Similar to the current-in-plane giant magnetoresistance, the indirect mechanism is only active if the thickness of the nonmagnetic spacer is smaller than or comparable to the mean-free path. Numerical calculations for a semiclassical model based on the Boltzmann equation confirm the presence of both direct and indirect mechanisms of spin current generation. First-principles calculations reveal sizeable unconventional spin-orbit torques in Co/Cu/Co, Py/Cu/Py, and Co/Pt/Co trilayers and provide strong evidence of indirect spin current generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect of light beams reflected from the surfaces of various two-dimensional hexagonal crystalline structures, considering their associated time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ and inversion $\mathcal{I}$ symmetries, is investigated. Employing the Haldane model with tunable parameters as a generic model, we examine the longitudinal and transverse spin-separations of the reflected beam in both topological non-trivial and trivial systems. The study reveals that the sign switching of the PSHE in these materials is attributed to the non-trivial and trivial topology. By manipulating the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and external electric fields, we demonstrate topological phase transitions in buckled Xene monolayer materials through the photonic spin Hall effect. Different behaviors of the photonic spin Hall effect are observed in various topological phases within these materials. Additionally, we explore the reflected spin and valley-polarized spatial shifts in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The photonic spin Hall effect in buckled Xene monolayer materials and transition metal dichalcogenides is highly influenced by the spin and valley degrees of freedom of charge carriers, offering a promising avenue to explore spintronics and valleytronics in these hexagonal materials. We propose that the photonic spin Hall effect in Haldane materials can serve as a metrological tool for optical parameter characterization and as a promising method for determining Chern numbers and topological phase transitions through direct optical weak measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic anomalous Hall effect emerging from electronic correlations</title>

Abstract: While altermagnetic materials are characterized by a vanishing net magnetic moment, their symmetry in principle allows for the existence of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Here we introduce a model with altermagnetism in which the emergence of an AHE is driven by interactions. This model is grounded in a modified Kane-Mele framework with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations show that the system undergoes a finite temperature phase transition governed by a primary AFM order parameter accompanied by a secondary one of Haldane type. The emergence of both orders turns the metallic state of the system, away from half-filling, to an altermagnet with a finite anomalous Hall conductivity. A mean field ansatz corroborates these results, which pave the way into the study of correlation induced altermagnets with finite Berry curvature.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models. Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs from roughly 41 days to less than one second. We apply explanation algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are commonly found in various materials, such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides and spin density waves (skyrmion crystals) in B20 compounds. Compared to single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves possess an additional internal degree of freedom-a phase shift arising from the phase of the order parameters, in addition to the translations of the density waves. In this study, we systematically investigate the significant effects stemming from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular emphasis on potential phase shifts. We demonstrate that these phase shifts play a crucial role in influencing the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial at the hot spots, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Hedin's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>
