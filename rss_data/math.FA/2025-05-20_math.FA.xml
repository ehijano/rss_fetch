      <title>Spectral Asymptotics for Quantized Derivatives on Quantum Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain spectral asymptotics for the quantized derivatives of elements from the first-order homogeneous Sobolev space on the quantum Euclidean space, extending an earlier result of McDonald, Sukochev and Xiong (Commun. Math. Phys. 2020). Our approach is based on a noncommutative Wiener-Ikehara Tauberian theorem and a recently developed $C^\ast$-algebraic version of pseudo-differential operator theory.</description>

      <title>On the Boundedness of Hypersingular Integrals Along Certain Radial Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of oscillatory hypersingular integral operators associated to a radial hypersurface of the form $\Gamma(t)=(t,\varphi(t)), t\in\R{n}$. When $\varphi$ satisfies suitable curvature and monotonicity conditions, we prove $L^p(\R{{n+1}})$ boundedness of the operator, where the range of $p$ depends on the hypersingularity of the operator. We also establish certain Sobolev estimates of the operator under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the best approximation and distance problems in the operator space $\B(\HS)$ and in the space of trace class operators $\LS^1(\B(\HS))$. Formulations of distances are obtained in both cases. The case of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras is also considered. The computational advantage of the results is illustrated through examples.</description>

      <title>On singularity of $p$-energy measures on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, we prove that for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, under the volume doubling condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality both with $p$-walk dimension strictly larger than $p$ implies the singularity of the associated $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure. We also prove that under the slow volume regular condition, the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the resistance estimate. As a direct corollary, on a large family of fractals and metric measure spaces, including the Sierpi\'nski gasket and the Sierpi\'nski carpet, we obtain the singularity of the $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure for all $p$ strictly great than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension.</description>

      <title>Fourier Multipliers on Quasi-Banach Orlicz Spaces and Orlicz Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that if a Fourier multiplier is continuous from $L^{\Phi_1}$ to $L^{\Phi_2}$, then it is also continuous from $M^{\Phi_1,\Psi}$ to $M^{\Phi_2,\Psi}$, where $\Phi_1,\Phi_2,\Psi$ are quasi-Young functions and $\Phi_1$ fulfills the $\Delta_2$-condition. This result is applied to show that Mihlin's Fourier multiplier theorem and H\"ormander's improvement hold in certain Orlicz modulation spaces. Lastly, we show that the Fourier multiplier with symbol $m(\xi) = e^{i \mu(\xi)}$, where $\mu$ is homogeneous of order $\alpha$, is bounded on quasi-Banach Orlicz modulation spaces of order $r$, assuming $r\in\big(d/(d+2),1\big]$ and $\alpha\in\big(d(1-r)/r, 2\big]$.</description>

      <title>On the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$ denote the space of $n\times m$ real matrices, and $\mathcal{K}_o^{n,m}$ be the set of convex bodies in $M_{n, m}(\mathbb{R})$ containing the origin. We develop a theory for the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity $C_{p,Q}(\cdot)$ for $p\in[1,n)$ and $Q\in\mathcal{K}_{o}^{1,m}$. Several equivalent definitions for the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity will be provided, and some of its fundamental properties will be proved, including for example, translation invariance and affine invariance. We also establish several inequalities related to the $m$th order $p$-affine capacity, including those comparing to the $p$-variational capacity, the volume, the $m$th order $p$-integral affine surface area, as well as the $L_p$ surface area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a growth bound for the operator norm of $C_0$-semigroups on Hilbert spaces under a corresponding growth bound on the resolvent of the semigroup generator. For some super-linear resolvent growths, our estimate is sharper than the ones currently available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Schur property and measures of weak non-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare several versions of the quantitative Schur property of Banach spaces. We establish their equivalence up to multiplicative constants and provide examples clarifying when the change of constants is necessary. We also give exact results on preservation of the quantitative Schur property by finite or infinite direct sums. We further prove a sufficient condition for the $1$-Schur property which simplifies and generalizes previous results.
  We study in more detail relationship of the quantitative Schur property to quantitative weak sequential completeness and to equivalence of measures of weak non-compactness. We also illustrate the difference of real and complex settings. To this end we prove and use the optimal version of complex quantiative Rosenthal $\ell_1$-theorem. Finally, we give two examples of Lipschitz-free spaces over countable graphs which have quantitative Schur property, but not the $1$-Schur property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an asymptotic formula for the supremum of the resolvent norm ($\zeta$ -T ) -1 over |$\zeta$| $\ge$ 1 and contractions T acting on an n-dimensional Hilbert space, whose spectral radius does not exceed a given r $\in$ (0, 1). We prove that this supremum is achieved on the unit circle by an analytic Toeplitz matrix.</description>

      <title>Classification of ill-posedness for bounded linear operators in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, concepts of well- and ill-posedness for linear operators in Hilbert and Banach spaces are discussed. While these concepts are well understood in Hilbert spaces, this is not the case in Banach spaces, as there are several competing definitions, related to the occurrence of uncomplemented subspaces. We provide an overview of the various definitions and, based on this, discuss the classification of type I and type II ill-posedness in Banach spaces. Furthermore, a discussion of borderline (hybrid) cases in this classification is given together with several example instances of operators.</description>

      <title>Relations between different types of Hypoellipticity: A systematic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a systematic treatment to the concept of hypoellipticity, putting it into an abstract form which allows us to deal with several different notions within the same framework. We then investigate when a notion of hypoellipticity implies another one and, in particular, when it can be extended for more general spaces. We also present a relation between certain types of hypoellipticity and local solvability (for the transpose) for a family of operators.</description>

      <title>Speeding up quantum Markov processes through lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of non-reversible lifts for reversible diffusion processes initiated by Eberle and Lorler (2024) to quantum Markov dynamics. The lifting operation, which naturally results in hypocoercive processes, can be formally interpreted as, though not restricted to, the reverse of the overdamped limit. We prove that the $L^2$ convergence rate of the lifted process is bounded above by the square root of the spectral gap of its overdamped dynamics, indicating that the lifting approach can at most achieve a transition from diffusive to ballistic mixing speeds. Further, using the variational hypocoercivity framework based on space-time Poincare inequalities, we derive a lower bound for the convergence rate of the lifted dynamics. These findings not only offer quantitative convergence guarantees for hypocoercive quantum Markov processes but also characterize the potential and limitations of accelerating the convergence through lifting. In addition, we develop an abstract lifting framework in the Hilbert space setting applicable to any symmetric contraction $C_0$-semigroup, thereby unifying the treatment of classical and quantum dynamics. As applications, we construct optimal lifts for various detailed balanced classical and quantum processes, including the symmetric random walk on a chain, the depolarizing semigroup, Schur multipliers, and quantum Markov semigroups on group von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete classification of \(\mathrm{SL}(n)\) contravariant, \(p\)-order tensor valuations on convex polytopes in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) for \( n \geq p \) is established without imposing additional assumptions, particularly omitting any symmetry requirements on the tensors. Beyond recovering known symmetric tensor valuations, our classification reveals asymmetric counterparts associated with the cross tensor and the Levi-Civita tensor. Additionally, some Minkowski type relations for these asymmetric tensor valuations are obtained, extending the classical Minkowski relation of surface area measures.</description>

      <title>Restriction for Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a transference principle, asserting that every restriction estimate satisfied by the Fourier transform in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is likewise valid for the propagator of certain Schr\"odinger equations. We consider smooth Hamiltonians with an at most quadratic growth, and also a class of nonsmooth Hamiltonians, encompassing potentials that are Fourier transforms of complex (finite) measures. Roughly speaking, if the initial datum belongs to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for $p$ in a suitable range of exponents, the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ (for each fixed $t$, with the exception of certain particular values) can be meaningfully restricted to compact curved submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The underlying property responsible for this phenomenon is the boundedness $L^p\to(\mathcal{F}L^p)_{\rm loc}$, with $1\leq p\leq2$, of the propagator, which is derived from almost diagonalization and dispersive estimates in certain function spaces defined in terms of wave packet decompositions in phase space.</description>

      <title>Limit-case admissibility for positive infinite-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of positive infinite-dimensional linear systems, we systematically study $L^p$-admissible control and observation operators with respect to the limit-cases $p=\infty$ and $p=1$, respectively. This requires an in-depth understanding of the order structure on the extrapolation space $X_{-1}$, which we provide. These properties of $X_{-1}$ also enable us to discuss when zero-class admissibility is automatic. While those limit-cases are the weakest form of admissibility on the $L^p$-scale, it is remarkable that they sometimes follow from order theoretic and geometric assumptions. Our assumptions on the geometries of the involved spaces are minimal.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for order continuous Banach lattices with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ is a topological space and $S(X)$ is the vector lattice of all equivalence classes of real-valued continuous functions on open dense subsets of $X$. Although, $S(X)$ is not a normed lattice, we can have unbounded norm topology ($un$-topology) on it. On the other hand, the recent result, due to Wickstead, presents a representation approach for every Archimedean vector lattice $E$ in terms of $S(X)$-spaces. In this paper, we show that this representation is order continuous and when $E$ is order complete, it coincides with the known Maeda-Ogasawara representation. Moreover, we obtain a similar representation for an order continuous Banach lattice in terms of $S(X)$-spaces that is a $un$-homeomorphism. Furthermore, as an application, we establish a representation approach for the Fremlin projective tensor product between Banach lattices, in terms of $S(X)$-spaces, as well.</description>

      <title>Continuous functions on limits of F-decomposable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of F-decomposable systems, well-ordered inverse systems of Hausdorff compacta with fully closed bonding mappings. A continuous mapping between Hausdorff compacta is called fully closed if the intersection of the images of any two closed disjoint subsets is finite. We give a characterization of such systems in terms of a property of the continuous functions on their limit. When, moreover, the fibers of neighboring bonding mappings are metrizable, we call the limit of such a system an F_d-compact, a particular case of a Fedorchuk compact. The stated property allows us to obtain a locally uniformly rotund renorming on the space C(K), where K is an F_d-compact of countable spectral height.</description>

      <title>Coarse Geometry of Free Products of Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a notion of the free product $X \ast Y$ of two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ has been introduced by T. Fukaya and T. Matsuka. In this paper, we study coarse geometric permanence properties of the free product $X \ast Y$. We show that if $X$ and $Y$ satisfy any of the following conditions, then $X \ast Y$ also satisfies that condition: (1) they are coarsely embeddable into a Hilbert space or a uniformly convex Banach space; (2) they have Yu's Property A; (3) they are hyperbolic spaces. These generalize the corresponding results for discrete groups to the case of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and norm of certain p-adic Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by introducing some parameters, we define and study certain $p$-adic Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya-type integral operators acting on $p$-adic weighted Lebesgue spaces. We completely characterize the boundedness of these operators in terms of the parameters. For some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for the operators. These results are not only a complement to some previous results but also an extension of existing ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>A simple criterion for essential self-adjointness of Weyl pseudodifferential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new criterion for the essential self-adjointness of pseudodifferential operators that does not involve ellipticity-type assumptions. For example, we show that self-adjointness holds in case the symbol is $C^{2d+3}$ with derivatives of order two and higher being uniformly bounded. These results also apply to hermitian operator-valued symbols on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which are important to applications in physics. Our method relies on a phase space differential calculus for quadratic forms on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, Calder\'on-Vaillancourt type theorems, and a recent self-adjointness result for Toeplitz operators on the Segal-Bargmann space.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman-layered Model with Universal Property Based on Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the transition of the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlying the model, we show its universality and generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations, which establish a new connection between Koopman operators and numerical linear algebra. We also empirically demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on eigenvalue estimation of multiple Koopman operators for nonautonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Radii of Euclidean sections of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Dvoretzky theorem asserts that every $N$-dimensional convex body admits central sections of dimension $d = \Omega(\log N)$, which is nearly spherical. For many instances of convex bodies, typically unit balls with respect to some norm, much better lower bounds on $d$ have been obtained, with most research focusing on such lower bounds and on the degree of approximation of the section by a $d$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In this note we concentrate on another parameter, namely the radius of the approximating ball. We focus on the case of the unit ball of the space $\ell_1^N$ (the so-called cross-polytope), which is relevant to various questions of interest in theoretical computer science. We will also survey other instances where similar questions for other normed spaces (most often $\ell_p$-spaces or their non-commutative analogues) were found relevant to problems in various areas of mathematics and its applications, and state some open problems. Finally, in view of the computer science ramifications, we will comment on the algorithmic aspects of finding nearly spherical sections.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via refinement equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D.Klarner on Erd\"os question about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>
