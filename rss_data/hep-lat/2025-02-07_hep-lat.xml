      <title>Reproducibility and Open Science in Lattice Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility and Open Science are increasingly discussed as essential aspects of the research process. While there are areas where the Lattice community has been ahead of the curve with respect to the broader research world in this space, including early adoption of open publications via the arXiv, and the introduction of the International Lattice Data Grid in the 2000s, there are other areas where lattice practitioners could benefit from practices already adopted in other disciplines. In this Contribution, we report the outcomes of a panel discussion on this topic at the Lattice 2024 conference; after a discussion on motivations for work in this space, and introductory discussions of the relevant experiences of the panelists, we provide summaries of answers to the questions posed by the audience in the panel.</description>

      <title>Spectral parameters of the $\rho$ resonance from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD investigation of the $\rho$ resonance using nine $N_f = 2 + 1$ Wilson-Clover ensembles with three lattice spacings and various pion masses ranging from $135$ to $320$ MeV. For each ensemble, a large number of finite volume energy levels are determined and the energy dependence of the phase shift obtained from L\"uscher's finite volume method. The mass and width of the $\rho$ resonance are then extracted by assuming the Breit-Wigner form. The mass and width are extrapolated to the physical pion mass and continuum limit ($\mathcal{O}(a^2)$) using a linear function of $a^2$ and $m^2_\pi$. The extrapolated values for the mass and width in the Breit-Wigner form are $(m_\rho,\,\Gamma_\rho) = (781.6\pm10.0,\, 146.5\pm 9.9)$ MeV, which are in good agreement with experiment. An alternative method of analysis, based on Hamiltonian effective field theory, involves directly fitting the lattice energy levels and accounting for the quark mass dependence of the hadronic loop diagrams which yield the leading and next-to-leading non-analytic behaviour. This approach also yields consistent $\rho$ parameters at the physical point. This represents the most precise determination to date of the mass and width of a hadron which is unstable under strong decay, achieved through comprehensive lattice QCD calculations and methods of analysis.</description>

      <title>Computation of the latent heat of the deconfinement phase transition of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Yang-Mills theory across the deconfinement phase transition considering the framework of shifted boundary conditions in the temporal direction. By measuring the entropy density $s(T_c)/T_c^3$ on both sides of the phase transition at the critical temperature $T_c$, we can retrieve the latent heat $h$. Additionally, we compute $h$ from the discontinuity in the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor. Simulations are performed at five different values of the lattice spacing, allowing us to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. The two observables produce compatible results, giving the combined estimate $h = 1.175(10)$ in the continuum limit, achieving a precision of about 1 %. Moreover, we determine the critical temperature in physical units with permille accuracy, yielding $T_c \sqrt{t_0} = 0.24915(29)$. These results allow us to connect the confined and the deconfined phases with precision, and we present an improved computation of the Equation of State across the phase transition for temperatures between $0$ and $3.4 T_c$.</description>

      <title>NRQCD Bottomonium at non-zero temperature using time-derivative moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known challenge for the lattice community is calculating the spectral function from the Euclidean correlator. We have approximated the spectral function and derived the mass and thermal width of particles through the time derivatives of the lattice correlator moments. We have focused on extracting the properties of bottomonium states, specifically $\Upsilon$ and $\chi_{b1}$. We will give an overview of the time-derivative moments approach and present results for the temperature dependence of the mass and width of both bottomonium states. The zero temperature results are consistent with experimental values, while results at higher temperatures are similar to those obtained using other methods.</description>

      <title>Partially connected contributions to baryon masses in QCD+QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full QCD+QED simulations allow to evaluate isospin breaking corrections to hadron masses. With the openQxD code, we are able to perform these simulations employing C-periodic boundary conditions, implemented through a doubling of the physical lattice along one spatial direction. The use of these boundary conditions introduces non-zero Wick contractions between two quark or two antiquark fields, that, in the case of the computation of baryon masses, lead to partially connected additional contributions that we expect to vanish in the infinite volume limit. These contributions are challenging because they involve an all-to-all propagator connecting one point in the physical lattice and one in the mirror lattice. We present a way to compute these corrections to the $\Omega^-$ baryon mass using a combination of point and stochastic source inversions. This work is part of the program of the RC* collaboration.</description>

      <title>Absence of CP Violation in the Strong Interaction: Vacuum thwarts Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCD admits a contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which potentially gives rise to nontrivial phases and violates CP. This is essentially a question of how the vacuum reacts to the $\theta$ term. In this talk I will address the problem using new developments on the lattice. The overall solution is contrasted with the axion `solution'.</description>

      <title>Testing nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of the nucleation rate $\Gamma$ for first order phase transitions are important for determining their observable consequences in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used, but they are incomplete and should be tested against fully nonperturbative lattice simulations. We simulate nucleation on the lattice in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, a scenario which should be well described by perturbation theory. Our computation of the nucleation rate, however, only shows qualitative agreement with the perturbative result. This motivates further study of nucleation on the lattice and to higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>$D_1$ and $D_2$ resonances in coupled-channel scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin-1/2 charmed axial-vector $D^*\pi-D^*\eta-D^*_s\bar{K}$ scattering amplitudes are computed, along with interactions in several other $I=1/2$ $J^P$ channels. Using lattice QCD, we work at a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV, where the lowest three-hadron threshold ($D\pi\pi$) lies high enough to enable a rigorous treatment of this system considering only two-hadron scattering channels. At this light-quark mass, an axial-vector $D_1$ bound state is observed just below $D^*\pi$ threshold, that is strongly coupled to $D^*\pi$ in a relative $S$-wave and influences a wide energy region up to the $D^*\eta$ threshold. An axial-vector $D_1^\prime$ resonance is observed in the elastic $D^*\pi$ energy-region, which is coupled more strongly to $D$-wave $D^*\pi$. A single narrow tensor state is seen in $J^P=2^+$ coupled to both $D\pi$ and $D^*\pi$. In the region where $D^*\eta$ and $D^*_s\bar{K}$ are kinematically open, the available energy levels indicate significant $S$-wave interactions. Upon searching this region for poles, several possibilities exist with large uncertainties. One additional state consistently arises, predominantly coupled to the $S$-wave $D^*\pi-D^*\eta-D^*_s\bar{K}$ amplitudes around the upper energy limit of this analysis.</description>

      <title>The Equation of State of QCD up to very high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the non-perturbative computation of the entropy density in QCD for temperatures ranging from 3 GeV up to the electro-weak scale, using $N_f=3$ flavours of massless O$(a)$-improved Wilson fermions. We adopt a new strategy designed to be computationally efficient and based on formulating thermal QCD in a moving reference frame, where the fields satisfy shifted boundary conditions in the temporal direction and periodic boundary conditions along the spatial ones. In this setup the entropy density can be computed as the derivative of the free-energy density with respect to the shift parameter. For each physical temperature, we perform Monte Carlo simulations at four values of the lattice spacing in order to extrapolate the numerical data of the entropy density to the continuum limit. We achieve a final accuracy of approximatively $0.5$-$1.0\%$ and our results are compared with predictions from high-temperature perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Generic Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Kogut--Susskind Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies the understanding of mechanisms that avoid quantum thermalization in an isolated system quenched far from equilibrium. A prominent example is Hilbert space fragmentation, which has recently emerged as an ergodicity-breaking mechanism in constrained spin models. Here, we show that Kogut--Susskind formulations of lattice gauge theories in $d+1$D ($d$ spatial and one temporal dimensions) give rise to Hilbert space fragmentation, and discuss possible implications for understanding continuum physics. Our findings not only prove that lattice gauge theories are a natural platform for Hilbert space fragmentation, they also serve as a guide to the conditions under which these models can be faithfully used to infer the thermalization properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potentials has phenomenological relevance for a series of physical systems and provides an ideal testground for the modeling of dense strongly interacting matter. The two-flavor quark-meson model is known to effectively describe the condensation of charged pions in QCD that occurs in this setting. In this paper, we work out a renormalization-group invariant mean-field formulation of the model and demonstrate that the resulting phase diagram and equation of state is in quantitative agreement with data from lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Group Convolutional Networks for Sign Problem Mitigation via Contour Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sign problem that arises in Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations can be mitigated by deforming the integration manifold. While simple transformations are highly efficient for simulation, their efficacy systematically decreases with decreasing temperature and increasing interaction. Machine learning models have demonstrated the ability to push further, but require additional computational effort and upfront training. While neural networks possess the capacity to learn physical symmetries through proper training, there are anticipated advantages associated with encoding them into the network's structure. These include enhanced accuracy, accelerated training, and improved stability. The objective of the present study is twofold. First, we investigate the benefits of group convolutional models in comparison to fully connected networks, with a specific focus on the effects on the sign problem and on computational aspects. Second, we examine their capabilities for transfer learning, demonstrating the ability to further reduce training cost. We perform our investigations on the Hubbard model on select low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We extend our measurement of the equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD to small baryon and strangeness chemical potentials, using the leading order Taylor expansion coefficients computed directly at non-zero isospin chemical potentials. Extrapolating the fully connected contributions to vanishing pion sources is particularly challenging, which we overcome by using information from isospin chemical potential derivatives evaluated numerically. Using the Taylor coefficients, we present, amongst others, first results for the equation of state along the electric charge chemical potential axis, which is potentially of relevance for the evolution of the early Universe at large lepton flavour asymmetries.</description>
