      <title>Differentiable Programming for Computational Plasma Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable programming allows for derivatives of functions implemented via computer code to be calculated automatically. These derivatives are calculated using automatic differentiation (AD). This thesis explores two applications of differentiable programming to computational plasma physics. First, we consider how differentiable programming can be used to simplify and improve stellarator optimization. We introduce a stellarator coil design code (FOCUSADD) that uses gradient-based optimization to produce stellarator coils with finite build. Because we use reverse mode AD, which can compute gradients of scalar functions with the same computational complexity as the function, FOCUSADD is simple, flexible, and efficient. We then discuss two additional applications of AD in stellarator optimization. Second, we explore how machine learning (ML) can be used to improve or replace the numerical methods used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on time-dependent PDEs in fluid mechanics relevant to plasma physics. Differentiable programming allows neural networks and other techniques from ML to be embedded within numerical methods. This is a promising, but relatively new, research area. We focus on two basic questions. First, can we design ML-based PDE solvers that have the same guarantees of conservation, stability, and positivity that standard numerical methods do? The answer is yes; we introduce error-correcting algorithms that preserve invariants of time-dependent PDEs. Second, which types of ML-based solvers work best at solving PDEs? We perform a systematic review of the scientific literature on solving PDEs with ML. Unfortunately we discover two issues, weak baselines and reporting biases, that affect the interpretation reproducibility of a significant majority of published research. We conclude that using ML to solve PDEs is not as promising as we initially believed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Gaussian process tomography with imposed non-negativity constraints on physical quantities for plasma diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel tomographic method, nonlinear Gaussian process tomography (nonlinear GPT) that employs the Laplace approximation to ensure the non-negative physical quantity, such as the emissivity of plasma optical diagnostics. This new method implements a logarithmic Gaussian process (log-GP) to model plasma distribution more naturally, thereby expanding the limitations of standard GPT, which are restricted to linear problems and may yield non-physical negative values. The effectiveness of the proposed log-GP tomography is demonstrated through a case study using the Ring Trap 1 (RT-1) device, where log-GPT outperforms existing methods, standard GPT, and the Minimum Fisher Information (MFI) methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. The result highlights the effectiveness of nonlinear GPT for imposing physical constraints in applications to an inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Dynamics of Self-Consistent Collisionless Tearing Modes in Toroidal Gyrokinetic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tearing modes (TM) driven by current density gradient in collisionless tokamak plasmas by using the electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulation code ORB5. We elucidate the TM width by simulations for flat profiles, as the absence of background diamagnetic flows implies a small rotation-speed, while finite-gradients are included to investigate the TM rotation. For flat profiles, the initial saturation width of nonlinearly driven magnetic islands is related to the TM linear growth rate; however, large islands in the initial saturation phase are prone to current density redistribution that reduces the island width in the following evolution. Island-induced $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ and diamagnetic sheared flows develop at the separatrix, able to destabilize the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The KHI turbulence enhances a strong quadrupole vortex flow that reinforces the island decay, resulting in a strong reduction of the island width in an eventual steady state. This process is enhanced by trapped electrons. For finite gradients profile, the TM usually rotates in the electron diamagnetic direction, but can change direction when the ion temperature gradient dominates the other gradients. The reduced growth of the TM by diamagnetic effects results in a moderate island size, which remains almost unchanged after the initial saturation. At steady state, strong zonal flows are nonlinearly excited and dominate the island rotation, as expected from previous theoretical and numerical studies. When the plasma beta is increased, the TM mode is suppressed and a mode with the same helicity but with twisting parity, coupled with the neighboring poloidal harmonics, is destabilized, similar to the kinetic ballooning mode.</description>

      <title>Fast Plasma Frequency Sweep in Drude-like EM Scatterers via the Reduced-Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to use the Reduced-Basis Method (RBM) as a model order reduction approach to solve Maxwell's equations in electromagnetic (EM) scatterers based on plasma to build a metasurface, taking into account a parameter, namely, the plasma frequency. We build up the reduced-order model in an adaptive fashion following a greedy algorithm. This method enables a fast sweep over a wide range of plasma frequencies, thus providing an efficient way to characterize electromagnetic structures based on Drude-like plasma scatterers. We validate and test the proposed technique on several plasma metasurfaces and compare it with the finite element method (FEM) approach.</description>

      <title>Heating in the Solar Atmosphere at a Fin Current Sheet Driven by Magnetic Flux Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection before flux cancellation in the solar photosphere when two opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fragments are approaching one another is usually modelled by assuming that a small so-called "floating current sheet" forms about a null point or separator that is situated in the overlying atmosphere. Here instead we consider the reconnection that is initiated as soon as the fragments become close enough that their magnetic fields interact. The resulting current sheet, which we term a "fin sheet" extends up from the null point or separator that is initially located in the solar surface. We develop here nonlinear analyses for finite-length models of both fin and floating current sheets that extend the previous models that were limited to short floating current sheets. These enable the length of the current sheet to be calculated in both cases as functions of the separation distance of the sources and the reconnection rate, as well as the rate of heating. Usually, the fin current sheet liberates more energy than a floating current sheet.</description>

      <title>Advection-nonlinear-diffusion model of flare accelerated electron transport in Type III solar radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons accelerated by solar flares and observed as type III solar radio bursts are not only a crucial diagnostic tool for understanding electron transport in the inner heliosphere but also a possible early indication of potentially hazardous space weather events. The electron beams travelling in the solar corona and heliosphere along magnetic field lines generate Langmuir waves and quasilinearly relax towards a plateau in velocity space. The relaxation of the electron beam over the short distance in contrast to large beam-travel distances observed is often referred to as Sturrok's dilemma. Here, we develop a new electron transport model with quasilinear distance/time self-consistently changing in space and time. The model results in a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation for the electron beam density with nonlinear diffusion term that inversely proportional to the beam density. The solution predicts slow super-diffusive (ballistic) spatial expansion of a fast propagating electron beam. The model also provides the evolution of the spectral energy density of Langmuir waves, which determines brightness temperature of plasma radiation in solar bursts. The model solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulation using kinetic equations and can explain some characteristics of type III solar radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of divertor baffles on nitrogen-seeded detachment in TCV with SOLPS-ITER simulations and TCV experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma edge simulations with the SOLPS-ITER code are performed to study the influence of divertor baffles on nitrogen-seeded detachment in TCV single-null, L-mode discharges. Scans of nitrogen seeding rate are conducted in both baffled and unbaffled TCV divertors, where the nitrogen seeding with baffles is found to yield lower target temperatures and heat fluxes than with baffles-only and with seeding-only. The cumulative effects of baffles and seeding on target parameters are explained by the two-point model. The divertor neutral density and neutral compression increase with baffles, due to lower divertor to main chamber neutral conductance, as explained by a schematic neutral transport model with baffles. The nitrogen retention, defined as the ratio of average nitrogen nuclei density in divertor and main chamber, increases with the seeding rate if baffled, and remains constant if unbaffled. At the same outboard mid-plane separatrix plasma density, the nitrogen retention with baffles is lower than the unbaffled retention at low seeding levels and is higher at high seeding levels, which is explained by the changes of nitrogen ion and neutral transport with baffles and seeding. The baffled carbon retention is higher than the unbaffled retention due to lower divertor to main chamber carbon neutral conductance. Baffles increase the divertor radiation. The predicted trends of target parameters, the distribution of neutrals and radiations are well supported by TCV experiments, though discrepancies in the absolute values remain. The simulations yield an overall colder and denser divertor, consistent with previous SOLPS-ITER simulations of Ohmically heated L-modes in TCV. The successful comparison of simulation and experiment, together with the understanding gained from the neutral transport model, increases the confidence in the SOLPS simulations for the next TCV divertor upgrade.</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>
