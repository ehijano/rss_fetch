      <title>A novel method to separate circadian from non-circadian masking effects in order to enhance daily circadian timing and amplitude estimation from core body temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circadian disruption contributes to adverse effects on sleep, performance, and health. One accepted method to track continuous daily changes in circadian timing is to measure core body temperature (CBT), and establish daily, circadian-related CBT minimum time (Tmin). This method typically applies cosine-model fits to measured CBT data, which may not adequately account for substantial wake metabolic activity and sleep effects on CBT that confound and mask circadian effects, and thus estimates of the circadian-related Tmin. This study introduced a novel physiology-grounded analytic approach to separate circadian from non-circadian effects on CBT, which we compared against traditional cosine-based methods. The dataset comprised 33 healthy participants attending a 39-hour in-laboratory study with an initial overnight sleep followed by an extended wake period. CBT data were collected at 30-second intervals via ingestible capsules. Our design captured CBT during both the baseline sleep period and during extended wake period (without sleep) and allowed us to model the influence of circadian and non-circadian effects of sleep, wake, and activity on CBT using physiology-guided generalized additive models. Model fits and estimated Tmin inferred from extended wake without sleep were compared with traditional cosine-based models fits. Compared to the traditional cosine model, the new model exhibited superior fits to CBT (Pearson R 0.90 [95%CI; [0.83 - 0.96] versus 0.81 [0.55-0.93]). The difference between estimated vs measured circadian Tmin, derived from the day without sleep, was better fit with our method (0.2 [-0.5,0.3] hours) versus previous methods (1.4 [1.1 to 1.7] hours). This new method provides superior demasking of non-circadian influences compared to traditional cosine methods, including the removal of a sleep-related bias towards an earlier estimate of circadian Tmin.</description>

      <title>A reaction network model of microscale liquid-liquid phase separation reveals effects of spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins can form droplets via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells. Recent experiments demonstrate that LLPS is qualitatively different on two-dimensional (2d) surfaces compared to three-dimensional (3d) solutions. In this paper, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the causes of the discrepancies between LLPS in 2d versus 3d. We model the number of proteins and droplets inducing LLPS by continuous-time Markov chains and use chemical reaction network theory to analyze the model. To reflect the influence of space dimension, droplet formation and dissociation rates are determined using the first hitting times of diffusing proteins. We first show that our stochastic model reproduces the appropriate phase diagram and is consistent with the relevant thermodynamic constraints. After further analyzing the model, we find that it predicts that the space dimension induces qualitatively different features of LLPS which are consistent with recent experiments. While it has been claimed that the differences between 2d and 3d LLPS stems mainly from different diffusion coefficients, our analysis is independent of the diffusion coefficients of the proteins since we use the stationary model behavior. Therefore, our results give new hypotheses about how space dimension affects LLPS.</description>

      <title>Generating Binary Species Range Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the geographic ranges of species is crucial for assisting conservation efforts. Traditionally, range maps were manually created by experts. However, species distribution models (SDMs) and, more recently, deep learning-based variants offer a potential automated alternative. Deep learning-based SDMs generate a continuous probability representing the predicted presence of a species at a given location, which must be binarized by setting per-species thresholds to obtain binary range maps. However, selecting appropriate per-species thresholds to binarize these predictions is non-trivial as different species can require distinct thresholds. In this work, we evaluate different approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for binarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that require the generation of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that only require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing presence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed evaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range estimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we demonstrate improved performance over existing pseudo-absence free approaches using our method.</description>

      <title>Q-MRS: A Deep Learning Framework for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Spectra Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an established technique for studying tissue metabolism, particularly in central nervous system disorders. While powerful and versatile, MRS is often limited by challenges associated with data quality, processing, and quantification. Existing MRS quantification methods face difficulties in balancing model complexity and reproducibility during spectral modeling, often falling into the trap of either oversimplification or over-parameterization. To address these limitations, this study introduces a deep learning (DL) framework that employs transfer learning, in which the model is pre-trained on simulated datasets before it undergoes fine-tuning on in vivo data. The proposed framework showed promising performance when applied to the Philips dataset from the BIG GABA repository and represents an exciting advancement in MRS data analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Predict Late-Onset Breast Cancer Metastasis: the Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) Strategy for Meta Tuning Concerning Deep Feed-forward Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced in medicine, its widespread use in clinical applications, especially in predicting breast cancer metastasis, is still limited. We have been dedicated to constructing a DFNN model to predict breast cancer metastasis n years in advance. However, the challenge lies in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameter values through grid search, given the constraints of time and resources. Issues such as the infinite possibilities for continuous hyperparameters like l1 and l2, as well as the time-consuming and costly process, further complicate the task. To address these challenges, we developed Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) strategy, serving as a preselection method before grid search. Our experiments with SHGS applied to DFNN models for breast cancer metastasis prediction focus on analyzing eight target hyperparameters: epochs, batch size, dropout, L1, L2, learning rate, decay, and momentum. We created three figures, each depicting the experiment results obtained from three LSM-I-10-Plus-year datasets. These figures illustrate the relationship between model performance and the target hyperparameter values. For each hyperparameter, we analyzed whether changes in this hyperparameter would affect model performance, examined if there were specific patterns, and explored how to choose values for the particular hyperparameter. Our experimental findings reveal that the optimal value of a hyperparameter is not only dependent on the dataset but is also significantly influenced by the settings of other hyperparameters. Additionally, our experiments suggested some reduced range of values for a target hyperparameter, which may be helpful for low-budget grid search. This approach serves as a prior experience and foundation for subsequent use of grid search to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we obtain more than a hundred fold speedup relative to a leading ensemble MCMC approach that requires numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</description>
