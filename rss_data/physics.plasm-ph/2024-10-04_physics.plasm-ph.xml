      <title>Burn Propagation in Magnetized High-Yield Inertial Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) have demonstrated ignition for the first time in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiment, a major milestone allowing the possibility of high energy gain through burn propagation. Use of external magnetic fields, applied primarily to reduce thermal losses, could increase hotspot temperature and ease requirements for ignition, opening up the capsule design space for high energy gain. However, this same restriction of thermal transport has the potential to inhibit burn propagation, which is vital in the attainment of high gain. In this work, radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations carried out using the code Chimera are used to investigate the effect of a pre-imposed magnetic field on ignition and burn propagation. This paper studies the propagation of burn using both an idealized planar model and in fully-integrated 2D MHD simulations of an igniting NIF capsule. A study of magnetised burn propagation in the idealized planar model identifies three regimes of magnetized burn propagation: (1) thermal conduction driven; (2) alpha transport driven; and (3) fully suppressed burn. Simulations of NIF shot N210808 with an applied 40T axial field show clear indication of burn suppression perpendicular to field lines, with rapid burn observed along field lines. Implosion shape is altered by the field, and anisotropic conduction causes significant modification to the rate of ablation during stagnation. These results highlight the fundamental changes to implosion dynamics in high yield magnetized ICF and motivate further study to better optimize future magnetized target designs for high gain.</description>

      <title>Study of magnetic reconnection at low-$\beta$ using laser-powered capacitor coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous fundamental process in space and astrophysical plasmas that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles. Over the past decade, a new experimental platform has been developed to study magnetic reconnection using strong coil currents powered by high power lasers at low plasma beta, typical conditions under which reconnection is energetically important in astrophysics. KJ-class lasers were used to drive parallel currents to reconnect MG-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry, similar to the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment or MRX, and thus this platform is named micro-MRX. This presentation summarizes two major findings from micro-MRX: direct measurement of accelerated electrons and observation of ion acoustic waves during anti-parallel reconnection. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that direct acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Furthermore, a sudden onset of ion acoustic bursts has been measured by collective Thomson scattering in the exhaust of magnetic reconnection, followed by electron acoustic bursts with electron heating and bulk acceleration. These results demonstrate that the micro-MRX platform offers a novel and unique approach to study magnetic reconnection in the laboratory in addition to the capabilities provided by traditional magnetized plasma experiments such as MRX and the upcoming FLARE (Facility for Laboratory Reconnection experiments). Future approaches to study other particle acceleration mechanisms and ion acoustic waves from magnetic reconnection are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The non-perturbative adiabatic invariant is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbative guiding center theory adequately describes the slow drift motion of charged particles in the strongly-magnetized regime characteristic of thermal particle populations in various magnetic fusion devices. However, it breaks down for particles with large enough energy. We report on a data-driven method for learning a non-perturbative guiding center model from full-orbit particle simulation data. We show the data-driven model significantly outperforms traditional asymptotic theory in magnetization regimes appropriate for fusion-born $\alpha$-particles in stellarators, thus opening the door to non-perturbative guiding center calculations.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modelling of Stress and Heat Flux in Monoblock Divertors Using Machine Learning for Fusion Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of extreme heat loads in fusion reactors is critical to the integrity of plasma-facing components (PFCs). This study presents a real-time predictive framework for monoblock divertors, which are primarily composed of tungsten to manage thermal stress effectively. By combining finite element analysis (FEA) data with a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), our model predicts stress distribution, heat flux, and potential failure points. Our results indicate significant stress concentrations at thermal gradient points, with stress levels reaching up to 2000 MPa. The proposed framework facilitates data-driven design enhancements, proactive maintenance strategies, and improved operational safety as fusion reactors transition from experimental to commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially excited many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Ion-Acoustic Wave Dynamics in a Two-Fluid Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium containing free electrons and cations, where each particle group behaves as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The difference in roles electrons and ions play define the two-fluid description of plasma. This paper examines ion-acoustic waves generated by the particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless "Euler-Poisson" (EP) system. Employing phase-space asymptotic analysis, we establish that for specific wave speeds, EP acquires homoclinic orbits at the steady-state equilibrium and consequently, traveling waves. Combining python and Wolfram Mathematica, we captured visualizations of such behavior in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of tungsten influx rate using line emissions from W5+ ions in EAST Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S/XB ratios (ionization per emitted photon) allow one to relate spectroscopic emissivity measurements to the impurity influx from a localized source. In this work, we determine the tungsten influx by examining two dominant EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) line emissions at 282.13 \AA and 394.07 \AA, corresponding to the $4f 14 5f \rightarrow 4f 14 5d$ radiative transitions of the W$^{5+}$ ion. The ground configuration of W$^{5+}$ consists of the ground level and a metastable level, with the latter having a higher population than the ground state. Therefore, a simple approach assuming that the transitions are independent, i.e., only populated by a unique level source, requires correction. To address this, we have developed a fully collisional-radiative modeling in which 430 levels contribute to the ionization. We have utilized three advanced computational codes -- HULLAC (Hebrew University - Lawrence Livermore Atomic Code), AUTOSTRUCTURE, and FAC (Flexible Atomic Code) -- for the atomic structure calculations. These codes provide the necessary information such as wavelengths, collisional and radiative transition rate coefficients. The FAC code was also used to calculate the direct electron-impact ionization under the distorted-wave approximation. We also included contributions to total ionization from excitation-autoionization processes up to $n = 15$ manifolds from the distorted-wave calculations. Subsequently, we used these results to ascertain the tungsten impurity influx in a dedicated discharge of the EAST tokamak, which operates with full tungsten divertors. In our findings, we observed that for the density range relevant to the edge region of a tokamak reactor, the S/XB ratios are almost independent of electron density but exhibit significant variation with electron temperature.</description>

      <title>Green's function perspective on the nonlinear density response of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive equations of motion for higher order density response functions using the theory of thermodynamic Green's functions. We also derive expressions for the higher order generalized dielectric functions and polarization functions. Moreover, we relate higher order response functions and higher order collision integrals within the Martin-Schwinger hierarchy. We expect our results to be highly relevant to the study of a variety of quantum many-body systems such as matter under extreme temperatures, densities, and pressures.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Characterization of Intermittency in Plasma Turbulence: Single and Double Sheet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas remains an unresolved problem. The most poorly understood aspect is intermittency -- spatio-temporal fluctuations superimposed on the self-similar turbulent motions. We employ a novel machine-learning analysis technique to segment turbulent flow structures into distinct clusters based on statistical similarities across multiple physical features. We find that the previously identified intermittent fluctuations consist of two distinct clusters: i) current sheets, thin slabs of electric current between merging flux ropes, and; ii) double sheets, pairs of oppositely polarized current slabs, possibly generated by two non-linearly interacting Alfv\'en-wave packets. The distinction is crucial for the construction of realistic turbulence sub-grid models.</description>

      <title>A Tetrad-First Approach to Robust Numerical Algorithms in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Structure of the Guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell Equations with Polarization and Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian formulation of guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations, which contain dipole contributions to the guiding-center polarization and magnetization, is presented in terms of a guiding-center Hamiltonian functional that is derived from the exact guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell energy conservation law, and an antisymmetric functional bracket that satisfies the Jacobi property. Exact energy-momentum and angular momentum conservation laws are expressed in Hamiltonian form and the guiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell entropy functional is shown to be a Casimir functional.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>
