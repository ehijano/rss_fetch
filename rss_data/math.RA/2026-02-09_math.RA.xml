      <title>From cubic norm pairs to $G_2$- and $F_4$-graded groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Lie algebras arising from cubic norm pairs over arbitrary commutative base rings. Such Lie algebras admit a grading by a root system of type $G_2$, and when the cubic norm pair is a cubic Jordan matrix algebra, the $G_2$-grading can be further refined to an $F_4$-grading. We then use these Lie algebras and their gradings to construct corresponding root graded groups. Along the way, we produce many results providing detailed information about the structure of these Lie algebras and groups.</description>

      <title>Divide and Transfer: Non-Unique Factorizations Beyond Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unique factorization fails in many rings and monoids, but divisor and transfer homomorphisms provide tools to understand non-unique factorizations. In this expository article, we first explore these notions in the classical setting of commutative Dedekind domains, where monoids of zero-sum sequences appear as a natural combinatorial model. We then adapt these ideas to the setting of noncommutative Dedekind prime rings using module-theoretic methods. Going a step further, we discuss Rump and Yang's recent divisor theory for ideals in hereditary noetherian prime rings, where divisors can be visualized in a diagrammatic calculus.</description>

      <title>Essential Dimension of Central Simple Algebras when the Characteristic is Bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey of the existing literature, the state of the art, and a few minor new results and open questions regarding the essential dimension of central simple algebras and finite sequences of such algebras over fields whose characteristic divides the degree of the algebras under discussion. Upper and lower bounds as well as a few precise evaluations of this dimension are included.</description>

      <title>Quillen equivalence for chain homotopy categories induced by balanced pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a balanced pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ in an abelian category, we investigate when the chain homotopy categories ${\bf K}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}(\mathcal{Y})$ are triangulated equivalent. To this end, we realize these chain homotopy categories as homotopy categories of certain model categories and give conditions that ensure the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the model categories in question. We further give applications to cotorsion triples, Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules, as well as pure projective and pure injective objects.</description>

      <title>Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Ringel's contributions to quasi-hereditary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-hereditary algebras were introduced by Cline, Parshall and Scott to describe the highest weight categories of representations of semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups by the module categories of finite-dimensional algebras. Since then a lot of homological, structural and categorical properties of quasi-hereditary algebras have been discovered. This class of algebras seems quite common and occurs in many branches of mathematics. There are lots of important works on the subject. In this note we mainly survey some of Claus Michael Ringel's works or works jointly with his collaborators on quasi-hereditary algebras. Also, some of related works and recent developments on quasi-hereditary algebras are mentioned.</description>
