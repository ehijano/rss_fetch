      <title>Actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber threats are constantly evolving. Extracting actionable insights from unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data is essential to guide cybersecurity decisions. Increasingly, organizations like Microsoft, Trend Micro, and CrowdStrike are using generative AI to facilitate CTI extraction. This paper addresses the challenge of automating the extraction of actionable CTI using advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We explore the application of state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including the Llama 2 series, Mistral 7B Instruct, and Zephyr for extracting meaningful triples from CTI texts. Our methodology evaluates techniques such as prompt engineering, the guidance framework, and fine-tuning to optimize information extraction and structuring. The extracted data is then utilized to construct a KG, offering a structured and queryable representation of threat intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extracting relevant information, with guidance and fine-tuning showing superior performance over prompt engineering. However, while our methods prove effective in small-scale tests, applying LLMs to large-scale data for KG construction and Link Prediction presents ongoing challenges.</description>

      <title>Image-to-Text Logic Jailbreak: Your Imagination can Help You Do Anything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved remarkable success in generating comprehensive and nuanced responses, surpassing the capabilities of large language models. However, with the integration of visual inputs, new security concerns emerge, as malicious attackers can exploit multiple modalities to achieve their objectives. This has led to increasing attention on the vulnerabilities of VLMs to jailbreak. Most existing research focuses on generating adversarial images or nonsensical image collections to compromise these models. However, the challenge of leveraging meaningful images to produce targeted textual content using the VLMs' logical comprehension of images remains unexplored. In this paper, we explore the problem of logical jailbreak from meaningful images to text. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset designed to evaluate flowchart image jailbreak. Furthermore, we develop a framework for text-to-text jailbreak using VLMs. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of the framework on GPT-4o and GPT-4-vision-preview, with jailbreak rates of 92.8% and 70.0%, respectively. Our research reveals significant vulnerabilities in current VLMs concerning image-to-text jailbreak. These findings underscore the need for a deeper examination of the security flaws in VLMs before their practical deployment.</description>

      <title>A False Sense of Safety: Unsafe Information Leakage in 'Safe' AI Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaks$\unicode{x2013}$methods to elicit harmful or generally impermissible outputs. Safety measures are developed and assessed on their effectiveness at defending against jailbreak attacks, indicating a belief that safety is equivalent to robustness. We assert that current defense mechanisms, such as output filters and alignment fine-tuning, are, and will remain, fundamentally insufficient for ensuring model safety. These defenses fail to address risks arising from dual-intent queries and the ability to composite innocuous outputs to achieve harmful goals. To address this critical gap, we introduce an information-theoretic threat model called inferential adversaries who exploit impermissible information leakage from model outputs to achieve malicious goals. We distinguish these from commonly studied security adversaries who only seek to force victim models to generate specific impermissible outputs. We demonstrate the feasibility of automating inferential adversaries through question decomposition and response aggregation. To provide safety guarantees, we define an information censorship criterion for censorship mechanisms, bounding the leakage of impermissible information. We propose a defense mechanism which ensures this bound and reveal an intrinsic safety-utility trade-off. Our work provides the first theoretically grounded understanding of the requirements for releasing safe LLMs and the utility costs involved.</description>

      <title>Towards More Realistic Extraction Attacks: An Adversarial Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are prone to memorizing large parts of their training data, making them vulnerable to extraction attacks. Existing research on these attacks remains limited in scope, often studying isolated trends rather than the real-world interactions with these models. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective, exploiting the brittleness of language models. We find significant churn in extraction attack trends, i.e., even minor, unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and older checkpoints, can exacerbate the risks of extraction by up to $2-4 \times$. Moreover, relying solely on the widely accepted verbatim match underestimates the extent of extracted information, and we provide various alternatives to more accurately capture the true risks of extraction. We conclude our discussion with data deduplication, a commonly suggested mitigation strategy, and find that while it addresses some memorization concerns, it remains vulnerable to the same escalation of extraction risks against a real-world adversary. Our findings highlight the necessity of acknowledging an adversary's true capabilities to avoid underestimating extraction risks.</description>

      <title>Navigating Connected Car Cybersecurity: Location Anomaly Detection with RAN Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cybersecurity of connected cars, integral to the broader Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, has become of paramount concern. Cyber-attacks, including hijacking and spoofing, pose significant threats to these technological advancements, potentially leading to unauthorized control over vehicular networks or creating deceptive identities. Given the difficulty of deploying comprehensive defensive logic across all vehicles, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying potential attacks through Radio Access Network (RAN) event monitoring. The major contribution of this paper is a location anomaly detection module that identifies aberrant devices that appear in multiple locations simultaneously - a potential indicator of a hijacking attack. We demonstrate how RAN-event based location anomaly detection is effective in combating malicious activity targeting connected cars. Using RAN data generated by tens of millions of connected cars, we developed a fast and efficient method for identifying potential malicious or rogue devices. The implications of this research are far-reaching. By increasing the security of connected cars, we can enhance the safety of users, provide robust defenses for the automotive industry, and improve overall cybersecurity practices for IoT devices.</description>

      <title>STRIDE: Simple Type Recognition In Decompiled Executables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decompilers are widely used by security researchers and developers to reverse engineer executable code. While modern decompilers are adept at recovering instructions, control flow, and function boundaries, some useful information from the original source code, such as variable types and names, is lost during the compilation process. Our work aims to predict these variable types and names from the remaining information.
  We propose STRIDE, a lightweight technique that predicts variable names and types by matching sequences of decompiler tokens to those found in training data. We evaluate it on three benchmark datasets and find that STRIDE achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art machine learning models for both variable retyping and renaming while being much simpler and faster. We perform a detailed comparison with two recent SOTA transformer-based models in order to understand the specific factors that make our technique effective. We implemented STRIDE in fewer than 1000 lines of Python and have open-sourced it under a permissive license at https://github.com/hgarrereyn/STRIDE.</description>

      <title>Balancing Patient Privacy and Health Data Security: The Role of Compliance in Protected Health Information (PHI) Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protected Health Information (PHI) sharing significantly enhances patient care quality and coordination, contributing to more accurate diagnoses, efficient treatment plans, and a comprehensive understanding of patient history. Compliance with strict privacy and security policies, such as those required by laws like HIPAA, is critical to protect PHI. Blockchain technology, which offers a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger system, hold promise in policy compliance. This system ensures the authenticity and integrity of PHI while facilitating patient consent management. In this work, we propose a blockchain technology that integrates smart contracts to partially automate consent-related processes and ensuring that PHI access and sharing follow patient preferences and legal requirements.</description>

      <title>Safe Unlearning: A Surprisingly Effective and Generalizable Solution to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based approaches. Our extensive experiments confirmed our insight and suggested surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions \emph{without} any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B on \emph{out-of-distribution} (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts from 82.6\% to 7.7\%. This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9\% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution stems from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/SafeUnlearning}.</description>

      <title>A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Practical Black-box Adversarial Attacks for Evading Learning-based Windows Malware Detection in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the remarkable achievements of existing learning-based malware detection in both academia and industry, this paper presents MalGuise, a practical black-box adversarial attack framework that evaluates the security risks of existing learning-based Windows malware detection systems under the black-box setting. MalGuise first employs a novel semantics-preserving transformation of call-based redividing to concurrently manipulate both nodes and edges of malware's control-flow graph, making it less noticeable. By employing a Monte-Carlo-tree-search-based optimization, MalGuise then searches for an optimized sequence of call-based redividing transformations to apply to the input Windows malware for evasions. Finally, it reconstructs the adversarial malware file based on the optimized transformation sequence while adhering to Windows executable format constraints, thereby maintaining the same semantics as the original. MalGuise is systematically evaluated against three state-of-the-art learning-based Windows malware detection systems under the black-box setting. Evaluation results demonstrate that MalGuise achieves a remarkably high attack success rate, mostly exceeding 95%, with over 91% of the generated adversarial malware files maintaining the same semantics. Furthermore, MalGuise achieves up to a 74.97% attack success rate against five anti-virus products, highlighting potential tangible security concerns to real-world users.</description>

      <title>PII-Compass: Guiding LLM training data extraction prompts towards the target PII via grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PIII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.</description>

      <title>IncogniText: Privacy-enhancing Conditional Text Anonymization via LLM-based Private Attribute Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of text anonymization where the goal is to prevent adversaries from correctly inferring private attributes of the author, while keeping the text utility, i.e., meaning and semantics. We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90%. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model.</description>

      <title>ObfuscaTune: Obfuscated Offsite Fine-tuning and Inference of Proprietary LLMs on Private Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the timely yet underexplored problem of performing inference and finetuning of a proprietary LLM owned by a model provider entity on the confidential/private data of another data owner entity, in a way that ensures the confidentiality of both the model and the data. Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\"ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</description>

      <title>Zero-X: A Blockchain-Enabled Open-Set Federated Learning Framework for Zero-Day Attack Detection in IoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a crucial technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that integrates vehicles with the Internet and other entities. The emergence of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks presents an enormous potential to transform the IoV by enabling ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-bandwidth communications. Nevertheless, as connectivity expands, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. The issue has been further exacerbated by the rising number of zero-day (0-day) attacks, which can exploit unknown vulnerabilities and bypass existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we propose Zero-X, an innovative security framework that effectively detects both 0-day and N-day attacks. The framework achieves this by combining deep neural networks with Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Our approach introduces a novel scheme that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trusted and decentralized federated learning (FL) of the ZeroX framework. This scheme also prioritizes privacy preservation, enabling both CAVs and Security Operation Centers (SOCs) to contribute their unique knowledge while protecting the privacy of their sensitive data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage OSR in combination with privacy-preserving FL to identify both 0-day and N-day attacks in the realm of IoV. The in-depth experiments on two recent network traffic datasets show that the proposed framework achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate. Comparison with related work showed that the Zero-X framework outperforms existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Identification of Device Dependencies Using Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devices in computer networks cannot work without essential network services provided by a limited count of devices. Identification of device dependencies determines whether a pair of IP addresses is a dependency, i.e., the host with the first IP address is dependent on the second one. These dependencies cannot be identified manually in large and dynamically changing networks. Nevertheless, they are important due to possible unexpected failures, performance issues, and cascading effects. We address the identification of dependencies using a new approach based on graph-based machine learning. The approach belongs to link prediction based on a latent representation of the computer network's communication graph. It samples random walks over IP addresses that fulfill time conditions imposed on network dependencies. The constrained random walks are used by a neural network to construct IP address embedding, which is a space that contains IP addresses that often appear close together in the same communication chain (i.e., random walk). Dependency embedding is constructed by combining values for IP addresses from their embedding and used for training the resulting dependency classifier. We evaluated the approach using IP flow datasets from a controlled environment and university campus network that contain evidence about dependencies. Evaluation concerning the correctness and relationship to other approaches shows that the approach achieves acceptable performance. It can simultaneously consider all types of dependencies and is applicable for batch processing in operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Zero-Day Attack Detection in 5G and Beyond V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on top of 5G and Beyond networks (5GB) makes them vulnerable to increasing vectors of security and privacy attacks. In this context, a wide range of advanced machine/deep learning based solutions have been designed to accurately detect security attacks. Specifically, supervised learning techniques have been widely applied to train attack detection models. However, the main limitation of such solutions is their inability to detect attacks different from those seen during the training phase, or new attacks, also called zero-day attacks. Moreover, training the detection model requires significant data collection and labeling, which increases the communication overhead, and raises privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned limits, we propose in this paper a novel detection mechanism that leverages the ability of the deep auto-encoder method to detect attacks relying only on the benign network traffic pattern. Using federated learning, the proposed intrusion detection system can be trained with large and diverse benign network traffic, while preserving the CAVs privacy, and minimizing the communication overhead. The in-depth experiment on a recent network traffic dataset shows that the proposed system achieved a high detection rate while minimizing the false positive rate, and the detection delay.</description>

      <title>SOS! Soft Prompt Attack Against Open-Source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular among both the general public and industry, as they can be customized, fine-tuned, and freely used. However, some open-source LLMs require approval before usage, which has led to third parties publishing their own easily accessible versions. Similarly, third parties have been publishing fine-tuned or quantized variants of these LLMs. These versions are particularly appealing to users because of their ease of access and reduced computational resource demands. This trend has increased the risk of training time attacks, compromising the integrity and security of LLMs. In this work, we present a new training time attack, SOS, which is designed to be low in computational demand and does not require clean data or modification of the model weights, thereby maintaining the model's utility intact. The attack addresses security issues in various scenarios, including the backdoor attack, jailbreak attack, and prompt stealing attack. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective across all evaluated targets. Furthermore, we present the other side of our SOS technique, namely the copyright token -- a novel technique that enables users to mark their copyrighted content and prevent models from using it.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering utility: unveiling the limitations of synthetic mobility data generation algorithms in real-life scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of models for the generation of synthetic mobility data. These models aim to facilitate the sharing of data while safeguarding privacy, all while ensuring high utility and flexibility regarding potential applications. However, current utility evaluation methods fail to fully account for real-life requirements. We evaluate the utility of five state-of-the-art synthesis approaches, each with and without the incorporation of differential privacy (DP) guarantees, in terms of real-world applicability. Specifically, we focus on so-called trip data that encode fine granular urban movements such as GPS-tracked taxi rides. Such data prove particularly valuable for downstream tasks at the road network level. Thus, our initial step involves appropriately map matching the synthetic data and subsequently comparing the resulting trips with those generated by the routing algorithm implemented in OpenStreetMap, which serves as an efficient and privacy-friendly baseline. Out of the five evaluated models, one fails to produce data within reasonable computation time and another generates too many jumps to meet the requirements for map matching. The remaining three models succeed to a certain degree in maintaining spatial distribution, one even with DP guarantees. However, all models struggle to produce meaningful sequences of geo-locations with reasonable trip lengths and to model traffic flow at intersections accurately. It is important to note that trip data encompasses various relevant characteristics beyond spatial distribution, such as temporal information, all of which are discarded by these models. Consequently, our results imply that current synthesis models fall short in their promise of high utility and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-based Framework for Detecting Power Overloading Cyberattacks in Smart Grid AMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of the smart grid. It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Variables are a Curse in Software Vulnerability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches for software vulnerability prediction currently mainly rely on the original text of software code as the feature of nodes in the graph of code and thus could learn a representation that is only specific to the code text, rather than the representation that depicts the 'intrinsic' functionality of a program hidden in the text representation. One curse that causes this problem is an infinite number of possibilities to name a variable. In order to lift the curse, in this work we introduce a new type of edge called name dependence, a type of abstract syntax graph based on the name dependence, and an efficient node representation method named 3-property encoding scheme. These techniques will allow us to remove the concrete variable names from code, and facilitate deep learning models to learn the functionality of software hidden in diverse code expressions. The experimental results show that the deep learning models built on these techniques outperform the ones based on existing approaches not only in the prediction of vulnerabilities but also in the memory need. The factor of memory usage reductions of our techniques can be up to the order of 30,000 in comparison to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>INDICT: Code Generation with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for Both Security and Helpfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code are typically trained to align with natural language instructions to closely follow their intentions and requirements. However, in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic. Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the quality of output codes ($+10\%$ absolute improvements in all models).</description>

      <title>Curvature Clues: Decoding Deep Learning Privacy with Input Loss Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the properties of loss curvature with respect to input data in deep neural networks. Curvature of loss with respect to input (termed input loss curvature) is the trace of the Hessian of the loss with respect to the input. We investigate how input loss curvature varies between train and test sets, and its implications for train-test distinguishability. We develop a theoretical framework that derives an upper bound on the train-test distinguishability based on privacy and the size of the training set. This novel insight fuels the development of a new black box membership inference attack utilizing input loss curvature. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments in computer vision classification tasks, demonstrating that input loss curvature surpasses existing methods in membership inference effectiveness. Our analysis highlights how the performance of membership inference attack (MIA) methods varies with the size of the training set, showing that curvature-based MIA outperforms other methods on sufficiently large datasets. This condition is often met by real datasets, as demonstrated by our results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. These findings not only advance our understanding of deep neural network behavior but also improve the ability to test privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection: A Study of Model Performance on Complete vs. Partial Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, in anomaly detection systems when trained on complete flow records and tested on partial flow data. We explore the performance disparity that arises when models are applied to incomplete data typical in real-world, real-time network environments. Our findings demonstrate a significant decline in model performance, with precision and recall dropping by up to 30\% under certain conditions when models trained on complete flows are tested against partial flows. Conversely, models trained and tested on consistently complete or partial datasets maintain robustness, highlighting the importance of dataset consistency in training. The study reveals that a minimum of 7 packets in the test set is required for maintaining reliable detection rates. These results underscore the need for tailored training strategies that can effectively adapt to the dynamics of partial data, enhancing the practical applicability of anomaly detection systems in operational settings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Performance of Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection on Realistic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of software vulnerabilities on everyday software systems is significant. Despite deep learning models being proposed for vulnerability detection, their reliability is questionable. Prior evaluations show high recall/F1 scores of up to 99%, but these models underperform in practical scenarios, particularly when assessed on entire codebases rather than just the fixing commit. This paper introduces Real-Vul, a comprehensive dataset representing real-world scenarios for evaluating vulnerability detection models. Evaluating DeepWukong, LineVul, ReVeal, and IVDetect shows a significant drop in performance, with precision decreasing by up to 95 percentage points and F1 scores by up to 91 points. Furthermore, Model performance fluctuates based on vulnerability characteristics, with better F1 scores for information leaks or code injection than for path resolution or predictable return values. The results highlight a significant performance gap that needs addressing before deploying deep learning-based vulnerability detection in practical settings. Overfitting is identified as a key issue, and an augmentation technique is proposed, potentially improving performance by up to 30%. Contributions include a dataset creation approach for better model evaluation, Real-Vul dataset, and empirical evidence of deep learning models struggling in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Self-Evaluation as a Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When LLMs are deployed in sensitive, human-facing settings, it is crucial that they do not output unsafe, biased, or privacy-violating outputs. For this reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe prompts such as "Tell me how to build a bomb." We find that, despite these safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted, overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the importance of developing more robust alignment methods. Code and data will be made available at https://github.com/Linlt-leon/Adversarial-Alignments.</description>

      <title>Correlated Privacy Mechanisms for Differentially Private Distributed Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private distributed mean estimation (DP-DME) is a fundamental building block in privacy-preserving federated learning, where a central server estimates the mean of $d$-dimensional vectors held by $n$ users while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Local differential privacy (LDP) and distributed DP with secure aggregation (SecAgg) are the most common notions of DP used in DP-DME settings with an untrusted server. LDP provides strong resilience to dropouts, colluding users, and malicious server attacks, but suffers from poor utility. In contrast, SecAgg-based DP-DME achieves an $O(n)$ utility gain over LDP in DME, but requires increased communication and computation overheads and complex multi-round protocols to handle dropouts and malicious attacks. In this work, we propose CorDP-DME, a novel DP-DME mechanism that spans the gap between DME with LDP and distributed DP, offering a favorable balance between utility and resilience to dropout and collusion. CorDP-DME is based on correlated Gaussian noise, ensuring DP without the perfect conditional privacy guarantees of SecAgg-based approaches. We provide an information-theoretic analysis of CorDP-DME, and derive theoretical guarantees for utility under any given privacy parameters and dropout/colluding user thresholds. Our results demonstrate that (anti) correlated Gaussian DP mechanisms can significantly improve utility in mean estimation tasks compared to LDP -- even in adversarial settings -- while maintaining better resilience to dropouts and attacks compared to distributed DP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains facilitate secure resource transactions through smart contracts, yet these digital agreements are prone to vulnerabilities, particularly when interacting with external contracts, leading to substantial monetary losses. Traditional verification techniques fall short in providing comprehensive security assurances, especially against re-entrancy attacks, due to the unavailable implementations of external contracts. This paper introduces an incremental approach: gradual verification. We combine static and dynamic verification techniques to enhance security, guarantee soundness and flexibility, and optimize resource usage in smart contract interactions. By implementing a prototype for gradually verifying Algorand smart contracts via the pyTEAL language, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, contributing to the safe and efficient execution of smart contracts.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Safety of GPT-4o: An Empirical Study using Jailbreak Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent release of GPT-4o has garnered widespread attention due to its powerful general capabilities. While its impressive performance is widely acknowledged, its safety aspects have not been sufficiently explored. Given the potential societal impact of risky content generated by advanced generative AI such as GPT-4o, it is crucial to rigorously evaluate its safety. In response to this question, this paper for the first time conducts a rigorous evaluation of GPT-4o against jailbreak attacks. Specifically, this paper adopts a series of multi-modal and uni-modal jailbreak attacks on 4 commonly used benchmarks encompassing three modalities (ie, text, speech, and image), which involves the optimization of over 4,000 initial text queries and the analysis and statistical evaluation of nearly 8,000+ response on GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments reveal several novel observations: (1) In contrast to the previous version (such as GPT-4V), GPT-4o has enhanced safety in the context of text modality jailbreak; (2) The newly introduced audio modality opens up new attack vectors for jailbreak attacks on GPT-4o; (3) Existing black-box multimodal jailbreak attack methods are largely ineffective against GPT-4o and GPT-4V. These findings provide critical insights into the safety implications of GPT-4o and underscore the need for robust alignment guardrails in large models.

      <title>Ents: An Efficient Three-party Training Framework for Decision Trees by Communication Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07948v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-party training frameworks for decision trees based on secure multi-party computation enable multiple parties to train high-performance models on distributed private data with privacy preservation. The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion.
  In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by $5.5\times \sim 9.3\times$ in communication sizes and $3.9\times \sim 5.3\times$ in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of $3.5\times \sim 6.7\times$. To demonstrate its practicality, Ents requires less than three hours to securely train a decision tree on a widely used real-world dataset (Skin Segmentation) with more than 245,000 samples in the WAN setting.</description>

      <title>Private Hierarchical Governance for Encrypted Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing harms caused by hate, harassment, and other forms of abuse online have motivated major platforms to explore hierarchical governance. The idea is to allow communities to have designated members take on moderation and leadership duties; meanwhile, members can still escalate issues to the platform. But these promising approaches have only been explored in plaintext settings where community content is public to the platform. It is unclear how one can realize hierarchical governance in the huge and increasing number of online communities that utilize end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging for privacy.
  We propose private hierarchical governance systems. These should enable similar levels of community governance as in plaintext settings, while maintaining cryptographic privacy of content and governance actions not reported to the platform. We design the first such system, taking a layered approach that adds governance logic on top of an encrypted messaging protocol; we show how an extension to the message layer security (MLS) protocol suffices for achieving a rich set of governance policies. Our approach allows developers to rapidly prototype new governance features, taking inspiration from a plaintext system called PolicyKit. We build a prototype E2EE messaging system called MlsGov that supports content-based community and platform moderation, elections of community moderators, votes to remove abusive users, and more.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Blockchain Performance: Mitigating Conflicting Transactions through Parallelism and Dependency Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While blockchains initially gained popularity in the realm of cryptocurrencies, their widespread adoption is expanding beyond conventional applications, driven by the imperative need for enhanced data security. Despite providing a secure network, blockchains come with certain tradeoffs, including high latency, lower throughput, and an increased number of transaction failures. A pivotal issue contributing to these challenges is the improper management of "conflicting transactions", commonly referred to as "contention". When a number of pending transactions within a blockchain collide with each other, this results in a state of contention. This situation worsens network latency, leads to the wastage of system resources, and ultimately contributes to reduced throughput and higher transaction failures. In response to this issue, in this work, we present a novel blockchain scheme that integrates transaction parallelism and an intelligent dependency manager aiming to reduce the occurrence of conflicting transactions within blockchain networks. In terms of effectiveness and efficiency, experimental results show that our scheme not only mitigates the challenges posed by conflicting transactions, but also outperforms both existing parallel and non-parallel Hyperledger Fabric blockchain networks achieving higher transaction success rate, throughput, and latency. The integration of our scheme with Hyperledger Fabric appears to be a promising solution for improving the overall performance and stability of blockchain networks in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Skellam Mixture Mechanism: a Novel Approach to Federated Learning with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying training data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to this problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This paper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among multiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning (FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the confidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data leakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that common mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued noise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field integers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms require rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by this, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on models built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the assumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces the amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy accounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the Skellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The theoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i) the complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and (ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex, and to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive experiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the resulting model.</description>

      <title>Information Flow Control in Machine Learning through Modular Model Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's machine learning (ML) models, any part of the training data can affect the model output. This lack of control for information flow from training data to model output is a major obstacle in training models on sensitive data when access control only allows individual users to access a subset of data. To enable secure machine learning for access-controlled data, we propose the notion of information flow control for machine learning, and develop an extension to the Transformer language model architecture that strictly adheres to the IFC definition we propose. Our architecture controls information flow by limiting the influence of training data from each security domain to a single expert module, and only enables a subset of experts at inference time based on the access control policy.The evaluation using large text and code datasets show that our proposed parametric IFC architecture has minimal (1.9%) performance overhead and can significantly improve model accuracy (by 38% for the text dataset, and between 44%--62% for the code datasets) by enabling training on access-controlled data.</description>

      <title>The solving degrees for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of affine semi-regular polynomial sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the complexity of computing Gr\"{o}bner bases is an important problem both in theory and in practice, and for that the solving degree plays a key role. In this paper, we study the solving degrees of affine semi-regular sequences and their homogenized sequences. Some of our results are considered to give mathematically rigorous proofs of the correctness of methods for computing Gr\"{o}bner bases of the ideal generated by an affine semi-regular sequence. This paper is a sequel of the authors' previous work and gives additional results on the solving degrees and important behaviors of Gr\"obner basis computation.
  We also define the generalized degree of regularity for a sequence of homogeneous polynomials. For the homogenization of an affine semi-regular sequence, we relate its generalized degree of regularity with its maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree (i.e., the solving degree of the homogenized sequence). The definition of a generalized (cryptographic) semi-regular sequence is also given, and it derives a new cryptographic assumption to estimate the security of cryptosystems and signature schemes. From our experimental observation, we raise a conjecture and some questions related to this generalized semi-regularity. These new definitions and our results provide a theoretical formulation of (somehow heuristic) discussions done so far in the cryptographic community.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Comparative Analysis of Intrusion Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become a widely discussed topic, the related technologies facilitate better understanding of conventional black-box models like Random Forest, Neural Networks and etc. However, domain-specific applications of XAI are still insufficient. To fill this gap, this research analyzes various machine learning models to the tasks of binary and multi-class classification for intrusion detection from network traffic on the same dataset using occlusion sensitivity. The models evaluated include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). We trained all models to the accuracy of 90\% on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset. We found that most classifiers leverage only less than three critical features to achieve such accuracies, indicating that effective feature engineering could actually be far more important for intrusion detection than applying complicated models. We also discover that Random Forest provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, time efficiency and robustness.

      <title>Mind the Privacy Unit! User-Level Differential Privacy for Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling complex tasks across diverse domains, but they also raise privacy concerns when fine-tuned on sensitive data due to potential memorization. While differential privacy (DP) offers a promising solution by ensuring models are 'almost indistinguishable' with or without any particular privacy unit, current evaluations on LLMs mostly treat each example (text record) as the privacy unit. This leads to uneven user privacy guarantees when contributions per user vary. We therefore study user-level DP motivated by applications where it necessary to ensure uniform privacy protection across users. We present a systematic evaluation of user-level DP for LLM fine-tuning on natural language generation tasks. Focusing on two mechanisms for achieving user-level DP guarantees, Group Privacy and User-wise DP-SGD, we investigate design choices like data selection strategies and parameter tuning for the best privacy-utility tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Protecting Privacy in Classifiers by Token Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using language models as a remote service entails sending private information to an untrusted provider. In addition, potential eavesdroppers can intercept the messages, thereby exposing the information. In this work, we explore the prospects of avoiding such data exposure at the level of text manipulation. We focus on text classification models, examining various token mapping and contextualized manipulation functions in order to see whether classifier accuracy may be maintained while keeping the original text unrecoverable. We find that although some token mapping functions are easy and straightforward to implement, they heavily influence performance on the downstream task, and via a sophisticated attacker can be reconstructed. In comparison, the contextualized manipulation provides an improvement in performance.</description>

      <title>Video Watermarking: Safeguarding Your Video from (Unauthorized) Annotations by Video-based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of video-based Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced video understanding. However, it has also raised some safety concerns regarding data protection, as videos can be more easily annotated, even without authorization. This paper introduces Video Watermarking, a novel technique to protect videos from unauthorized annotations by such video-based LLMs, especially concerning the video content and description, in response to specific queries. By imperceptibly embedding watermarks into key video frames with multi-modal flow-based losses, our method preserves the viewing experience while preventing misuse by video-based LLMs. Extensive experiments show that Video Watermarking significantly reduces the comprehensibility of videos with various video-based LLMs, demonstrating both stealth and robustness. In essence, our method provides a solution for securing video content, ensuring its integrity and confidentiality in the face of evolving video-based LLMs technologies.</description>
