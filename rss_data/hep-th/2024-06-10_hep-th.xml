      <title>Quantum Extremal Modular Curvature: Modular Transport Behind Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular Berry transport is a useful way to understand how geometric bulk information is encoded in the boundary CFT: The modular curvature is directly related to the bulk Riemann curvature. We extend this approach by studying modular transport in the presence of a non-trivial quantum extremal surface. Focusing on JT gravity on an AdS background coupled to a non-gravitating bath, we compute the modular curvature of an interval in the bath in the presence of an island: the Quantum Extremal Modular Curvature (QEMC). We highlight some important properties of the QEMC, most importantly that it is non-local in general. In an OPE limit, the QEMC becomes local and probes the bulk Riemann curvature in regions behind a horizon. Our work gives a new approach to probe physics behind horizons.</description>

      <title>Recursive Landau Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a recursive method that makes use of the basic principle of unitarity to calculate the Landau singularities of n-point scattering amplitudes directly in kinematic space. For a vast class of Feynman diagrams, the method enables rapid analytic computation of Landau singularities beyond current state-of-the-art technology. This includes new predictions relevant for two- and higher-loop processes in the Standard Model involving both massive quarks and electroweak particles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and thermodynamic crossovers in the supercritical region of a holographic superfluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including classical fluids, present in their phase diagram the competition between two phases that are separated by a line of first-order phase transitions which terminates at a so-called critical point. Despite several proposals, in the supercritical region beyond the critical point, whether the two phases can still be distinguished and by which criterion remain open questions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics and linear dynamics of a holographic superfluid model with nonlinear potential terms in the supercritical region. We identify the presence of a dynamical crossover, akin to the liquid-like to gas-like Frenkel transition in supercritical fluids, and we define other separation lines of thermodynamic origin based on higher order derivatives of the free energy with respect to the charge density. Our results highlight the universal dynamical and thermodynamic features of supercritical systems from nuclear matter and classical fluids to superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of type-II holographic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work concerns the detailed construction of a holographic model for a type-II s-wave superconductor defined on a 5-dimensional anisotropic rotating black hole. We examine the role of rotation and anisotropy on the properties of the superconductor model focusing on the condensate and the AC conductivity, for which we obtain closed formulas, using both analytical and numerical methods. The results reveal that the rotation is responsible for the appearance of a peak and for introducing an exponentially vanishing behavior in the high-frequency limit of the real component of the AC conductivity. Such a behavior aligns with that observed in high-temperature superconductor models and experiments, where the peak and vanishing behavior result from quasiparticle damping, suggesting a plausible relation between the rotation of a black hole and quasiparticle damping effects in a superconducting material. In addition, we provide a detailed construction of the vortex lattice presented in arXiv:2208.05988 and study its behavior as a function of an external uniform magnetic field. Once again, it is shown that the vortex lattice can be continuously deformed along with a change in the vortex population by virtue of the magnetic field, providing a promising avenue for holographically modeling the vortex lattice deformations observed in experimental superconducting materials. As an observed experimental effect, we describe both the vortex lattice deformation and the vortex population increment under the action of an external magnetic field in the LiFeAs type-II superconductor. These effects supplement those previously found for the FeSe type-II superconductor studied in arXiv:2208.05988.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic dynamics of 3D gravity with Rindler boundary conditions both in flat and AdS spacetimes. We do this by using the angular quantization and Hamiltonian reduction of the action to the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory on the boundary. We then rewrite the boundary action as a functional of elements of the asymptotic symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Schottky Anomaly of Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the extended thermodynamics of black holes, there exists a thermodynamical pressure and its conjugate volume. Extensive studies have been conducted on the phase structure of numerous black holes, which have demonstrated striking similarities to the phase structure of various ordinary matter systems. A comparison of the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric AdS black holes with those of ordinary thermodynamic systems reveals that the isovolumetric heat capacity of the former is zero, whereas that of the latter is non-zero. It is a subject of interest for the intrinsic reason for this discrepancy. The effective thermodynamic quantities, based on the context of the boundary between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon in dS spacetime, as well as the interaction between the two horizons, are presented. The heat capacity in the Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) spacetime is then investigated, and it is demonstrated that the behavior of the heat capacity in the RN-dS spacetime is analogous to that of Schottky specific heat. Treating the two horizon interfaces in the RN-dS spacetime as two distinct energy levels in a two-energy system, and the thermodynamic properties in the RN-dS spacetime are discussed with the method of studying the thermodynamic properties in an ordinary two-energy system, to elucidate the intrinsic reasons for the occurrence of Schottky specific heat in the RN-dS spacetime. The heat capacity observed in the RN-dS spacetime is not only consistent with that of the Schottky specific heat described by the effective thermodynamic quantities in the RN-dS spacetime, but also with that of the heat capacity in an ordinary two-energy-level system. The quantum properties in the RN-dS spacetime are reflected, thereby providing a new avenue for further in-depth study of the quantum properties of black holes and dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Embedding Space Approach to JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coordinate-free background space construction of Euclidean Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. It is written as a gauge theory that utilizes the Killing vectors and conformal Killing vectors of a hyperboloid embedded in a three dimensional background. A novel feature of the gauge theory is that vanishing field strength does not necessarily imply that the gauge potentials are pure gauges, not even locally. As is usual, metric tensors are dynamically generated from the classical solutions of the theory, which here do not rely on coordinate charts on the two-dimensional surface. We find a special class of solutions whereby the derived metric tensor on the surface is the induced metric from the background space. The gauge theory construction given here has a natural generalization to a non-commutative space, which does not require the use of coordinates, symbols or a star product.</description>

      <title>Impact of the internal modes on the sphaleron decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sphaleron solutions in two deformations of the $\phi^6$ model and analyze the oscillons originated from them. We find that the presence of internal modes plays a crucial role in the sphaleron collapse. The positive internal modes triggered by a squeezing of the sphaleron are able to change the direction of collapse. We provide an analytical understanding behind this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Moving Mirrors, OTOCs and Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the physics of scrambling in the moving mirror models, in which a two-dimensional CFT is subjected to a time-dependent boundary condition. It is well-known that by choosing an appropriate mirror profile, one can model quantum aspects of black holes in two-dimensions, ranging from Hawking radiation in an eternal black hole (for an "escaping mirror") to the recent realization of Page curve in evaporating black holes (for a "kink mirror"). We explore a class of OTOCs in the presence of such a boundary and explicitly demonstrate the following primary aspects: First, we show that the dynamical CFT data directly affect an OTOC and maximally chaotic scrambling occurs for the escaping mirror for a large-$c$ CFT with identity block dominance. We further show that the exponential growth of OTOC associated with the physics of scrambling yields a power-law growth in the model for evaporating black holes which demonstrates a unitary dynamics in terms of a Page curve. We also demonstrate that, by tuning a parameter, one can naturally interpolate between an exponential growth associated to scrambling and a power-law growth in unitary dynamics. Our work explicitly exhibits the role of higher-point functions in CFT dynamics as well as the distinction between scrambling and Page curve. We also discuss several future possibilities based on this class of models.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Relativistic Quantum Fields in Spatial Subregions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a state of a relativistic quantum field theory restricted to a spatial subregion $\Omega$. More precisely, we use the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism to describe the dynamics of the field theory in the interior of $\Omega$ arising after integrating out the degrees of freedom in the exterior. We show how the influence of the environment gets encoded in a boundary term. Furthermore, we derive a stochastic equation of motion for the field expectation value in the interior. We find that the boundary conditions obtained in this way are energy non-conserving and non-local in space and time. Our results find applications in understanding the emergence of local thermalization in relativistic quantum field theories and the relationship between quantum field theory and relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Minimal Cuts and Genealogical Constraints on Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method for deriving hierarchical constraints on the discontinuities of individual Feynman integrals. This method can be applied at any loop order and particle multiplicity, and to any configuration of massive or massless virtual particles. The resulting constraints hold to all orders in dimensional regularization, and complement the extended Steinmann relations -- which restrict adjacent sequential discontinuities -- by disallowing ordered pairs of discontinuities from appearing even when separated by (any number of) other discontinuities. We focus on a preferred class of hierarchical constraints, which we refer to as \emph{genealogical constraints}, that govern what singularities can follow from certain \emph{minimal cuts} that act as the primogenitors of the discontinuities that appear in Feynman integrals. While deriving the full set of hierarchical constraints on a given Feynman integral generally requires identifying all solutions to the (blown up) Landau equations, these genealogical constraints can be worked out with only minimal information about what singularities may appear. We illustrate the power of this new method in examples at one, two, and three loops, and provide evidence that genealogical constraints restrict the analytic structure of Feynman integrals significantly more than the extended Steinmann relations.</description>

      <title>Cartan monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonians for chiral supersymmetric gauge theories at small spatial volume are generalizations of the Hamiltonians describing the motion of a scalar or a spinor particle in a field of Dirac monopoles (we are dealing in fact with a certain lattice of monopoles supplemented with a periodic singular potential). The gauge fields in such Hamiltonians belong to the Cartan subalgebras of the corresponding gauge algebras. Such a construction exists for all groups admitting complex representations, i.e. for $SU(N \geq 3), \ Spin(4n+2)$ with $n \geq 1$ and $E_6$. We give explicit expressions for these Hamiltonians for $SU(3)$, $SU(4) \simeq Spin(6)$ and for $SU(5)$. The simplified version of such a Hamiltonian, deprived of fermion terms, of the extra scalar potential and when only one node of the lattice is taken into consideration, describe a $3r$-dimensional motion ($r$ being the rank of the group) in the field what we call a {\it Cartan monopole}. As is the case for the ordinary monopole, the Lagrangian of this system enjoys gauge symmetry, rotational symmetry, and the parameter, generalizing the notion of magnetic charge for Cartan monopoles, is quantized.</description>

      <title>The matrix model of two-color one-flavor QCD: The ultra-strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using variational methods, we numerically investigate the matrix model for the two-color QCD coupled to a single quark (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$) in the limit of ultra-strong Yang-Mills coupling ($g =\infty$). The spectrum of the model has superselection sectors labelled by baryon number $B$ and spin $J$. We study sectors with $B=0,1,2$ and $J=0,1$, which may be organized as mesons, (anti-)diquarks and (anti-)tetraquarks. For each of these sectors, we study the properties of the respective ground states in both chiral and heavy quark limits, and uncover a rich quantum phase transition (QPT) structure. We also investigate the division of the total spin between the glue and the quark and show that glue contribution is significant for several of these sectors. For the $(B,J)=(0,0)$ sector, we find that the dominant glue contribution to the ground state comes from reducible connections. Finally, in the presence of non-trivial baryon chemical potential $\mu$, we construct the phase diagram of the model. For sufficiently large $\mu$, we find that the ground state of the theory may have non-zero spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and the entanglement properties of two-dimensional conformal field theories ($2$d CFTs) on curved backgrounds are studied. By means of conformal mapping we study the equivalent system on flat space governed by the deformed Hamiltonian, which is a spatial integral of the Hamiltonian density modulated by an enveloping function. Focusing on holographic CFTs, we observe Hawking-Page like phase transition for the thermal and the entanglement entropy as we vary the background metric. We also compute the mutual information to study the information theoretic correlation between parts of the curved spacetime. The gravity dual of 2d CFTs on curved background is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Negative Action Keldysh Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss quantization of Dirac spinors with action which is the negative of the standard action. Using the Keldysh QFT formulation, we show that the standard quantization of such Keldysh spinors results in the Hamiltonian bounded from above and in S-matrix for backwards in time scattering. The alternative quantization produces the standard Hamiltonian bounded from below and the standard S-matrix for forwards in time scattering. When the two masses are equal, the sum of their actions describes the standard Keldysh out-of-time-order correlators. When both Keldysh and Dirac spinors are present in a QFT, the standard Fock space is augmented by negative energy states, while its positive and the negative subspaces share the same vacuum state. In absence of gravity the Dirac and the Keldysh spinors do not interact and positive and negative energy states do not exchange quanta with non-zero energy. If Keldysh spinors exist in Nature, then the Universe would consist of bosonic and fermionic particles that are described by both positive and negative Fock energy states with a single vacuum state that cannot be crossed from either side. Such a scenario could explain the non-observation of dark energy/dark matter except via classical gravity.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretic Example for Hodge Theory in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the continuous symmetry transformations for the three ($2 + 1$)-dimensional (3D) system of a combination of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We establish that this combined system is a tractable field-theoretic model of Hodge theory. The symmetry operators of our present theory provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. Our present investigation is important in the sense that, for the first time, we are able to establish an odd dimensional (i.e. $D = 3$) field-theoretic system to be an example for Hodge theory (besides earlier works on a few interesting ($0 + 1$)-dimensional toy models as well as a set of well-known ${\mathcal N} = 2$ SUSY quantum mechanical systems of physical interest).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the flat space limit of AdS using the momentum space representation of CFT correlators. The flat space limit involves sending the AdS radius and the dimensions of operators dual to massive fields to infinity while also scaling appropriately the sources of the dual operators. In this limit, d-dimensional CFT correlators become (d+1)-dimensional scattering amplitudes. We exemplify our discussion with the computation of the flat-space limit of the CFT 3-point function of a conserved current, a non-conserved charged vector operator and its conjugate. The flat-space limit should yield the scattering amplitude of an Abelian gauge field with two massive vector fields. This scattering amplitude computes the electromagnetic form factors of the electromagnetic current in a spin-1 state, and these form factors encode the electromagnetic properties of the massive vector field (charge, magnetic moment and quadruple moment). In terms of the CFT, the flat-space limit amounts to zooming in the infrared region of the triple-K integrals that determine the 3-point function, while also scaling to infinity the order of (some of) the Bessel functions that feature in the triple-K integrals. In this limit the triple-K integral becomes proportional to the energy-preserving delta function, and the flat space limit correctly yields the corresponding flat space scattering amplitude in complete detail.</description>

      <title>Flavor neutrinos as unstable particles: an interaction picture view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the similarities in the behavior of unstable particles and oscillating neutrinos using perturbation theory within the interaction picture of quantum field theory. We begin by examining how decaying systems are studied in the interaction picture and then demonstrate how similar calculations can be performed to determine the transition probabilities for flavor oscillations. Notably, the expressions for neutrino oscillations and particle decays are identical in the short-time range. Furthermore, we show that the flavor oscillation formula derived through this method matches, within the adopted approximation, the one obtained using the flavor Fock space approach.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Vacuum of Spacetime with a Fundamental Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum theory of gravity implies a fine-grained structure of spacetime, which can be conveniently modeled as some form of pixelation at the Planck scale, with potentially observable consequences. In this work, we build upon previous results to investigate the effect of pixelation on the quantum vacuum, making use of the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). At the center of the DSR approach is an observer dependent length scale, defining the pixelation of spacetime. A key feature of quantum field theory in DSR is the dispersive nature of the vacuum state and the associated appearance of curvature in momentum space. As a result, the standard treatment of the renormalized stress-energy-momentum tensor acquires correction terms. As an illustration, we present here a calculation of the thermal vacuum and modified Casimir effect, using both modified propagators and momentum measures. We choose a consistent choice of momentum space metric that both generates the modified dispersion relations we use and preserves the Lorentz invariant character of the results obtained. Put together this constitutes a consistent calculation framework we can apply to other more complex scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using holography, we study the universal scaling laws governing the coarsening dynamics of strongly coupled domain walls. Specifically, we studied the universal dependence of the length of the domain wall interfaces on the quench rate. The relation satisfies the Kibble-Zurek scaling shortly after the critical point. However, as time goes by, the coarsening dynamics suppresses the Kibble-Zurek scaling in favor of a universal dynamical scaling of the characteristic length and the adiabatic growth of the system. Theoretical predictions of the universal scaling laws are consistent with numerical findings in both regimes for both weak and strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of Majorana neutrinos in supernova and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptonic CP violation is one of the most important topics in neutrino physics. CP violation in the neutrino sector is strongly related to the nature of neutrinos: whether they are Dirac or Majorana particles. In \cite{Popov:2021icg} we have shown that for Majorana neutrinos appearance of nonzero Majorana CP-violating phases combined with strong magnetic field during supernova core-collapse can induce new resonances in neutrino oscillations, for example in $\nu_e \to \bar{\nu}_\tau$ channel. In this paper we further study new resonances in Majorana neutrino oscillations, in particular energy dependence of amplitudes of resonant oscillations. Our findings suggest a potential astrophysical setup for studying the nature of neutrino masses and leptonic CP violation and may be important for future neutrino experiments, such as JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model with the full one-loop prefactor. We focus on the gauge degrees of freedom and derive the degeneracy factors appearing in the functional determinant using group theoretical arguments. Our treatment shows that the transverse modes were previously overcounted, so we revise the calculation of that part of the prefactor. The new result modifies the gauge fields' contribution by $7\%$ and slightly decreases the previously predicted lifetime of the electroweak vacuum, which remains much longer than the age of the universe. Our discussion of the transverse mode degeneracy applies to any calculation of functional determinants involving gauge fields in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Probably the simplest and cheapest quantum Monte Carlo method so far for extracting high-precision entanglement entropy and its derivative</title>

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy (EE) to probe the intrinsic physics of quantum many-body systems is an important but challenging topic in condensed matter, high energy and computational physics. Designing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to obtain the R\'enyi EE is a promising solution in large-scale many-body systems. However, to gain high-precision EE, the QMC-based algorithm for EE becomes more and more complex at the designing level. The entangled region needs being changed during the QMC simulation, and the detailed balance condition becomes more complicated. Moreover, the intermediately incremental processes introduced cannot be exploited neither. In this paper, we propose a simple QMC scheme able to extract EE and its derivative with high-precision, which requires neither changing replica manifold during the simulation nor adding extra detailed balance conditions. All the values measured in the incremental process are the EE under physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency. It opens an access to numerically probe the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in 2D and higher dimensional systems. The method has low-technical barrier and is natural for parallel computing. Our algorithm makes it no longer a dream to calculate a large amount of high-precision EE values without complicated techniques and huge computational cost.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional ``spin'' systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of the Field Correlator Method (FCM) is discussed, with applications to the most interesting areas of QCD physics obtained in the lattice data and experiment. These areas include: a) the connection of colorelectric confinement with the basic quark and gluon condensates; b) the explicit form of the colorelectric deconfinement at a growing temperature $T$; c) the theory of the colormagnetic confinement at all temperatures; d) the theory of strong decays, the theory of pdf and jets in the instantaneous formalism with confinement. We demonstrate that the FCM with instantaneous formalism and confinement (instead of the light cone formalism and pure perturbation theory) can provide the way to the theory of QCD, which helps to describe world data without phenomenological parameters.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Torsion on Neutron Star Structure in Einstein-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein--Cartan gravity is a close historical sibling of general relativity that allows for spacetime torsion. As a result, angular momentum couples to spacetime geometry in a similar way to energy. While consequences of this are well studied on cosmological scales, their role in neutron star physics is largely under-explored. We study the effects that torsion, sourced by either microphysical spin or macroscopic angular momentum, has on neutron stars. For this, we use a simplified polytropic model to quantify the microphysical coupling to torsion. We also derive expressions to model rotation-induced torsion effects and estimate the consequences for rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates. We find that the presence of torsion in general leads to neutron stars with smaller radii and masses, but higher central densities. Realistic models for microphysical spin lead to torsion effects that have no relevant influence on the neutron star structure. Rotation-induced torsion effects however, can decrease the radius by up to $900\,m$, which is comparable to the increase due to centrifugal forces. Depending on which effect dominates, this leads to a torsion-induced spin-up or spin-down of the neutron star. We conclude that torsion effects due to rotation can not be neglected and are large enough to be tested using current or near-future technology.</description>

Abstract: We apply the recently developed concept of the nucleon energy-energy correlator (NEEC) for the gluon sector to investigate the long-range azimuthal angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The spinning gluon in these collisions will introduce a significant nonzero $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries in both Higgs Boson and top quark pair productions. The genesis of the $\cos(2\phi)$ correlation lies in the intricate quantum entanglement. Owing to the substantial $\cos(2\phi)$ effect, the NEEC observable in Higgs Boson and $t{\bar t}$ production emerges as a pivotal avenue for delving into quantum entanglement and scrutinizing the Bell inequality at high-energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: Revisiting the issue associated with Position-Dependent Mass (PDM), we reaffirm that the appropriate framework for addressing a generic PDM is the symmetrization proposed by BenDaniel and Duke. To accomplish this result adopts the effective mass Hamiltonian proposed by von Roos, corrected by a symmetrized kinematic term. After verifying the appropriate ordering to approach the PDM issue, one investigates a crystalline lattice with a defect described by a singular PDM. The singular mass profile proves intriguing as it yields an atom's cluster in the neighborhood of the singularity. Considering that a restoring force acts on the atoms, one notes that the confluent Heun function describes the quantum states. Furthermore, one highlights that when the effective mass distribution tends to a constant profile, we recover a system similar to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse: admissible complex metrics and the associated heat kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms is ensured. In particular, the resulting complex metrics are admissible in the sense of Kontsevich-Segal in all (fiducial and non-fiducial) foliations. This setting is used to construct a Wick rotated heat semigroup, which remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. Among the results established for the Wick rotated version are: (i) Existence as an analytic semigroup uniquely determined by its sectorial generator. (ii) Construction of an integral kernel that is jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (iii) Existence of an asymptotic expansion for the kernel's diagonal in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-deWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics. (iv) Emergence of a Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group in the strict Lorentzian limit. The toolbox includes local regularity results for admissible complex metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an emergent metric developed from deep learning techniques, we determine the complex potential associated with static quarkonium. This study explores the disintegration process of quarkonium by analyzing the real component of this potential, which is crucial for understanding its stability in various conditions. We show that the dissociation length, the critical distance at which a quark and antiquark pair disintegrate, decreases as the temperature increases. Furthermore, our assessment of the imaginary component of the potential indicates an increase in the magnitude of the imaginary potential for quarkonium as temperatures rise. This enhancement contributes to the quarkonium's suppression within the quark-gluon plasma, mirroring the anticipated outcomes from QCD. Our findings not only confirm the theoretical predictions but also demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning methods in advancing our understanding of high-energy particle physics.</description>

Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing frequentist profile likelihoods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES dataset at up to $2.5 \sigma$ level. At the highest redshifts, one encounters negative dark energy densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

Abstract: Models of scalar field dark matter where the scalar is a dilaton have a special behaviour, since non-trivial couplings, $d$, to matter result in a contribution to the potential for the field which is proportional to the trace of the stress-energy tensor. We look in more detail at the dilaton mass, $m_\phi$, and initial conditions required to yield the correct relic abundance for couplings that are not already excluded by terrestrial experiments. In minimal models with only couplings accessible to terrestrial searches, we find that dilaton dark matter with $m_{\phi} \gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV requires couplings suppressed compared to constraints from equivalence principle (EP) tests and fifth force searches in order to not produce too much dark matter, improving on the strongest current experimental constraints by up to $\sim {\cal O}(10)$, with consequences for the proposed mechanical resonator dilaton DM searches. In non-minimal or universally coupled models, the unconstrained couplings of the dilaton to e.g. the top quark can strongly influence the relic abundance at all masses. In particular, this implies that atom interferometry searches at masses $m_\phi\approx 10^{-19}\text{ eV}$ are unable to constrain the early Universe behaviour or UV physics of the dilaton. We also find that dilatonic couplings allow for compatibility of $m_\phi \gtrsim 10^{-7}\text{ eV}$ with an observably large tensor-to-scalar ratio in the cosmic microwave background, which is not possible for a decoupled scalar of the same mass.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance of the eta-deformed AdS5 x S5 superstring, T-duality and modified type II equations</title>

Abstract: We consider the ABF background underlying the eta-deformed AdS5 x S5 sigma model. This background fails to satisfy the standard IIB supergravity equations which indicates that the corresponding sigma model is not Weyl invariant, i.e. does not define a critical string theory in the usual sense. We argue that the ABF background should still correspond to UV finite theory on a flat 2d world-sheet, implying that the eta-deformed model is scale invariant. This property follows from the formal relation via T-duality between the eta-deformed model and the one defined by an exact type IIB supergravity solution that has 6 isometries albeit broken by a linear dilaton. We find that the ABF background satisfies candidate type IIB scale invariance conditions which for the R-R field strengths are of the second order in derivatives. Surprisingly, we also find that the this background obeys an interesting modification of the standard IIB supergravity equations that are first order in derivatives of R-R fields. These modified equations explicitly depend on Killing vectors of the ABF background and, although not universal, imply the universal scale invariance conditions. Moreover, we show that it is precisely the non-isometric dilaton of the T-dual solution that leads, after the T-duality, to a modification of type II equations from their standard form. We conjecture that the modified equations should follow from kappa-symmetry of the eta-deformed model. All our observations apply also to eta-deformations of AdS3 x S3 and AdS2 x S2 models.</description>

Abstract: We review the construction of Lagrangians for higher spin fields of mixed symmetry in the framework of graded geometry. The main advantage of the graded formalism in this context is that it provides universal expressions, in the sense that a given Lagrangian describes the dynamics of any type of bosonic tensor field even though the corresponding explicit expressions in terms of local field components and their derivatives look rather different. Aside from free fields and their kinetic terms, we also consider higher derivative interaction terms that lead to second order field equations. For scalars, differential forms and bipartite tensors, these are identified with Galileon theories, written in a simple yet elegant form as a generalised kinetic term, and are gauge invariant by construction. For fields of spin higher than 2, we illustrate the candidate Galileon-like interactions and argue that full gauge invariance and locality cannot be simultaneously maintained.</description>

      <title>BCS in the Sky: Signatures of Inflationary Fermion Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like model in the inflationary background. We show that with an axial chemical potential, the attractive quartic fermion self-interaction can lead to a BCS-like condensation. In the rigid-de Sitter (dS) limit of inflation where backreaction from the inflaton and graviton is neglected, we perform the first computation of the non-perturbative effective potential that includes the full spacetime curvature effects in the presence of the chemical potential, subject to the mean-field approximation whose validity has been checked via the Ginzburg criterion. The corresponding BCS phase transition is always first-order, when the varying Hubble is interpreted as an effective Gibbons-Hawking temperature of dS spacetime. In the condensed phase, the theory can be understood from UV and IR sides as fermionic and bosonic, respectively. This leads to distinctive signatures in the primordial non-Gaussianity of curvature perturbations. Namely, the oscillatory cosmological collider signal is smoothly turned off at a finite momentum ratio, since different momentum ratios effectively probe different energy scales. In addition, such BCS phase transitions can also source stochastic gravitational waves, which are feasible for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dual CFT on Nariai limit for Kerr-Sen-dS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Kerr-Sen-de Sitter black hole~(BH) in the Nariai limit where the event and cosmological horizon coincide. We show that the near-horizon Kerr-Sen-de Sitter black hole in Nariai limit is a fiber over AdS$_2$ with an appropriate coordinate transformation, instead of fiber over dS$_2$. Hence, we can compute the associated central charge and CFT temperature by using the Kerr/CFT method. It is remarkably exhibited that through Cardy's growth of states, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy on cosmological horizon is reproduced. Moreover, we show that the radial equation of the quantum scalar field in $J$- and $Q$-pictures on this charged rotating background in Nariai limit can be portrayed in quadratic Casimir operator form with $SL(2,R)\times SL(2,R)$ isometry. We also compute the corresponding thermodynamic quantities from CFT to find the absorption cross-section and real-time correlator in $J$-picture. In $Q$-picture, we do not find a well-defined CFT description. We then extend the study of quantum scalar field in Nariai limit for Kerr-Newman-dS black hole solution and show that the hidden conformal symmetry on this black hole's background in in $J$- and $Q$-pictures is well-defined.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal Kerr-like ECO in the Kerr/CFT Correspondence in Higher Spin Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr/CFT correspondence has been established to explore the quantum theory of gravity in the near-horizon geometry of a extreme Kerr black holes. The quantum gravitational corrections on the near-horizon region may manifest in form of a partially reflective membrane that replace the horizon. In such modification, the black holes now can be seen as a horizonless exotic compact object (ECO). In this paper, we consider the properties of Kerr-like ECOs in near-extremal condition using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We study the quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section in that background and compare these by using CFT dual computation. The corresponding dual CFT one needs to incorporate finite size/finite $N$ effects in the dual CFT terminology. We also extend the dual CFT analysis for higher spin perturbations such as photon and graviton. We find consistency between properties of the ECOs from gravity sides and from CFT sides. The quasinormal mode spectrum is in line with non-extreme case, where the differences are in the length of the circle, on which the dual CFT lives, and phase shift of the incoming perturbation. The absorption cross-section has oscillatory feature that start to disappear near extremal limit. The particle spin determines the phase shift and conformal weight. We also obtain that the echo time-delay depends on the position of the membrane and extremality of the ECOs.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for warped AdS$_2$ solutions of Type II supergravity to preserve ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, in terms of bispinors. Such solutions generically support an SU$(3)$-structure on their internal manifold M$_8$, which can experience an enhancement to a G$_2$-structure. We perform an SU$(3)$-structure torsion classes analysis and express the fluxes and other physical fields in terms of these, in general. We use our results to derive two new classes of AdS$_2$ solutions. In (massive) Type IIA supergravity we derive an ${\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetric class for which M$_8$ decomposes as a weak G$_2$-manifold foliated over an interval and which is locally defined in terms of a degree three polynomial. In Type IIB supergravity we find a class of AdS$_2\times\text{S}^2\times\text{CY}_2\times\Sigma_2$ solutions preserving small ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry, governed by a harmonic function on $\Sigma_2$ and partial differential equations reminiscent of D3-D7-brane configurations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the evolution of quantum fields during inflation, and show that the total-energy singularities appearing in the perturbative expansion of the late-time Wavefunction of the Universe are purely real when the external states are massless scalars and massless gravitons. Our proof relies on the tree-level approximation, Bunch-Davies initial conditions, and exact scale invariance (IR-convergence), but without any assumptions on invariance under de Sitter boosts. We consider all $n$-point functions and allow for the exchange of additional states of any mass and integer spin. Our proof makes use of a decomposition of the inflationary bulk-bulk propagator of massive spinning fields which preserves UV-convergence and ensures that the time-ordered contributions are purely real after we rotate to Euclidean time. We use this reality property to show that the maximally-connected parts of wavefunction coefficients, from which total-energy singularities originate, are purely real. In a theory where all states are in the complementary series, this reality extends to the full wavefunction coefficient. We then use our reality theorem to show that parity-odd correlators (correlators that are mirror asymmetric) are factorised and do not diverge when the total-energy is conserved. We pay special attention to the parity-odd four-point function (trispectrum) of inflationary curvature perturbations and use our reality/factorisation theorems to show that this observable is factorised into a product of cubic diagrams thereby enabling us to derive exact shapes. We present examples of couplings between the inflaton and massive spin-1 and spin-2 fields, with the parity-violation in the trispectrum driven by Chern-Simons corrections to the spinning field two-point function, or from parity-violating cubic interactions which we build within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation.</description>

      <title>Ghost Problem, Spectrum Identities and Various Constraints on Brane-localized Gravity</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the brane-localized interactions, including DGP gravity and higher derivative (HD) gravity localized on the brane. We derive the effective action on the brane, which suggests the brane-localized HD gravity suffers the ghost problem generally. Besides, we obtain novel algebraic identities of the mass spectrum, which reveal the global nature and can characterize the phase transformation of the mass spectrum. We get a powerful ghost-free condition from the spectrum identities, which rules out one type of brane-localized HD gravity. We further prove the mass spectrum is real and non-negative $m^2\ge 0$ under the ghost-free condition.
  Furthermore, we discuss various constraints on parameters of brane-localized gravity in AdS/BCFT and wedge holography, respectively. They include the ghost-free condition of Kaluza-Klein and brane-bending modes, the positive definiteness of boundary central charges, and entanglement entropy. The ghost-free condition imposes strict constraint, which requires non-negative couplings for pure DGP gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity on the brane. It also rules out one class of brane-localized HD gravity. Thus, such HD gravity should be understood as a low-energy effective theory on the brane under the ghost energy scale. Finally, we briefly discuss the applications of our results.</description>

      <title>T-Minkowski noncommutative spacetimes I: Poincar\'e groups, differential calculi and braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates a class of noncommutative spacetimes that I will call ``T-Minkowski,'' whose quantum Poincar\'e group of isometries exhibits unique and physically motivated characteristics. Notably, the coordinates on the Lorentz subgroup remain commutative, while the deformation is confined to the translations (hence the T in the name), which act like an integrable set of vector fields on the Lorentz group. This is similar to Majid's bicrossproduct construction, although my approach allows the description of spacetimes with commutators that include a constant matrix as well as terms that are linear in the coordinates (the resulting structure is that of a centrally-extended Lie algebra). Moreover, I require that one can define a covariant braided tensor product representation of the quantum Poincar\'e group, describing the algebra of N-points. This also implies that a 4-dimensional bicovariant differential calculus exists on the noncommutative spacetime. The resulting models can all be described in terms of a numerical triangular R-matrix through RTT relations (as well as RXX, RXY and RXdX relations for the homogeneous spacetime, the braiding and the differential calculus). The R-matrices I find are in one-to-one correspondence with the triangular r-matrices on the Poincar\'e group without quadratic terms in the Lorentz generators. These have been classified, up to automorphisms, by Zakrzewski, and amount to 16 inequivalent models. This paper is the first of a series, focusing on the identification of all the quantum Poincar\'e groups that are allowed by my assumptions, as well as the associated quantum homogeneous spacetimes, differential calculi and braiding constructions.</description>

Abstract: We advance a covariant construction for the holographic odd entanglement entropy (OEE) of time dependent bipartite states in CFT$_2$s dual to bulk AdS$_3$ geometries. In this context we obtain the OEE for bipartite states in zero, finite temperature and finite size CFT$_2$s dual to bulk pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ black hole geometries through appropriate replica techniques. The replica technique results for the time dependent OEE are reproduced modulo constants in the large central charge limit through holographic computations involving the bulk entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS). Subsequently we obtain the time dependent OEE for bipartite states in zero and finite temperature CFT$_2$s with a conserved charge dual to bulk extremal and non-extremal rotating BTZ black holes through both field theory and covariant holographic computations which again match up to constants in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4$ is exactly dual to string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_3\times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ with minimal ($k=1$) NS-NS flux. In this paper we study the perturbation of the symmetric orbifold that is dual to switching on R-R flux, and hence to deforming the theory away from the tensionless point. More specifically, we determine systematically the action of a centrally extended supersymmetry algebra on the CFT states, and deduce from it the anomalous conformal dimensions. In the $w$-twisted sector with large $w$ the structure is similar to what was found for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM: the basic excitations are multi-magnons whose individual dispersion relation is fixed by symmetry, and the comparison with the BMN answer suggests that the result is true to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally we show that the multi-magnon states interact via an integrable $S$-matrix and possess a natural family of bound states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate, in the framework of the topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, using the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy, the topological numbers of the static multi-charge AdS black holes in four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravities. We find that the topological number of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (K-K) gauged supergravity theory is $W = 0$, while that of the static-charged AdS black holes in four-dimensional gauged $-iX^0X^1$-supergravity and STU gauged supergravity theories, and five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gauged supergravity and STU gauged supergravity, and five-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole are both $W = 1$. Furthermore, we observe a novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition that can happen in the four-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in EMDA gauged supergravity theory, the four-dimensional static-charged AdS Horowitz-Sen black hole, and the five-dimensional static-charged AdS black hole in K-K gauged supergravity theory. We believe that the novel temperature-dependent thermodynamic topological phase transition could help us better understand black hole thermodynamics and, further, shed new light on the fundamental nature of gauged supergravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We present a deterministic way of finding contraction maps for candidate holographic entanglement entropy inequalities modulo choices due to actual degeneracy. We characterize its complexity and give an argument for the completeness of the contraction map proof method as a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of an entropy inequality for holographic entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We show how to encode the radiative degrees of freedom in $4$-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, using the boundary Cotton and stress tensors. Background radiation leads to a reduction of the asymptotic symmetry group, in contrast to asymptotically flat spacetimes, where a non-vanishing news tensor does not restrict the asymptotic symmetries. Null gauges, such as $\Lambda$-BMS, provide a framework for AdS spacetimes that include radiation in the flat limit. We use this to check that the flat limit of the radiative data matches the expected definition in intrinsically asymptotically flat spacetimes. We further dimensionally reduce our construction to the celestial sphere, and show how the $2$-dimensional celestial currents can be extracted from the $3$-dimensional boundary data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid inflation from supersymmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recently proposed framework, dubbed inflation by supersymmetry breaking, to hybrid inflation by introducing a waterfall field that allows to decouple the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector from the inflation scale, while keeping intact the inflation sector and its successful predictions: naturally small slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions and absence of the pseudo-scalar companion of the inflaton, in terms of one free parameter which is the first order correction to the inflaton K\"ahler potential. During inflation, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with the inflaton being the superpartner of the goldstino, together with a massive vector that gauges the R-symmetry. Inflation arises around the maximum of the scalar potential at the origin where R-symmetry is unbroken. Moreover, a nearby minimum with tuneable vacuum energy can be accommodated by introducing a second order correction to the K\"ahler potential. The inflaton sector can also play the role of the supersymmetry breaking 'hidden' sector when coupled to the (supersymmetric) Standard Model, predicting a superheavy superparticle spectrum near the inflation scale. Here we show that the introduction of a waterfall field provides a natural way to end inflation and allows for a scale separation between supersymmetry breaking and inflation. Moreover, the study of the global vacuum describing low energy Standard Model physics can be done in a perturbative way within a region of the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <title>Defining the type IIB matrix model without breaking Lorentz symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is a promising nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory, which may elucidate the emergence of (3+1)-dimensional space-time. However, the partition function is divergent due to the Lorentz symmetry, which is represented by a noncompact group. This divergence has been regularized conventionally by introducing some infrared cutoff, which breaks the Lorentz symmetry. Here we point out that Lorentz invariant observables become classical as one removes the infrared cutoff and that this "classicalization" is actually an artifact of the Lorentz symmetry breaking cutoff. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a natural way to "gauge-fix" the Lorentz symmetry in a fully nonperturbative manner. This also enables us to perform numerical simulations in such a way that the time-evolution can be extracted directly from the matrix configurations.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory (EFT) for conformal impurity by considering a pair of transversely displaced impurities and integrating out modes with mass inversely proportional to the separation distance. This EFT captures the universal signature of the impurity seen by a heavy local operator. We focus on the case of conformal boundaries and derive universal formulas from this EFT for the boundary structure constants at high energy. We point out that the more familiar thermal EFT for conformal field theory is a special case of this EFT with distinguished conformal boundaries. We also derive, for general conformal impurities, non-positivity and convexity-like constraints on the Casimir energy which determines the leading EFT coefficient.</description>

      <title>Global Embedding of Fibre Inflation in Perturbative LVS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a global embedding of the Fibre inflation model in perturbative large volume scenario (LVS) in which the inflationary potential is induced via a combination of string-loop corrections and higher derivative F$^4$-effects. The minimal Fibre inflation model developed in the standard LVS generically faces some strong bounds on the inflaton field range arising from the K\"ahler cone constraints, which subsequently creates a challenge for realising the cosmological observables while consistently respecting the underlying supergravity approximations. The main attractive feature of this proposal is to naturally alleviate this issue by embedding Fibre inflation in perturbative LVS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore several features related to the newly discovered hidden amplitude zeros arXiv:2312.16282, which describe the vanishing of scattering amplitudes on special external kinematics. We prove the conjecture that amplitude zeros uniquely fix Tr $\phi^3$, by showing that any amplitude can be divided into special subsets, which independently satisfy the zero condition. We further prove that the same subsets satisfy a previously unknown secret enhancement under Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts, which turns out to be equivalent to the amplitude zero condition. Similar but weaker statements also hold for non-linear sigma model, while for Yang-Mills, when imposed together with color-kinematic duality, amplitude zeros uniquely fix the different tensor components of gluon amplitudes. This direction suggests a straightforward avenue for understanding previous similar uniqueness results, as well as the connections between naively independent properties of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Hierarchies, Large Lepton Mixing and Residual Modular Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modular-invariant models of flavour, hierarchical fermion mass matrices may arise solely due to the proximity of the modulus $\tau$ to a point of residual symmetry. This mechanism does not require flavon fields, and modular weights are not analogous to Froggatt-Nielsen charges. Instead, we show that hierarchies depend on the decomposition of field representations under the residual symmetry group. We systematically go through the possible fermion field representation choices which may yield hierarchical structures in the vicinity of symmetric points, for the four smallest finite modular groups, isomorphic to $S_3$, $A_4$, $S_4$, and $A_5$, as well as for their double covers. We find a restricted set of pairs of representations for which the discussed mechanism may produce viable fermion (charged-lepton and quark) mass hierarchies. We present two lepton flavour models in which the charged-lepton mass hierarchies are naturally obtained, while lepton mixing is somewhat fine-tuned. After formulating the conditions for obtaining a viable lepton mixing matrix in the symmetric limit, we construct a model in which both the charged-lepton and neutrino sectors are free from fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: How the spacetime evolved non-perturbatively in a landscape with multiple anti-de Sitter (AdS) vacua, which is theoretically well-motivated, has always been a matter of concern. As a step towards this issue, we perform (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations for the inhomogeneous universe in an AdS landscape, and find that large inhomogeneity of scalar field can develop into not only sphere-like bubbles, but also novel tube-like structures. It is observed that the bubble or tube wall (across the potential barrier) likely inflates as a quasi-dS space, while the different regions separated by the walls are in different AdS vacua and will collapse towards singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Boltzmann theory to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to $g^{xy}$ component of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions.In this first part we introduce the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces of distributions. These spaces will serve the basis to understand the Schr\"odinger and Holomorphic pictures, over arbitrary Cauchy hypersurfaces, using tools of Hida-Malliavin calculus. Here the Wiener-Ito decomposition theorem provides the QFT particle interpretation. Special emphasis is done in the applications to quantization of these tools in the second part of this paper. We devote a section to introduce Hida test functions as a notion of second quantized test functions. We also analyze of the ingredients of classical field theory modeled as distributions paving the way for quantization procedures that will be analyzed in the second part of this series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering ($1+1$)-dimensional fluid in presence of gravitational trace anomaly, as an effective description of higher-dimensional fluid, the hydrodynamics is discussed through a first order thermodynamic description. Contrary to the existing approaches which are second order in nature, the fluid velocity is identified through the auxiliary field required to describe the Polyakov action for the effective description of relevant energy-momentum tensor. The thermodynamic and fluid quantities, on a static black hole spacetime, are calculated both near the horizon as well as at the asymptotic infinity. The Unruh vacuum appears to be suitable one for the present analysis, in contrast to Israel-Hartle-Hawking vacuum which is consistent with second order description. As in anomaly cancellation approach to find the Hawking flux the Unruh vacuum is consistent with the required conditions, in reverse way we interpret this fluid description as an alternative approach to find these required conditions to calculate the same in anomaly cancellation approach.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear character of general relativity leaves its imprint in the coalescence of two black holes, from the inspiral to the final ringdown stage. To quantify the impact of nonlinearities, we work at second order in black hole perturbation theory and we study the excitation of second-order modes relative to the first-order modes that drive them as we vary the black hole spin and the initial data for the perturbations. The relative amplitude of second-order modes is only mildly dependent on the initial data that we consider, but it strongly decreases for large black hole spins. This implies that the extrapolation of calculations based on the Kerr-CFT correspondence to subextremal Kerr black holes should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of uniform rate inflation on the brane. The potential is given by a hyperbolic cosine function plus a negative cosmological constant. The equation of motion is solved analytically without using slow-roll approximation. The result is that the inflaton field is rolling at a constant speed. The prediction for cosmological perturbations depends on the field value at the end of inflation. The experimental constraints could be satisfied in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Size Winding Mechanism beyond Maximal Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of information scrambling elucidates the dispersion of local information in quantum many-body systems, offering insights into various physical phenomena such as wormhole teleportation. This phenomenon has spurred extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. Among these, the size-winding mechanism emerges as a valuable diagnostic tool for optimizing signal detection. In this work, we establish a computational framework for determining the winding size distribution in large-$N$ quantum systems with all-to-all interactions, utilizing the scramblon effective theory. We obtain the winding size distribution for the large-$q$ SYK model across the entire time domain. Notably, we unveil that the manifestation of size winding results from a universal phase factor in the scramblon propagator, highlighting the significance of the Lyapunov exponent. These findings contribute to a sharp and precise connection between operator dynamics and the phenomenon of wormhole teleportation.</description>

      <title>Consistent inclusion of fluctuations in first-order causal and stable relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory for linear stochastic fluctuations, which is proved to be mathematically consistent, causal, and covariantly stable. The Martin-Siggia-Rose action is shown to be bilocal in most cases, and the noise is not white. The presence of nonhydrodynamic modes induces long-range correlations in the primary fluid variables (temperature, chemical potential, and flow velocity). However, correlators of conserved densities remain localized in space, and coincide with those calculated within fluctuating Isreal-Stewart theory. We show that, in some cases, there is a nonlocal change of variables that maps the Israel-Stewart action into the BDNK action.</description>

      <title>Geometric flavours of Quantum Field theory on a Cauchy hypersurface. Part II: Methods of quantization and evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers we aim to provide a mathematically comprehensive framework to the Hamiltonian pictures of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. Our final goal is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the theory from the point of differential geometry in infinite dimensions. In this second part we use the tools of Gaussian analysis in infinite dimensional spaces introduced in the first part to describe rigorously the procedures of geometric quantization in the space of Cauchy data of a scalar theory. This leads us to discuss and establish relations between different pictures of QFT. We also apply these tools to describe the geometrization of the space of pure states of quantum field theory as a Kh\"aler manifold. We use this to derive an evolution equation that preserves the geometric structure and avoids norm losses in the evolution. This leads us to a modification of the Schr\"odinger equation via a quantum connection that we discuss and exemplify in a simple case.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity and the 4-Point Vertices in the Constructive Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a complete set of 4-point vertices in the Constructive Standard Model (CSM). This set is smaller than in Feynman diagrams as the CSM does not need or allow any additional 4-point vertices (or contact terms) beyond what is present in Feynman diagrams and, furthermore, it does not need or allow a 4-point vertex for A,Z,W+,W- or A,A,W+,W-, in addition to the already known absence of the 4-gluon vertex. We show that with this set of 4-point vertices, perturbative unitarity is satisfied in the CSM. Additionally, we show that many constructive diagrams are not Feynman diagrams rewritten in spinor form. In fact, we show that there is a significant rearrangement of contributions from the diagrams in constructive calculations relative to Feynman diagrams, for some processes. In addition to the already known or expected rearrangement in diagrams involving external photons, we also find that diagrams involving a 4-vector-boson vertex are also significantly different than their Feynman counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in gauge theories is expected to provide insights into many fundamental phenomena, including confinement. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. In this work we study lattice gauge theories that admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In the first part of this work, we explicitly perform the duality transformation in a replica geometry, deriving the structure of a replica space for a gauge theory. Then, in the second part, we calculate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the entropic c-function of the $\Z_2$ gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions, exploiting its dual description in terms of the three-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $A_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $N=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $A_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $A_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $A_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) for open quantum systems interacting with a dissipative environment and apply it to the spin-boson model as an archetypical example where the environment is composed of a bosonic bath. Prior SKFT developments of this type have been confined to the Markovian regime, as an alternative to a conventional description by the Lindblad quantum master equation (QME) which is a time-local matrix differential equation. Here we combine SKFT with a two-particle irreducible (2PI) action that resums a class of Feynman diagrams to infinite order. We obtain the time-evolution of the spin density matrix in the form of a system of integro-differential equations applicable to both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. The latter regime--where taking into account memory effects becomes essential--poses a challenge for standard methods when trying to incorporate arbitrary properties of the system, bath, and length of time evolution. The SKFT+2PI-computed time evolution of the spin expectation values in the Markovian regime reproduces the solution of the Lindblad QME, as long as the system-bath coupling in the latter is adjusted by increasing it. In the non-Markovian regime, SKFT+2PI yields a nonperturbative solution that mimics results from both hierarchical equations of motion and tensor networks methods that we employ as benchmarks. Our SKFT+2PI approach can also access challenging cases, such as zero-temperature and sub-Ohmic bath, as well as arbitrary long evolution times. Taking into account favorable numerical cost of solving the integro-differential equations with increasing number of spins, time steps or dimensionality the SKFT+2PI approach offers a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and spintronics in the presence of a variety of (single or multiple) dissipative environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inspiral merger time for two black holes captured into a nonrelativistic bound orbit by gravitational radiation emission has been often calculated by a formula of Peters that assumes the adiabatic approximation that the changes per orbit are small. However, initially this is not true for the semimajor axis and period of most of the initially highly eccentric orbits, which change significantly during closest approach and much less elsewhere along the orbit. This effect can make the merger time much longer (using other formulas from Peters that do not assume the adiabatic approximation) than that calculated by the adiabatic formula of Peters.</description>

      <title>Necessity of Quantizable Geometry for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Dirac Quantization of $3D$ gravity in the first-order formalism is attempted where instead of quantizing the connection and triad fields, the connection and the triad 1-forms themselves are quantized. The exterior derivative operator on the space of differential forms is treated as the `time' derivative to compute the momenta conjugate to these 1-forms. This manner of quantization allows one to compute the transition amplitude in $3D$ gravity which has a close, but not exact, match with the transition amplitude computed via LQG techniques. This inconsistency is interpreted as being due to the non-quantizable nature of differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetry and Exotic Hall Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fractionalization of non-invertible symmetry in (2+1)D topological orders. We focus on coset non-invertible symmetries obtained by gauging non-normal subgroups of invertible $0$-form symmetries. These symmetries can arise as global symmetries in quantum spin liquids, given by the quotient of the projective symmetry group by a non-normal subgroup as invariant gauge group. We point out that such coset non-invertible symmetries in topological orders can exhibit symmetry fractionalization: each anyon can carry a "fractional charge" under the coset non-invertible symmetry given by a gauge invariant superposition of fractional quantum numbers. We present various examples using field theories and quantum double lattice models, such as fractional quantum Hall systems with charge conjugation symmetry gauged and finite group gauge theory from gauging a non-normal subgroup. They include symmetry enriched $S_3$ and $O(2)$ gauge theories. We show that such systems have a fractionalized continuous non-invertible coset symmetry and a well-defined electric Hall conductance. The coset symmetry enforces a gapless edge state if the boundary preserves the continuous non-invertible symmetry. We propose a general approach for constructing coset symmetry defects using a "sandwich" construction: non-invertible symmetry defects can generally be constructed from an invertible defect sandwiched by condensation defects. The anomaly free condition for finite coset symmetry is also identified.</description>

Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Non-circular Deviation from the Kerr Paradigm and Its Observational Signatures: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals and Lense-Thirring Effect</title>

Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations and shadow imaging have demonstrated the astonishing consistency of the Kerr paradigm despite all the special symmetries assumed in deriving the Kerr metric. Hence, it is crucial to test the presence of these symmetries in astrophysical scenarios and constraint possible deviations from them, especially in strong field regimes. With this motivation, the present work aims to investigate the theoretical consequences and observational signatures of non-circularity in a unified theory-agnostic manner. For this purpose, we construct a general non-circular metric with a small parameterized deviation from Kerr. This metric preserves the other properties of Kerr, such as stationarity, axisymmetry, asymptotic flatness, and the equatorial reflection symmetry. Apart from the resulting mathematical simplifications, this assumption is crucial to disentangle the consequences of relaxing circularity from other properties. Then, after discussing various novel theoretical consequences, we perform a detailed analysis of extreme mass ratio inspirals and Lense-Thirring precession in the context of this newly constructed metric. Our study clearly shows the promising prospects of detecting and constraining even a slight non-circular deviation from the Kerr paradigm using the future gravitational wave observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.</description>

      <title>Magnetization without spin: effective Lagrangian of itinerant electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discretized version of the sigma-model with supersphere target space $OSp(N+2m|2m)/OSp(N+2m-1|2m)$ and present a preliminary numerical study of bosonic and fermionic two-point functions for the cases $OSp(3|2)$ and $OSp(5|2)$. We observe consistency with the expectations of this supersymmetric setup and discuss the sign problem.</description>
