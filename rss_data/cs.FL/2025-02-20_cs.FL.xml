      <title>The rIC3 Hardware Model Checker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present rIC3, an efficient bit-level hardware model checker primarily based on the IC3 algorithm. It boasts a highly efficient implementation and integrates several recently proposed optimizations, such as the specifically optimized SAT solver, dynamically adjustment of generalization strategies, and the use of predicates with internal signals, among others. As a first-time participant in the Hardware Model Checking Competition, rIC3 was independently evaluated as the best-performing tool, not only in the bit-level track but also in the word-level bit-vector track through bit-blasting. Our experiments further demonstrate significant advancements in both efficiency and scalability. rIC3 can also serve as a backend for verifying industrial RTL designs using SymbiYosys. Additionally, the source code of rIC3 is highly modular, with the IC3 algorithm module being particularly concise, making it an academic platform that is easy to modify and extend.</description>

      <title>Reachability in 3-VASS is Elementary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reachability problem in 3-dimensional vector addition systems with states (3-VASS) is known to be PSpace-hard, and to belong to Tower. We significantly narrow down the complexity gap by proving the problem to be solvable in doubly-exponential space. The result follows from a new upper bound on the length of the shortest path: if there is a path between two configurations of a 3-VASS then there is also one of at most triply-exponential length. We show it by introducing a novel technique of approximating the reachability sets of 2-VASS by small semi-linear sets.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Implementability of Global Protocols with Infinite States and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the implementability problem for an expressive class of symbolic communication protocols involving multiple participants. Our symbolic protocols describe infinite states and data values using dependent refinement predicates. Implementability asks whether a global protocol specification admits a distributed, asynchronous implementation, namely one for each participant, that is deadlock-free and exhibits the same behavior as the specification. We provide a unified explanation of seemingly disparate sources of non-implementability through a precise semantic characterization of implementability for infinite protocols. Our characterization reduces the problem of implementability to (co)reachability in the global protocol restricted to each participant. This compositional reduction yields the first sound and relatively complete algorithm for checking implementability of symbolic protocols. We use our characterization to show that for finite protocols, implementability is co-NP-complete for explicit representations and PSPACE-complete for symbolic representations. The finite, explicit fragment subsumes a previously studied fragment of multiparty session types for which our characterization yields a co-NP decision procedure, tightening a prior PSPACE upper bound.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hostadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's G function is recursively defined via G(0) = 0 and then G(n) = n -G(G(n -1)). Following Hofstadter, a family (F\_k) of similar functions is obtained by varying the number k of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions F\_k . In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions F k are acting as right shifts of the digits. The Fibonacci-like sequences are then expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial X^k -X^(k-1) -1. Thanks to that, we estimate the discrepancy of each function F\_k , i.e., the maximal distance between F\_k and its linear equivalent. This discrepancy is finite exactly when k $\le$ 4. This also solves some related questions, in particular two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions F\_3 and F\_4 are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover F\_k can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when k $\le$ 2, while F\_k is almost additive exactly when k $\le$ 4. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of F\_3 .</description>
