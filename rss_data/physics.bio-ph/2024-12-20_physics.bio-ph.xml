      <title>Glandular Trichome Rupture in Tomato Plants is an Ultra-Fast &amp; Sensitive Defense Mechanism Against Insects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trichomes, specialized hair-like structures on the surfaces of many plants, play a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects. We investigated the biomechanics of type VI glandular trichomes in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its wild relative (Solanum habrochaites). Using micropipette force sensors and high-speed imaging, we uncovered the rupture mechanics underlying gland bursting, highlighting the small forces and short time-scales involved in this process. Additionally, we observed larvae of the Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a major pest in tomato cultivation, inadvertently triggering trichome rupture and accumulating glandular secretions on their bodies. These findings demonstrate how rapid gland bursting and the fluid dynamics of glandular secretions act as an efficient and swift plant defense mechanism against insect herbivory.</description>

      <title>Determining the Role of Electrostatics in the Making and Breaking of the Caprin1-ATP Nanocondensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a multiscale computational approach to investigate the condensation process of the C-terminal low-complexity region of the Caprin1 protein as a function of increasing ATP concentration for three states: the initial mixed state, nanocondensate formation, and the dissolution of the droplet as it reenters the mixed state. We show that upon condensation ATP assembles via pi-pi interactions, resulting in the formation of a large cluster of stacked ATP molecules stabilized by sodium counterions. The surface of the ATP assembly interacts with the arginine-rich regions of the Caprin1 protein, particularly with its N-terminus, to promote the complete phase-separated droplet on a lengthscale of tens of nanometers. In order to understand droplet stability, we analyze the near-surface electrostatic potential (NS-ESP) of Caprin1 and estimate the zeta potential of the Caprin1-ATP assemblies. We predict a positive NS-ESP at the Caprin1 surface for low ATP concentrations that defines the early mixed state, in excellent agreement with the NS-ESP obtained from NMR experiments using paramagnetic resonance enhancement. By contrast, the NS-ESP of Caprin1 at the surface of the nanocondensate at moderate levels of ATP is highly negative compared to the mixed state, and estimates of a large zeta potential outside the highly dense region of charge further explains the remarkable stability of this phase separated droplet assembly. As ATP concentrations rise further, the strong electrostatic forces needed for nanocondensate stability are replaced by weaker Caprin1-ATP interactions that drive the reentry into the mixed state that exhibits a much lower zeta potential.</description>

      <title>Dual Photonics Probing of Nano- to Submicron-Scale Structural Alterations in Human Brain Tissues or Cells and Chromatin or DNA with the Progression of Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding alterations in structural disorders in tissue or cells or building blocks, such as DNA or chromatin in the human brain, at the nano to submicron level provides us with efficient biomarkers for Alzheimers detection. Here, we report a dual photonics technique to detect nano- to submicron-scale alterations in brain tissues or cells and DNA or chromatin due to the early to late progression of Alzheimers disease in humans. Using a recently developed mesoscopic light transport technique, fine-focused nano-sensitive partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), we measure the degree of structural disorder in tissues. Furthermore, the chemical-specific inverse participation ratio technique (IPR) was used to measure the DNA or chromatin structural alterations. The results of the PWS and IPR experiments showed a significant increase in the degree of structural disorder at the nano to submicron scale at different stages of AD relative to their controls for both the tissue or cell and DNA cellular levels. The increase in the structural disorder in cells or tissues and DNA or chromatin in the nuclei can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations in the tissue and DNA or chromatin damage in the nuclei caused by the rearrangements of macromolecules due to the deposition of the amyloid beta protein and damage in DNA or chromatin with the progress of AD.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical non-Gaussian behavior in fractional Laplace motion with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractional Laplace motion (FLM) obtained from subordination of fractional Brownian motion to a gamma process, in the presence of an external drift that acts on the composite process or of an internal drift acting solely on the parental process. We derive the statistical properties of this FLM process and find that the external drift does not influence the mean-squared displacement (MSD), whereas the internal drift leads to normal diffusion, dominating at long times in the subdiffusive Hurst exponent regime. We also investigate the intricate properties of the probability density function (PDF), demonstrating that it possesses a central Gaussian region, whose expansion in time is influenced by FBM's Hurst exponent. Outside of this region the PDF follows a non-Gaussian pattern. The kurtosis of this FLM process converges toward the Gaussian limit at long times insensitive to the extreme non-Gaussian tails. Additionally, in the presence of the external drift, the PDF remains symmetric and centered at $x=vt$. In contrast, for the internal drift this symmetry is broken. The results of our computer simulations are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The FLM model is suitable for describing stochastic processes with a non-Gaussian PDF and long-ranged correlations of the motion.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>

      <title>Hair cells in the cochlea must tune resonant modes to the edge of instability without destabilizing collective modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound produces surface waves along the cochlea's basilar membrane. To achieve the ear's astonishing frequency resolution and sensitivity to faint sounds, dissipation in the cochlea must be canceled via active processes in hair cells, effectively bringing the cochlea to the edge of instability. But how can the cochlea be globally tuned to the edge of instability with only local feedback? To address this question, we use a discretized version of a standard model of basilar membrane dynamics, but with an explicit contribution from active processes in hair cells. Surprisingly, we find the basilar membrane supports two qualitatively distinct sets of modes: a continuum of localized modes and a small number of collective extended modes. Localized modes sharply peak at their resonant position and are largely uncoupled. As a result, they can be amplified almost independently from each other by local hair cells via feedback reminiscent of self-organized criticality. However, this amplification can destabilize the collective extended modes; avoiding such instabilities places limits on possible molecular mechanisms for active feedback in hair cells. Our work illuminates how and under what conditions individual hair cells can collectively create a critical cochlea.</description>

      <title>The matter/life nexus in biological cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for what differentiates inanimate matter from living things began in antiquity as a search for a "fundamental life force" embedded deep within living things - a special material unit owned only by life - later transforming to more circumspect search for unique gains in function that transform nonliving matter to that which can reproduce, adapt, and survive. Aristotelian thinking about the matter/life distinction and Vitalistic philosophy's "vital force" persisted well into the Scientific Revolution, only to be debunked by Pasteur and Brown in the 19th century. Acceptance of the atomic reality and understanding of the uniqueness of life's heredity, evolution, and reproduction led to formation of the Central Dogma. With startling speed, technological development then gave rise to structural biology, systems biology, and synthetic biology - and a search to replicate and synthesize that "gain in function" that transforms matter to life. Yet one still cannot build a living cell de novo from its atomic and molecular constituents, and "that which I cannot create, I do not understand". In the last two decades, new recognition of old ideas - spatial organization and compartmentalization - have renewed focus on Brownian and flow physics. In this Review, we explore how experimental and computational advances in the last decade have embraced the deep coupling between physics and cellular biochemistry to shed light on the matter/life nexus. Whole-cell modeling and synthesis are offering promising new insights that may shed light on this nexus in the cell's watery, crowded milieu.</description>

Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Multiple Pareto-optimal solutions of the dissipation-adaptation trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptation refers to the ability to recover and maintain ``normal'' function upon perturbations of internal or external conditions and is essential for sustaining life. Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they require a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via evolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into highly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two quantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and the thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where improving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer unique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable protocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another. Here we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a cellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network. We find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions, implying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the implications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may endow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and adapt to different environments.</description>
