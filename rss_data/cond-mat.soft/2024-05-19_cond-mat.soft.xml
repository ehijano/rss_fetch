      <title>Non-reciprocal breathing solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They manifest themselves in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation upon reachin a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Anomalous relaxation of coarsening foams with viscoelastic continuous phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultraslow structural relaxation of ageing foams with rheologically-tunable continuous phases. We probe the bubble dynamics associated with pressure-driven foam coarsening using differential dynamic microscopy, which allows characterizing the sample dynamics in the reciprocal space with imaging experiments. Similar to other out-of-equilibrium jammed soft systems, these foams exhibit compressed exponential relaxations, with a ballistic-like linear dependency of the relaxation rate on the scattering wavevector. By tuning the rheology of the continuous phase we observe changes in the relaxation shape, where stiffer matrices yield larger compressing exponents. Our results corroborate recent real-space observations obtained with bubble tracking, providing a comprehensive overview of structural relaxation in these complex systems, both in direct and reciprocal space.</description>

      <title>Constraining the value of the dielectric constant of the ferroelectric nematic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are currently being subject to a plethora of investigations since they are of great fundamental interest and could potentially foster promising applications. However, many basic aspects are still poorly understood, among which the problem of the dielectric constant stands out. Ferroelectric nematics exhibit giant dielectric constants whose value depends on the thickness of the measurement cell. Even though this must be the result of a spurious artifact, the intrinsic permittivity has not been determined yet. In this work, we tackle this problem by modeling the dielectric response of the liquid crystal filled cell through an equivalent circuit accounting for polarization reorientation and the effect of insulating interfacial layers. We arrive at the conclusion that the perpendicular component of the permittivity $\varepsilon_{\perp}$ is of the order of $10$ in the prototypical ferroelectric nematogen DIO, while the parallel component $\varepsilon_{\parallel}$ is of the order of $150$. In this way, the dielectric tensor of DIO has been fully determined.</description>

      <title>"Hall" transport of liquid crystal solitons in Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology establishes a unifying framework for a diverse range of scientific areas including particle physics, cosmology, and condensed matter physics. One of the most fascinating manifestations of topology in the context of condensed matter is the topological Hall effect, and its relative: the Skyrmion Hall effect. Skyrmions are stable vortex-like spin configurations in certain chiral magnets, and when subject to external electric currents can drift in the transverse direction to the current. These quasi-particles are characterised by a conserved topological charge which in the Skyrmion Hall effect plays the role of electric charges in the ordinary Hall effect. Recently, it has been shown that liquid crystals endowed with chiral properties serve as an ideal testbed for the fundamental investigation of topological solitons, including their two- and three-dimensional realisations. Here, we show experimentally and numerically that three-dimensional solitons aka "torons" exhibit a Hall-like effect when driven by shear flows: the torons are deflected in the direction perpendicular to the shear plane. The experimental results are rationalised in terms of the dynamic Ericksen-Leslie equations, which predict the emergence of the transverse component of the net mass flow, the magnitude of which scales as the 3rd power of the shear rate. The perturbation analysis highlights an interplay of the viscous and chiral elastic torques as the mechanism for the emergence of net transverse currents. Numerical simulations demonstrate, however, that torons are not merely dragged by the flow but move with their own transverse speed, much larger than the average flow velocity in the transverse direction. Our findings may enable responsive microfluidic applications relying on soft topological solitons.</description>

      <title>Rheology of moderated dilute suspensions of star colloids: the shape factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star colloids are rigid particles with long and slender arms connected to a central core. We show numerically that the colloid shapes control the rheology of their suspensions. In particular, colloids with curved arms and hooks can entangle with neighbor particles and form large clusters that can sustain high stresses. When a large cluster permeates the whole system the viscosity increases many fold. Contrary to the case of spherical colloids we observe that these effects are very strong even at moderate volumes fraction over a wide range of P\'eclet numbers.</description>

      <title>Brownian yet Non-Gaussian Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a Brownian heat engine working in a heterogeneous thermal bath where the mobility fluctuates. Brownian particle is trapped by the time-dependent harmonic potential, by changing the stiffness coefficient and the bath temperatures, we perform a Stirling cycle. We numerically evaluated the average work, power and efficiency. We compare our results with the Brownian heat engine working in a homogeneous thermal bath. We find that for the normal diffusive system, the performance of a Gaussian heat engine serves as an upper bound. We also observe that the non-Gaussian position distribution decreases the stochastic heat engine performance.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>
