      <title>Towards an Ethical and Inclusive Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Organizations: A Multidimensional Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyzes the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on contemporary society and the importance of adopting an ethical approach to its development and implementation within organizations. It examines the technocritical perspective of some philosophers and researchers, who warn of the risks of excessive technologization that could undermine human autonomy. However, the article also acknowledges the active role that various actors, such as governments, academics, and civil society, can play in shaping the development of AI aligned with human and social values.
  A multidimensional approach is proposed that combines ethics with regulation, innovation, and education. It highlights the importance of developing detailed ethical frameworks, incorporating ethics into the training of professionals, conducting ethical impact audits, and encouraging the participation of stakeholders in the design of AI.
  In addition, four fundamental pillars are presented for the ethical implementation of AI in organizations: 1) Integrated values, 2) Trust and transparency, 3) Empowering human growth, and 4) Identifying strategic factors. These pillars encompass aspects such as alignment with the company's ethical identity, governance and accountability, human-centered design, continuous training, and adaptability to technological and market changes.
  The conclusion emphasizes that ethics must be the cornerstone of any organization's strategy that seeks to incorporate AI, establishing a solid framework that ensures that technology is developed and used in a way that respects and promotes human values.</description>

      <title>FSM Builder: A Tool for Writing Autograded Finite Automata Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs) are abstract models of computation commonly taught in introductory computing theory courses. These models have important applications (such as fast regular expression matching), and are used to introduce formal language theory. Undergraduate students often struggle with understanding these models at first, due to the level of abstraction. As a result, various pedagogical tools have been developed to allow students to practice with these models. We introduce the FSM Builder, a new pedagogical tool enabling students to practice constructing DFAs and NFAs with a graphical editor, giving personalized feedback and partial credit. The algorithms used for generating these are heavily inspired by previous works. The key advantages to its competitors are greater flexibility and scalability. This is because the FSM Builder is implemented using efficient algorithms from an open source package, allowing for easy extension and question creation. We discuss the implementation of the tool, how it stands out from previous tools, and takeaways from experiences of using the tool in multiple large courses. Survey results indicate the interface and feedback provided by the tool were useful to students.</description>

      <title>Crafting Tomorrow's Evaluations: Assessment Design Strategies in the Era of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GenAI has gained the attention of a myriad of users in almost every profession. Its advancement has had an intense impact on education, significantly disrupting the assessment design and evaluation methodologies. Despite the potential benefits and possibilities of GenAI in the education sector, there are several concerns primarily centred around academic integrity, authenticity, equity of access, assessment evaluation methodology, and feedback. Consequently, academia is encountering challenges in assessment design that are essential to retaining academic integrity in the age of GenAI. In this article, we discuss the challenges, and opportunities that need to be addressed for the assessment design and evaluation. The article also highlights the importance of clear policy about the usage of GenAI in completing assessment tasks, and also in design approaches to ensure academic integrity and subject learning. Additionally, this article also provides assessment categorisation based on the use of GenAI to cultivate knowledge among students and academic professionals. It also provides information on the skills necessary to formulate and articulate problems and evaluate the task, enabling students and academics to effectively utilise GenAI tools.</description>

      <title>Real Risks of Fake Data: Synthetic Data, Diversity-Washing and Consent Circumvention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning systems require representations of the real world for training and testing - they require data, and lots of it. Collecting data at scale has logistical and ethical challenges, and synthetic data promises a solution to these challenges. Instead of needing to collect photos of real people's faces to train a facial recognition system, a model creator could create and use photo-realistic, synthetic faces. The comparative ease of generating this synthetic data rather than relying on collecting data has made it a common practice. We present two key risks of using synthetic data in model development. First, we detail the high risk of false confidence when using synthetic data to increase dataset diversity and representation. We base this in the examination of a real world use-case of synthetic data, where synthetic datasets were generated for an evaluation of facial recognition technology. Second, we examine how using synthetic data risks circumventing consent for data usage. We illustrate this by considering the importance of consent to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's regulation of data collection and affected models. Finally, we discuss how these two risks exemplify how synthetic data complicates existing governance and ethical practice; by decoupling data from those it impacts, synthetic data is prone to consolidating power away those most impacted by algorithmically-mediated harm.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Autonomous Weapons Risk Geopolitical Instability and Threaten AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent embrace of machine learning (ML) in the development of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) creates serious risks to geopolitical stability and the free exchange of ideas in AI research. This topic has received comparatively little attention of late compared to risks stemming from superintelligent artificial general intelligence (AGI), but requires fewer assumptions about the course of technological development and is thus a nearer-future issue. ML is already enabling the substitution of AWS for human soldiers in many battlefield roles, reducing the upfront human cost, and thus political cost, of waging offensive war. In the case of peer adversaries, this increases the likelihood of "low intensity" conflicts which risk escalation to broader warfare. In the case of non-peer adversaries, it reduces the domestic blowback to wars of aggression. This effect can occur regardless of other ethical issues around the use of military AI such as the risk of civilian casualties, and does not require any superhuman AI capabilities. Further, the military value of AWS raises the specter of an AI-powered arms race and the misguided imposition of national security restrictions on AI research. Our goal in this paper is to raise awareness among the public and ML researchers on the near-future risks posed by full or near-full autonomy in military technology, and we provide regulatory suggestions to mitigate these risks. We call upon AI policy experts and the defense AI community in particular to embrace transparency and caution in their development and deployment of AWS to avoid the negative effects on global stability and AI research that we highlight here.</description>

      <title>A comparison of online search engine autocompletion in Google and Baidu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Online search engine auto-completions make it faster for users to search and access information. However, they also have the potential to reinforce and promote stereotypes and negative opinions about a variety of social groups. We study the characteristics of search auto-completions in two different linguistic and cultural contexts: Baidu and Google. We find differences between the two search engines in the way they suppress or modify original queries, and we highlight a concerning presence of negative suggestions across all social groups. Our study highlights the need for more refined, culturally sensitive moderation strategies in current language technologies.</description>

      <title>The AI Review Lottery: Widespread AI-Assisted Peer Reviews Boost Paper Scores and Acceptance Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Journals and conferences worry that peer reviews assisted by artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, large language models (LLMs), may negatively influence the validity and fairness of the peer-review system, a cornerstone of modern science. In this work, we address this concern with a quasi-experimental study of the prevalence and impact of AI-assisted peer reviews in the context of the 2024 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), a large and prestigious machine-learning conference. Our contributions are threefold. Firstly, we obtain a lower bound for the prevalence of AI-assisted reviews at ICLR 2024 using the GPTZero LLM detector, estimating that at least $15.8\%$ of reviews were written with AI assistance. Secondly, we estimate the impact of AI-assisted reviews on submission scores. Considering pairs of reviews with different scores assigned to the same paper, we find that in $53.4\%$ of pairs the AI-assisted review scores higher than the human review ($p = 0.002$; relative difference in probability of scoring higher: $+14.4\%$ in favor of AI-assisted reviews). Thirdly, we assess the impact of receiving an AI-assisted peer review on submission acceptance. In a matched study, submissions near the acceptance threshold that received an AI-assisted peer review were $4.9$ percentage points ($p = 0.024$) more likely to be accepted than submissions that did not. Overall, we show that AI-assisted reviews are consequential to the peer-review process and offer a discussion on future implications of current trends</description>

      <title>Mining patterns in syntax trees to automate code reviews of student solutions for programming exercises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In programming education, providing manual feedback is essential but labour-intensive, posing challenges in consistency and timeliness. We introduce ECHO, a machine learning method to automate the reuse of feedback in educational code reviews by analysing patterns in abstract syntax trees. This study investigates two primary questions: whether ECHO can predict feedback annotations to specific lines of student code based on previously added annotations by human reviewers (RQ1), and whether its training and prediction speeds are suitable for using ECHO for real-time feedback during live code reviews by human reviewers (RQ2). Our results, based on annotations from both automated linting tools and human reviewers, show that ECHO can accurately and quickly predict appropriate feedback annotations. Its efficiency in processing and its flexibility in adapting to feedback patterns can significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual feedback provisioning in educational settings.</description>

      <title>ATTAXONOMY: Unpacking Differential Privacy Guarantees Against Practical Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is a mathematical framework that is increasingly deployed to mitigate privacy risks associated with machine learning and statistical analyses. Despite the growing adoption of DP, its technical privacy parameters do not lend themselves to an intelligible description of the real-world privacy risks associated with that deployment: the guarantee that most naturally follows from the DP definition is protection against membership inference by an adversary who knows all but one data record and has unlimited auxiliary knowledge. In many settings, this adversary is far too strong to inform how to set real-world privacy parameters.
  One approach for contextualizing privacy parameters is via defining and measuring the success of technical attacks, but doing so requires a systematic categorization of the relevant attack space. In this work, we offer a detailed taxonomy of attacks, showing the various dimensions of attacks and highlighting that many real-world settings have been understudied. Our taxonomy provides a roadmap for analyzing real-world deployments and developing theoretical bounds for more informative privacy attacks. We operationalize our taxonomy by using it to analyze a real-world case study, the Israeli Ministry of Health's recent release of a birth dataset using DP, showing how the taxonomy enables fine-grained threat modeling and provides insight towards making informed privacy parameter choices. Finally, we leverage the taxonomy towards defining a more realistic attack than previously considered in the literature, namely a distributional reconstruction attack: we generalize Balle et al.'s notion of reconstruction robustness to a less-informed adversary with distributional uncertainty, and extend the worst-case guarantees of DP to this average-case setting.</description>

      <title>SUKHSANDESH: An Avatar Therapeutic Question Answering Platform for Sexual Education in Rural India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sexual education aims to foster a healthy lifestyle in terms of emotional, mental and social well-being. In countries like India, where adolescents form the largest demographic group, they face significant vulnerabilities concerning sexual health. Unfortunately, sexual education is often stigmatized, creating barriers to providing essential counseling and information to this at-risk population. Consequently, issues such as early pregnancy, unsafe abortions, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual violence become prevalent. Our current proposal aims to provide a safe and trustworthy platform for sexual education to the vulnerable rural Indian population, thereby fostering the healthy and overall growth of the nation. In this regard, we strive towards designing SUKHSANDESH, a multi-staged AI-based Question Answering platform for sexual education tailored to rural India, adhering to safety guardrails and regional language support. By utilizing information retrieval techniques and large language models, SUKHSANDESH will deliver effective responses to user queries. We also propose to anonymise the dataset to mitigate safety measures and set AI guardrails against any harmful or unwanted response generation. Moreover, an innovative feature of our proposal involves integrating ``avatar therapy'' with SUKHSANDESH. This feature will convert AI-generated responses into real-time audio delivered by an animated avatar speaking regional Indian languages. This approach aims to foster empathy and connection, which is particularly beneficial for individuals with limited literacy skills. Partnering with Gram Vaani, an industry leader, we will deploy SUKHSANDESH to address sexual education needs in rural India.</description>

      <title>On human-centred security: A new systems model based on modes and mode transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an abstract conceptual framework for analysing complex security systems using a new notion of modes and mode transitions. A mode is an independent component of a system with its own objectives, monitoring data, algorithms, and scope and limits. The behaviour of a mode, including its transitions to other modes, is determined by interpretations of the mode's monitoring data in the light of its objectives and capabilities -- these interpretations we call beliefs. We formalise the conceptual framework mathematically and, by quantifying and visualising beliefs in higher-dimensional geometric spaces, we argue our models may help both design, analyse and explain systems. The mathematical models are based on simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Task Synthesis for Elementary Visual Programming in XLogoOnline Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the XLogoOnline programming platform has gained popularity among novice learners. It integrates the Logo programming language with visual programming, providing a visual interface for learning computing concepts. However, XLogoOnline offers only a limited set of tasks, which are inadequate for learners to master the computing concepts that require sufficient practice. To address this, we introduce XLogoSyn, a novel technique for synthesizing high-quality tasks for varying difficulty levels. Given a reference task, XLogoSyn can generate practice tasks at varying difficulty levels that cater to the varied needs and abilities of different learners. XLogoSyn achieves this by combining symbolic execution and constraint satisfaction techniques. Our expert study demonstrates the effectiveness of XLogoSyn. We have also deployed synthesized practice tasks into XLogoOnline, highlighting the educational benefits of these synthesized practice tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for post-processing machine learning models so that their predictions satisfy multi-group fairness guarantees. Based on the celebrated notion of multicalibration, we introduce $(\mathbf{s},\mathcal{G}, \alpha)-$GMC (Generalized Multi-Dimensional Multicalibration) for multi-dimensional mappings $\mathbf{s}$, constraint set $\mathcal{G}$, and a pre-specified threshold level $\alpha$. We propose associated algorithms to achieve this notion in general settings. This framework is then applied to diverse scenarios encompassing different fairness concerns, including false negative rate control in image segmentation, prediction set conditional uncertainty quantification in hierarchical classification, and de-biased text generation in language models. We conduct numerical studies on several datasets and tasks.</description>

Abstract: We present an interactive Web platform that, given a directed graph, allows identifying the most relevant nodes related to a given query node. Besides well-established algorithms such as PageRank and Personalized PageRank, the demo includes Cyclerank, a novel algorithm that addresses some of their limitations by leveraging cyclic paths to compute personalized relevance scores. Our demo design enables two use cases: (a) algorithm comparison, comparing the results obtained with different algorithms, and (b) dataset comparison, for exploring and gaining insights into a dataset and comparing it with others. We provide 50 pre-loaded datasets from Wikipedia, Twitter, and Amazon and seven algorithms. Users can upload new datasets, and new algorithms can be easily added. By showcasing efficient algorithms to compute relevance scores in directed graphs, our tool helps to uncover hidden relationships within the data, which makes of it a valuable addition to the repertoire of graph analysis algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mentions of Prejudice in News Media -- An International Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has identified a post-2010 sharp increase of terms used to denounce prejudice (i.e. racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, etc.) in U.S. and U.K. news media content. Here, we extend previous analysis to an international sample of news media organizations. Thus, we quantify the prevalence of prejudice-denouncing terms and social justice associated terminology (diversity, inclusion, equality, etc.) in over 98 million news and opinion articles across 124 popular news media outlets from 36 countries representing 6 different world regions: English-speaking West, continental Europe, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Persian Gulf region and Asia. We find that the post-2010 increasing prominence in news media of the studied terminology is not circumscribed to the U.S. and the U.K. but rather appears to be a mostly global phenomenon starting in the first half of the 2010s decade in pioneering countries yet largely prevalent around the globe post-2015. However, different world regions' news media emphasize distinct types of prejudice with varying degrees of intensity. We find no evidence of U.S. news media having been first in the world in increasing the frequency of prejudice coverage in their content. The large degree of temporal synchronicity with which the studied set of terms increased in news media across a vast majority of countries raises important questions about the root causes driving this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A non-custodial wallet for digital currency: design challenges and opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a novel form of money that could be issued and regulated by central banks, offering benefits such as programmability, security, and privacy. However, the design of a CBDC system presents numerous technical and social challenges. This paper presents the design and prototype of a non-custodial wallet, a device that enables users to store and spend CBDC in various contexts. To address the challenges of designing a CBDC system, we conducted a series of workshops with internal and external stakeholders, using methods such as storytelling, metaphors, and provotypes to communicate CBDC concepts, elicit user feedback and critique, and incorporate normative values into the technical design. We derived basic guidelines for designing CBDC systems that balance technical and social aspects, and reflect user needs and values. Our paper contributes to the CBDC discourse by demonstrating a practical example of how CBDC could be used in everyday life and by highlighting the importance of a user-centred approach.</description>

      <title>Decolonial AI Alignment: Openness, Vi\'{s}e\d{s}a-Dharma, and Including Excluded Knowledges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05030</link>

Abstract: Prior work has explicated the coloniality of artificial intelligence (AI) development and deployment through mechanisms such as extractivism, automation, sociological essentialism, surveillance, and containment. However, that work has not engaged much with alignment: teaching behaviors to a large language model (LLM) in line with desired values, and has not considered a mechanism that arises within that process: moral absolutism -- a part of the coloniality of knowledge. Colonialism has a history of altering the beliefs and values of colonized peoples; in this paper, I argue that this history is recapitulated in current LLM alignment practices and technologies. Furthermore, I suggest that AI alignment be decolonialized using three forms of openness: openness of models, openness to society, and openness to excluded knowledges. This suggested approach to decolonial AI alignment uses ideas from the argumentative moral philosophical tradition of Hinduism, which has been described as an open-source religion. One concept used is vi\'{s}e\d{s}a-dharma, or particular context-specific notions of right and wrong. At the end of the paper, I provide a suggested reference architecture to work toward the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>(A)I Am Not a Lawyer, But...: Engaging Legal Experts towards Responsible LLM Policies for Legal Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of providing users with advice in a wide range of professional domains, including legal advice. However, relying on LLMs for legal queries raises concerns due to the significant expertise required and the potential real-world consequences of the advice. To explore \textit{when} and \textit{why} LLMs should or should not provide advice to users, we conducted workshops with 20 legal experts using methods inspired by case-based reasoning. The provided realistic queries ("cases") allowed experts to examine granular, situation-specific concerns and overarching technical and legal constraints, producing a concrete set of contextual considerations for LLM developers. By synthesizing the factors that impacted LLM response appropriateness, we present a 4-dimension framework: (1) User attributes and behaviors, (2) Nature of queries, (3) AI capabilities, and (4) Social impacts. We share experts' recommendations for LLM response strategies, which center around helping users identify `right questions to ask' and relevant information rather than providing definitive legal judgments. Our findings reveal novel legal considerations, such as unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, and liability for inaccurate advice, that have been overlooked in the literature. The case-based deliberation method enabled us to elicit fine-grained, practice-informed insights that surpass those from de-contextualized surveys or speculative principles. These findings underscore the applicability of our method for translating domain-specific professional knowledge and practices into policies that can guide LLM behavior in a more responsible direction.</description>

      <title>Wisdom of the Silicon Crowd: LLM Ensemble Prediction Capabilities Rival Human Crowd Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human forecasting accuracy in practice relies on the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect, in which predictions about future events are significantly improved by aggregating across a crowd of individual forecasters. Past work on the forecasting ability of large language models (LLMs) suggests that frontier LLMs, as individual forecasters, underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate. In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our preregistered main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is not statistically different from the human crowd. In exploratory analyses, we find that these two approaches are equivalent with respect to medium-effect-size equivalence bounds. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions. Moreover, in Study 2, we test whether LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) can be improved by drawing on human cognitive output. We find that both models' forecasting accuracy benefits from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by between 17% and 28%: though this leads to less accurate predictions than simply averaging human and machine forecasts. Our results suggest that LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments: via the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation. This replicates the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, and opens up their use for a variety of applications throughout society.</description>

      <title>Automated Transparency: A Legal and Empirical Analysis of the Digital Services Act Transparency Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a much awaited platforms liability reform in the European Union that was adopted on 1 November 2022 with the ambition to set a global example in terms of accountability and transparency. Among other obligations, the DSA emphasizes the need for online platforms to report on their content moderation decisions (`statements of reasons' - SoRs), which is a novel transparency mechanism we refer to as automated transparency in this study. SoRs are currently made available in the DSA Transparency Database, launched by the European Commission in September 2023. The DSA Transparency Database marks a historical achievement in platform governance, and allows investigations about the actual transparency gains, both at structure level as well as at the level of platform compliance. This study aims to understand whether the Transparency Database helps the DSA to live up to its transparency promises. We use legal and empirical arguments to show that while there are some transparency gains, compliance remains problematic, as the current database structure allows for a lot of discretion from platforms in terms of transparency practices. In our empirical study, we analyze a representative sample of the Transparency Database (131m SoRs) submitted in November 2023, to characterise and evaluate platform content moderation practices.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Differential Feature Under-reporting on Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive risk models in the public sector are commonly developed using administrative data that is more complete for subpopulations that more greatly rely on public services. In the United States, for instance, information on health care utilization is routinely available to government agencies for individuals supported by Medicaid and Medicare, but not for the privately insured. Critiques of public sector algorithms have identified such differential feature under-reporting as a driver of disparities in algorithmic decision-making. Yet this form of data bias remains understudied from a technical viewpoint. While prior work has examined the fairness impacts of additive feature noise and features that are clearly marked as missing, the setting of data missingness absent indicators (i.e. differential feature under-reporting) has been lacking in research attention. In this work, we present an analytically tractable model of differential feature under-reporting which we then use to characterize the impact of this kind of data bias on algorithmic fairness. We demonstrate how standard missing data methods typically fail to mitigate bias in this setting, and propose a new set of methods specifically tailored to differential feature under-reporting. Our results show that, in real world data settings, under-reporting typically leads to increasing disparities. The proposed solution methods show success in mitigating increases in unfairness.</description>

      <title>Careless Whisper: Speech-to-Text Hallucination Harms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-text services aim to transcribe input audio as accurately as possible. They increasingly play a role in everyday life, for example in personal voice assistants or in customer-company interactions. We evaluate Open AI's Whisper, a state-of-the-art automated speech recognition service outperforming industry competitors, as of 2023. While many of Whisper's transcriptions were highly accurate, we find that roughly 1\% of audio transcriptions contained entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio. We thematically analyze the Whisper-hallucinated content, finding that 38\% of hallucinations include explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority. We then study why hallucinations occur by observing the disparities in hallucination rates between speakers with aphasia (who have a lowered ability to express themselves using speech and voice) and a control group. We find that hallucinations disproportionately occur for individuals who speak with longer shares of non-vocal durations -- a common symptom of aphasia. We call on industry practitioners to ameliorate these language-model-based hallucinations in Whisper, and to raise awareness of potential biases amplified by hallucinations in downstream applications of speech-to-text models.</description>

      <title>Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06484v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly funding open source software (OSS) development to support software security, digital sovereignty, and national competitiveness in science and innovation, amongst others. However, little is known about how OSS developers evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks of governmental funding for OSS. This study explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, funded by public research grants, commercial sponsorship, micro-donations, and a 32 euro million grant announced in France's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn's maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions. First, it contributes empirical findings about the benefits and drawbacks of public and private funding in an impactful OSS project, and the governance protocols employed by the maintainers to balance the diverse interests of their community and funders. Second, it offers practical lessons on funding for OSS developers, governments, and companies based on the experience of scikit-learn. The paper concludes with key recommendations for practitioners and future research directions.</description>

      <title>TimeFlows: Visualizing Process Chronologies from Vast Collections of Heterogeneous Information Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many fact-finding investigations, notably parliamentary inquiries, process chronologies are created to reconstruct how a controversial policy or decision came into existence. Current approaches, like timelines, lack the expressiveness to represent the variety of relations in which historic events may link to the overall chronology. This obfuscates the nature of the interdependence among the events, and the texts from which they are distilled. Based on explorative interviews with expert analysts, we propose an extended, rich set of relationships. We describe how these can be visualized as TimeFlows. We provide an example of such a visualization by illustrating the Childcare Benefits Scandal -- an affair that deeply affected Dutch politics in recent years. This work extends the scope of existing process discovery research into the direction of unveiling non-repetitive processes from unstructured information objects.</description>

      <title>Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Contents (FAIGC): A Survey of Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), have revolutionized content production methods. These artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have become deeply embedded in various aspects of daily life and work. However, these technologies have also led to the emergence of Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (FAIGC), posing new challenges in distinguishing genuine information. It is crucial to recognize that AIGC technology is akin to a double-edged sword; its potent generative capabilities, while beneficial, also pose risks for the creation and dissemination of FAIGC. In this survey, We propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of FAIGC methods today. Next, we explore the modalities and generative technologies of FAIGC. We introduce FAIGC detection methods and summarize the related benchmark from various perspectives. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges and promising areas for future research.</description>
