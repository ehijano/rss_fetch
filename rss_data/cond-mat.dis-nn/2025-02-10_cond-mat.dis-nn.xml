      <title>Two-Dimensional Lattice-Gas Model for Methane Clathrate Hydrates: Comparative Analysis with Experiments and Three-Dimensional Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methane clathrate hydrates, particularly those with an sI structure, are significant due to their potential as energy resources and their impact on gas pipelines. In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) lattice-gas model is employed to investigate the main thermodynamic properties of methane clathrate hydrates. The proposed framework is validated through comparison with experimental data and more advanced three-dimensional (3D) simulations. Adsorption isotherms, dissociation enthalpy and phase stability of the sI structure are evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. The 2D adsorption isotherms closely align with both experimental data and 3D simulations, demonstrating the 2D model's ability to precisely represent both rigid and flexible sI structures. The dissociation enthalpy calculated using our approach (76.4 kJ/mol) excellently matches the experimental value (78 kJ/mol), confirming the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the phase diagram obtained from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation shows very good agreement with experimental data between 260 and 290 K, though deviations are observed above 290 K. These findings underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the 2D model in studying methane clathrate hydrates and suggest its potential applicability for investigating other guest species and hydrate structures.</description>

      <title>Two-Point Deterministic Equivalence for Stochastic Gradient Dynamics in Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel deterministic equivalence for the two-point function of a random matrix resolvent. Using this result, we give a unified derivation of the performance of a wide variety of high-dimensional linear models trained with stochastic gradient descent. This includes high-dimensional linear regression, kernel regression, and random feature models. Our results include previously known asymptotics as well as novel ones.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diffusion Models for Manifold Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time reversed dynamics of generative diffusion models. If the exact empirical score function is used in a regime of large dimension and exponentially large number of samples, these models are known to undergo transitions between distinct dynamical regimes. We extend this analysis and compute the transitions for an analytically tractable manifold model where the statistical model for the data is a mixture of lower dimensional Gaussians embedded in higher dimensional space. We compute the so-called speciation and collapse transition times, as a function of the ratio of manifold-to-ambient space dimensions, and other characteristics of the data model. An important tool used in our analysis is the exact formula for the mutual information (or free energy) of Generalized Linear Models.</description>

      <title>Stability of dipolar bosons in a quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic potentials and dipolar interactions each impose long-range order in quantum systems, but their interplay unlocks a rich landscape of unexplored quantum phases. In this work, we investigate how dipolar bosonic crystals respond to correlated disorder in the form of quasiperiodic potentials. Using exact numerical simulations and a suite of observables - including order parameters, energy, density distributions, and two-body coherence measures - we explore one-dimensional dipolar bosons in quasiperiodic lattices at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings. Our results reveal a complex competition between superfluid, Mott insulator, density-wave, and crystalline phases, governed by the intricate balance of dipolar interactions, kinetic energy, and disorder strength. Crucially, we identify mechanisms that influence dipolar crystals, showing their surprising robustness even in the presence of strong quasiperiodic disorder. Strikingly, we challenge previous claims by demonstrating that a kinetic crystal phase - expected to precede full crystallization - does not emerge in the ground state. Instead, its traits appear only under moderate disorder, but never fully develop, giving way to a direct transition from a charge density wave to a crystal state. These findings provide new insights into the resilience of many-body quantum phases in complex environments and pave the way for engineering exotic quantum states in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>In-context denoising with one-layer transformers: connections between attention and associative memory retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Observation of a dynamic magneto-chiral instability in photoexcited tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a system of charged chiral fermions driven out of equilibrium, an electric current parallel to the magnetic field can generate a dynamic instability by which electromagnetic waves become amplified. Whether a similar instability can occur in chiral solid-state systems remains an open question. Using time-domain terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we detect signatures of what we dub a ``dynamic magneto-chiral instability" in elemental tellurium, a structurally chiral crystal. Upon transient photoexcitation in a moderate external magnetic field, tellurium emits THz radiation consisting of coherent modes that amplify over time. An explanation for this amplification is proposed using a theoretical model based on a dynamic instability of electromagnetic waves interacting with infrared-active oscillators of impurity acceptor states in tellurium to form an amplifying polariton. Our work not only uncovers the presence of a magneto-chiral instability but also highlights its promise for THz-wave amplification in chiral materials.</description>

      <title>Field theory of non-Hermitian disordered systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermiticity and disorder gives rise to unique universality classes of Anderson transitions. Here, we develop a field-theoretical description of non-Hermitian disordered systems based on fermionic replica nonlinear sigma models. We classify the target manifolds of the nonlinear sigma models across all the 38-fold symmetry classes of non-Hermitian systems and corroborate the correspondence of the universality classes of Anderson transitions between non-Hermitian systems and Hermitized systems with additional chiral symmetry. We apply the nonlinear sigma model framework to study the spectral properties of non-Hermitian random matrices with particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Anderson transition unique to nonreciprocal disordered systems in one dimension, including the Hatano-Nelson model, originates from the competition between the kinetic and topological terms in a one-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. We also discuss the critical phenomena of non-Hermitian disordered systems with symmetry and topology in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy corner modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces across various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate the exploration of theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA for projecting hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, thus characterizing the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how PCA can be applied to explore high-dimensional binary data.</description>
