      <title>A topological analysis of the space of recipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09445</link>

Abstract: In recent years, the use of data-driven methods has provided insights into underlying patterns and principles behind culinary recipes. In this exploratory work, we introduce the use of topological data analysis, especially persistent homology, in order to study the space of culinary recipes. In particular, persistent homology analysis provides a set of recipes surrounding the multiscale "holes" in the space of existing recipes. We then propose a method to generate novel ingredient combinations using combinatorial optimization on this topological information. We made biscuits using the novel ingredient combinations, which were confirmed to be acceptable enough by a sensory evaluation study. Our findings indicate that topological data analysis has the potential for providing new tools and insights in the study of culinary recipes.</description>

      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>

      <title>Classification of differentiable structures on the non-Hausdorff line with two origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify differentiable structures on a line $\mathbb{L}$ with two origins being a non-Hausdorff but $T_1$ one-dimensional manifold obtained by ``doubling'' $0$. For $k\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ let $H$ be the group of homeomorphisms $h$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $h(0)=0$ and the restriction of $h$ to $\mathbb{R}\setminus0$ is a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism. Let also $D$ be the subgroup of $H$ consisting of $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}$ also fixing $0$. It is shown that there is a natural bijection between $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism fixing both origins) and double $D$-coset classes $D \setminus H / D = \{ D h D \mid h \in H\}$.
  Moreover, the set of all $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures on $\mathbb{L}$ (up to a $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-diffeomorphism which may also exchange origins) are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of double $(D,\pm)$-coset classes $D \setminus H^{\pm} / D = \{ D h D \cup D h^{-1} D \mid h \in H\}$.
  In particular, in contrast with the real line, the line with two origins $\mathbb{L}$ admits uncountably many pair-wise non-diffeomorphic $\mathcal{C}^{k}$-structures for each $k=1,2,\ldots,\infty$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian on digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to compute and estimate the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacians on directed graphs. We have devised a new method for computing Hodge spectra with the following two ingredients.
  (I) We have observed that the product rule does work for the so-called normalized Hodge operator, denoted by $\Delta _{p}^{(a)},$ where $a$ refers to the weight that is used to redefine the inner product in the spaces $\Omega _{p}$. This together with the K\"{u}nneth formula for product allows us to compute inductively the spectra of all normalized Hodge operators $\Delta _{p}^{(a)}$ on Cartesian powers including $n$-cubes and $n$-tori.
  (II) We relate in a certain way the spectra of $\Delta _{p}$ and $\Delta_{p}^{(a)}$ to those of operators $\mathcal{L}_{p}=\partial ^{\ast }\partial$ also acting on $\Omega _{p}$. Knowing the spectra of $\Delta_{p}^{(a)}$ for all values of $p$, we compute the spectra of $\mathcal{L}_{p} $ and then the spectra of $\Delta _{p}.$ This program yields the spectra of all operators $\Delta _{p}$ on all $n$-cubes and $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>On bi-enriched $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Lurie's definition of enriched $\infty$-categories to notions of left enriched, right enriched and bi-enriched $\infty$-categories, which generalize the concepts of closed left tensored, right tensored and bitensored $\infty$-categories and share many desirable features with them. We use bi-enriched $\infty$-categories to endow the $\infty$-category of enriched functors with enrichment that generalizes both the internal hom of the tensor product of enriched $\infty$-categories when the latter exists, and the free cocompletion under colimits and tensors. As an application we prove an end formula for morphism objects of enriched $\infty$-categories of enriched functors and compute the monad for enriched functors. We build our theory closely related to Lurie's higher algebra: we construct an enriched $\infty$-category of enriched presheaves via the enveloping tensored $\infty$-category, construct transfer of enrichment via scalar extension of bitensored $\infty$-categories, and construct enriched Kan-extensions via operadic Kan extensions. In particular, we develop an independent theory of enriched $\infty$-categories for Lurie's model of enriched $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>On rectangular Toda brackets and Oda's extension problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles \textit{N. Oda}'s extension problems for the homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the issues having eluded resolution for more than four decades. We introduce a tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups, namely, the rectangular Toda bracket, by which we are able to solve the extension problems with respect to these three homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>Topological biomarkers for real-time detection of epileptic seizures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real time seizure detection is a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience towards diagnosis and treatment's improvement of epileptic disease. We propose a real-time computational method for tracking and detection of epileptic seizures from raw neurophysiological recordings. Our mechanism is based on the topological analysis of the sliding-window embedding of the time series derived from simultaneously recorded channels. We extract topological biomarkers from the signals via the computation of the persistent homology of time-evolving topological spaces. Remarkably, the proposed biomarkers robustly captures the change in the brain dynamics during the ictal state. We apply our methods in different types of signals including scalp and intracranial electroencephalograms and magnetoencephalograms, in patients during interictal and ictal states, showing high accuracy in a range of clinical situations.</description>
