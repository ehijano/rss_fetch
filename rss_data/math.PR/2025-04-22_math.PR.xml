      <title>Asymptotics of higher-order conditional tail moments for convolution-equivalently distributed losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of higher-order conditional tail moments, which quantify the contribution of individual losses in the event of systemic collapse. The study is conducted within a framework comprising two investment portfolios experiencing dependent losses that follow convolution-equivalent distributions. The main results are encapsulated in two theorems: one addressing light-tailed losses with convolution-equivalent distributions and the other focusing on heavy-tailed losses with regularly varying distributions. Both results reveal that the asymptotic behavior remains robust regardless of the strength of dependence. Additionally, numerical simulations are performed under specific scenarios to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems and moderate deviations for additive functionals of SSEP on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) on the regular tree $\mathcal{T}_d$. A central limit theorem and a moderate deviation principle of the additive functional of the process are proved, which include the CLT and the MDP of the occupation time as special cases. A graphical representation of the SSEP plays the key role in proofs of the main results, by which we can extend the martingale decomposition formula introduced in Kipnis (1987) for the occupation time to the case of general additive functionals.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Parisi measures for enriched convex vector spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the free energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra parameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched free energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.</description>

      <title>GUE Fluctuations Near the Axis in One-Sided Ballistic Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variation of the classic ballistic deposition model in which vertically falling blocks can only stick to the top or the upper right corner of growing columns. We establish that the fluctuations of the height function at points near the $t$-axis are given by the GUE ensemble and its correspondent Tracy-Widom limiting distribution. The proof is based on a graphical construction of the process in terms of a directed Last Passage Percolation model.</description>

      <title>Stationary distributions of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with jumps: existence, uniqueness, and multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the issues on existence, uniqueness, and multiplicity of stationary distributions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with jumps. In detail, with regarding to McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by pure jump L\'{e}vy processes, we principally (i) explore the existence of stationary distributions via Schauder's fixed point theorem under an appropriate Lyapunov condition; (ii) tackle the uniqueness of stationary distributions and the convergence to the equilibria as long as the underlying drifts are continuous with respect to the measure variables under the weighted total variation distance and the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, respectively; (iii) demonstrate the multiplicity of stationary distributions under a locally dissipative condition. In addition, some illustrative examples are provided to show that the associated McKean-Vlasov SDEs possess a unique, two and three stationary distributions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Repeated singular values of a random symmetric matrix and decoupled singular value estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be a random symmetric matrix with Bernoulli $\{\pm 1\}$ entries. For any $\kappa&gt;0$ and two real numbers $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ with a separation $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|\geq \kappa n^{1/2}$ and both lying in the bulk $[-(2-\kappa)n^{1/2},(2-\kappa)n^{1/2}]$, we prove a joint singular value estimate $$ \mathbb{P}(\sigma_{min}(A_n-\lambda_i I_n)\leq\epsilon n^{-1/2};i=1,2)\leq C\epsilon^2+2e^{-cn}. $$ For general subgaussian distribution and a mesoscopic separation $|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|\geq \kappa n^{-1/2+\sigma},\sigma&gt;0$ we prove the same estimate with $e^{-cn}$ replaced by an exponential type error. This means that extreme behaviors of the least singular value at two locations can essentially be decoupled all the way down to the exponential scale when the two locations are separated. As a corollary, we prove that all the singular values of $A_n$ in $[\kappa n^{1/2},(2-\kappa)n^{1/2}]$ are distinct with probability $1-e^{-cn}$, and with high probability the minimal gap between these singular values has order at least $n^{-3/2}$. This justifies, in a strong quantitative form, a conjecture of Vu up to $(1-\kappa)$-fraction of the spectrum for any $\kappa&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many collisions between a recurrent simple random walk and arbitrary many transient random walks in a subballistic random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $d$ random walks $\big(S_n^{(j)}\big)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, $1\leq j \leq d$, in the same random environment $\omega$ in $\mathbb{Z}$, and a recurrent simple random walk $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ on $\mathbb{Z}$. We assume that, conditionally on the environment $\omega$, all the random walks are independent and start from even initial locations. Our assumption on the law of the environment is such that a single random walk in the environment $\omega$ is transient to the right but subballistic, with parameter $0&lt;\kappa&lt;1/2$. We show that - for every value of $d$ - there are almost surely infinitely many times for which all these random walks, $(Z_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $\big(S_n^{(j)}\big)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, $1\leq j \leq d$, are simultaneously at the same location, even though one of them is recurrent and the $d$ others ones are transient.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mean-field analysis of adaptive Langevin diffusions: Propagation-of-chaos and convergence of the linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an application to empirical Bayes learning in high-dimensional regression, we study a class of Langevin diffusions in a system with random disorder, where the drift coefficient is driven by a parameter that continuously adapts to the empirical distribution of the realized process up to the current time. The resulting dynamics take the form of a stochastic interacting particle system having both a McKean-Vlasov type interaction and a pairwise interaction defined by the random disorder. We prove a propagation-of-chaos result, showing that in the large system limit over dimension-independent time horizons, the empirical distribution of sample paths of the Langevin process converges to a deterministic limit law that is described by dynamical mean-field theory. This law is characterized by a system of dynamical fixed-point equations for the limit of the drift parameter and for the correlation and response kernels of the limiting dynamics. Using a dynamical cavity argument, we verify that these correlation and response kernels arise as the asymptotic limits of the averaged correlation and linear response functions of single coordinates of the system. These results enable an asymptotic analysis of an empirical Bayes Langevin dynamics procedure for learning an unknown prior parameter in a linear regression model, which we develop in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Riesz transform, function spaces and their applications on infinite dimensional compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a compact connected group $G$, consider the infinitesimal generator $-L$ of a central symmetric Gaussian convolution semigroup $(\mu_t)_{t&gt;0}$. We establish several regularity results of the solution to the Poisson equation $LU=F$, both in strong and weak senses. To this end, we introduce two classes of Lipschitz spaces for $1\le p\le \infty$: $\Lambda_{\theta}^p$, defined via the associated Markov semigroup, and $\mathrm L_{\theta}^p$, defined via the intrinsic distance. In the strong sense, we prove a priori Sobolev regularity and Lipschitz regularity in the class of $\Lambda_{\theta}^p$ space. In the distributional sense, we further show local regularity in the class of $\mathrm L_{\theta}^{\infty}$ space. These results require some strong assumptions on $-L$. Our main techniques build on the differentiability of the associated semigroup, explicit dimension-free $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) boundedness of first and second order Riesz transforms, and a comparison between the two Lipschitz norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a system consisting of several Dirac fields and a particle, we study the Cauchy problem with random initial data. We assume that the initial measure has zero mean value, a finite mean charge density, a translation-invariant covariance and satisfies a mixing condition. The main result is the long-time convergence of distributions of the random solutions to a limit Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\^{o} diffusion ${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}} t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03101v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the flow approach of Duch [Duc21] can be adapted to prove local well-posedness for the generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semi-linear equations involving smooth, non-polynomial, functions of the solution - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of elementary differentials.</description>

Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_*(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the KPZ equation in $1$ spatial dimension with noise that is rougher than white by an exponent $\gamma&gt;1/4$. Under a weak coupling limit, formally removing the nonlinearity from the equation, we show using regularity structures that the renormalised solutions converge to a Gaussian limit that is different from the solution of the linear part of the equation. The regime of this effect has a nontrivial overlap with the subcritical regime $\gamma&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Energy solutions to SDEs with supercritical distributional drift: An extension and weak convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the SDE \begin{equation} \text{d} X_t = b (t, X_t) \text{d} t + \sqrt{2} \text{d} B_t, \label{mainSDE} \end{equation} in dimension $d \geqslant 2$, where $B$ is a Brownian motion and $b : \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathcal{S}' (\mathbb{R}^d , \mathbb{R}^d)$ is distributional, scaling super-critical and satisfies $\nabla \cdot b \equiv 0$. We partially extend the super-critical weak well-posedness result for energy solutions from [GP24] by allowing a mixture of the regularity regimes treated therein: Outside of neighbourhoods of a small (and compared to [GP24] ''time-dependent'') local singularity set $K \subset \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}^d$, $b$ is assumed to be in a certain supercritical $L^q_T H^{s, p}$-type class that allows a direct link between the PDE and the energy solution from a-priori estimates up to the stopping time of visiting $K$. To establish this correspondence, and thus uniqueness, globally in time we then show that $K$ is actually never visited which requires us to impose a relation between the dimension of $K$ and the H\"older regularity of $X$. In the second part of this work we derive weak convergence rates for approximations of the above equation in the case of time-independent drift, in particular with local singularities as above.</description>

      <title>Branching random walk conditioned on large martingale limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a branching random walk in the non-boundary case where the additive martingale $W_n$ converges a.s. and in mean to some non-degenerate limit $W_\infty$. We first establish the joint tail distribution of $W_\infty$ and the global minimum of this branching random walk. Next, conditioned on the event that the minimum is atypically small or conditioned on very large $W_\infty$, we study the branching random walk viewed from the minimum and obtain the convergence in law in the vague sense. As a byproduct, we also get the right tail of the limit of derivative martingale.</description>

      <title>Real Gaussian exponential sums via a real moment map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the expected number of solutions of a system of identically distributed exponential sums with centered Gaussian coefficient and arbitrary variance. We use the Adler and Taylor theory of Gaussian random fields to identify a moment map which allows to express the expected number of solution as an integral over the Newton polytope, in analogy with the Bernstein Khovanskii Kushnirenko Theorem. We apply this result to study the monotonicity of the expected number of solution with respect to the support of the exponential sum in an open set. We find that, when a point is added in the support in the interior of the Newton polytope there exists an open sets where the expected number of solutions decreases, answering negatively to a local version of a conjecture by B\"urgisser. When the point added in the support is far enough away from the Newton polytope we show that there is an unbounded open set where the number of solution decreases. We also prove some new lower bounds for the Aronszajn multiplication of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Thorin processes and their subordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Thorin process is a stochastic process with independent and stationary increments whose laws are weak limits of finite convolutions of gamma distributions. Many popular L\'evy processes fall under this class. The Thorin class can be characterized by a representing triplet that conveys more information on the process compared to the L\'evy triplet. In this paper we investigate some relationships between the Thorin structure and the process properties, and find that the support of the Thorin measure characterizes the existence of the critical exponential moment, as well as the asymptotic equivalence between the L\'evy tail function and the complementary distribution function. Furthermore, it is illustrated how univariate Brownian subordination with respect to Thorin subordinators produces Thorin processes whose representing measure is given by a pushforward with respect to a hyperbolic function, leading to arguably easier formulae compared to the Bochner integral determining the L\'evy measure. We provide a full account of the theory of multivariate Thorin processes, starting from the Thorin--Bondesson representation for the characteristic exponent, and highlight the roles of the Thorin measure in the analysis of density functions, moments, path variation and subordination. Various old and new examples are discussed. We finally detail a treatment of subordination of gamma processes with respect to negative binomial subordinators which is made possible by the Thorin-Bondesson representation.</description>

      <title>On the log-Sobolev constant of log-concave measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a log-Sobolev inequality implies sub-gaussian decay of the tails. In the spirit of the KLS conjecture, we investigate whether this implication can be reversed under a log-concavity assumption. In the general setting, we improve on a result of Bobkov, establishing the best dimension dependent bound on the log-Sobolev constant of subgaussian log-concave measures, and we investigate some special cases.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework and Analysis for Perfect Radar Pulse Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perfect radar pulse compression coding is a potential emerging field which aims at providing rigorous analysis and fundamental limit radar experiments. It is based on finding non-trivial pulse codes, which we can make statistically equivalent, to the radar experiments carried out with elementary pulses of some shape. A common engineering-based radar experiment design, regarding pulse-compression, often omits the rigorous theory and mathematical limitations. In this work our aim is to develop a mathematical theory which coincides with understanding the radar experiment in terms of the theory of comparison of statistical experiments. We review and generalize some properties of the It\^{o} measure. We estimate the unknown i.e. the structure function in the context of Bayesian statistical inverse problems. We study the posterior for generalized $d$-dimensional inverse problems, where we consider both real-valued and complex-valued inputs for posteriori analysis. Finally this is then extended to the infinite dimensional setting, where our analysis suggests the underlying posterior is non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence of Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear programs with quadratic regularization are attracting renewed interest due to their applications in optimal transport: unlike entropic regularization, the squared-norm penalty gives rise to sparse approximations of optimal transport couplings. It is well known that the solution of a quadratically regularized linear program over any polytope converges stationarily to the minimal-norm solution of the linear program when the regularization parameter tends to zero. However, that result is merely qualitative. Our main result quantifies the convergence by specifying the exact threshold for the regularization parameter, after which the regularized solution also solves the linear program. Moreover, we bound the suboptimality of the regularized solution before the threshold. These results are complemented by a convergence rate for the regime of large regularization. We apply our general results to the setting of optimal transport, where we shed light on how the threshold and suboptimality depend on the number of data points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>Transition of $\alpha$-mixing in Random Iterations with Applications in Queuing Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear time series models with exogenous regressors are essential in econometrics, queuing theory, and machine learning, though their statistical analysis remains incomplete. Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Sampling on Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sampling in the so-called low-temperature regime, which is typically characterised by non-local behaviour and strong global correlations. Canonical examples include sampling independent sets on bipartite graphs and sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model. Low-temperature sampling is computationally intractable for general graphs, but recent advances based on the polymer method have made significant progress for graph families that exhibit certain expansion properties that reinforce the correlations, including for example expanders, lattices and dense graphs.
  One of the most natural graph classes that has so far escaped this algorithmic framework is the class of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs whose expansion only manifests for sufficiently large subsets of vertices; small sets of vertices on the other hand have vanishing expansion which makes them behave independently from the bulk of the graph and therefore weakens the correlations. At a more technical level, the expansion of small sets is crucial for establishing the Kotecky-Priess condition which underpins the applicability of the framework.
  Our main contribution is to develop the polymer method in the low-temperature regime for sparse random graphs. As our running example, we use the Potts and random-cluster models on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d=\Theta(1)$, where we show a polynomial-time sampling algorithm for all sufficiently large $q$ and $d$, at all temperatures. Our approach applies more generally for models that are monotone. Key to our result is a simple polymer definition that blends easily with the connectivity properties of the graph and allows us to show that polymers have size at most $O(\log n)$.</description>
