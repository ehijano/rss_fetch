      <title>Theoretical study on the crystal structure of a bilayer nickel-oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and analysis on the occurrence of possible unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity under high pressure with $T_c$ exceeding 80 K in a bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has led to a strong desire to realize similar high $T_c$ phenomena at ambient pressure. As one possible path toward realizing superconductivity at ambient pressure, we here propose to consider Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ as a possible candidate. In this study, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ and its structural stability. Our phonon calculation shows that this compound with the $I4/mmm$ tetragonal structure is dynamically stable even at ambient pressure. The characteristic crystal field in this compound lowers the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital energy, by which the Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital becomes rather closer to the half-filling in Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ than La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. As a result, we find that superconductivity is enhanced even though a relatively strong orbital hybridization between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals is somewhat detrimental for superconductivity. We also check the formation enthalpy, which shows that the high-pressure synthesis can be a good way to actually produce Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$. We find that Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ is a promising new candidate of bilayer-nickelate superconductors, which can possess even higher $T_c$ than pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe${}_{2}$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interests arise in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\mp id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\pm i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe${}_{2}$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of topological regime in elongated Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study topological superconductivity in elongated planar Josephson junctions. Josephson junctions host a topological phase accompanied by the presence of zero-energy Majorana-bound states in a certain region of the superconducting phase difference with a span determined by the strength of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the topological superconducting phase range can be greatly increased by elongation of the junction, which causes an amplification of the Zeeman-induced phase shift of Andreev bound states. We show that the appearance of trivial in-gap states that occurs in elongated junctions can prohibit the creation of Majorana modes, but it can be mitigated by further proximitization of the junction with additional superconducting contacts. The topological transition in this system can be probed by measurements of the critical current and we show that the elongation of the junction leads to a linear decrease of the transition critical magnetic field beneficial for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry encoded to pair potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bloch wave functions of electrons have properties called quantum geometry, which has recently attracted much attention as the origin of intriguing physical phenomena. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the quantum-geometric pair potentials (QGPP) based on the generalized band representation and thereby clarify how the quantum geometry of electrons is transferred to the Cooper pairs they form. QGPP quantifies the deviation of multiband superconductors from an assembly of single-band superconductors and has a direct connection to the quantum-geometric corrections to thermodynamic coefficients. We also discuss their potential ability to emulate exotic pair potentials and engineer intriguing superconducting phenomena including topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin supercurrent in superconductor/ferromagnet van-der-Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dissipationless spin transport induced by a charge supercurrent in a monolayer van der Waals superconductor under the applied magnetic field and in a bilayer superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) heterostructure with no external field. It is shown that in both cases a combined action of the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and the Zeeman field results in appearance of a nonunitary superconducting triplet correlations with nonzero average Cooper pair spin, which carry spin current in the presence of a condensate motion. Properties of this dissipationless spin current are investigated. In particular, it is shown that it manifests a rectification effect. In addition, in S/F heterostructures the amplitude and the sign of the spin current are controlled by gating.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing may naturally decompose into a series of weakly-coupled bilayer and trilayer superconducting blocks in order to minimize its total free energy. Our work is motivated by the recent proposal of interlayer pairing induced by the interlayer superexchange interaction of nearly half-filled $d_{z^2}$ orbitals in the bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors. We explore general properties of interlayer pairing superconductivity and perform systematic Ginzburg-Landau analyses of an effective multilayer model. For real materials, our results imply strong superconducting order parameter modulation and short coherence length along the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the layers). This reveals a unique feature of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing and provides a basic framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable giant superconducting nonreciprocal transport in few-layer $T_{\rm d}$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate gate-tunable giant field-dependent nonreciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy) in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor $T_{\rm d}$-MoTe$_2$ in the thin limit. Giant magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) with a rectification coefficient $\gamma$ = $3.1 \times 10^6$ T$^{-1}$ A$^{-1}$, is observed at 230 mK, below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). This is one of the largest values reported so far and is likely attributed to the reduced symmetry of the crystal structure. The temperature dependence of $\gamma$ indicates that the ratchet-like motion of magnetic vortices is the origin of the MCA, as supported by our theoretical model. For bilayer $T_{\rm d}$-MoTe$_2$, we successfully perform gate control of the MCA and realize threefold modulation of $\gamma$. Our experimental results provide a new route to realizing electrically controllable superconducting rectification devices in a single material.</description>
