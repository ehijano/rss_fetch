      <title>On the functional Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To every log-concave function $f$ one may associate a pair of measures $(\mu_{f},\nu_{f})$ which are the surface area measures of $f$. These are a functional extension of the classical surface area measure of a convex body, and measure how the integral $\int f$ changes under perturbations. The functional Minkowski problem then asks which pairs of measures can be obtained as the surface area measures of a log-concave function. In this work we fully solve this problem.
  Furthermore, we prove that the surface area measures are continuous in correct topology: If $f_{k}\to f$, then $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ in the appropriate sense. Finding the appropriate mode of convergence of the pairs $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)$ sheds a new light on the construction of functional surface area measures. To prove this continuity theorem we associate to every convex function a new type of radial function, which seems to be an interesting construction on its own right.
  Finally, we prove that the solution to functional Minkowski problem is continuous in the data, in the sense that if $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ then $f_{k}\to f$ up to translations.</description>

      <title>Universality of Polyhedral Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar linkages are a rich area of study motivated by practical applications in engineering mechanisms. A central result is Kempe's Universality Theorem, which states that semi-algebraic sets can be realized by planar linkages. Polyhedral linkages are generalizations of planar linkages to higher dimensions, where the faces are required to be rigid. In this paper, we generalize Kempe's Universality Theorem to polyhedral linkages with an embedded construction in dimension three and above.</description>

      <title>Napoleonic Constructions in the Hyperbolic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Euclidean setting, Napoleon's Theorem states that if one constructs an equilateral triangle on either the outside or the inside of each side of a given triangle and then connects the barycenters of those three new triangles, the resulting triangle happens to be equilateral. The case of spherical triangles has been recently shown to be different: on the sphere, besides equilateral triangles, a necessary and sufficient condition for a given triangle to enjoy the above Napoleonic property is that its congruence class should lie on a suitable surface (namely, an ellipsoid in suitable coordinates). In this article we show that the hyperbolic case is significantly different from both the Euclidean and the spherical setting. Specifically, we establish here that the hyperbolic plane does not admit any Napoleonic triangle, except the equilateral ones. Furthermore, we prove that iterated Napoleonization of any triangle causes it to become smaller and smaller, more and more equilateral and converge to a single point in the limit.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question of the optimality of Fibonacci lattices with respect to tensor product energies on the torus, most notably the periodic $L_2$-discrepancy, diaphony and the worst case error of the quasi-Monte Carlo integration over certain parametrized dominating mixed smoothness Sobolev spaces $H_p^d$ of periodic functions. We consider two methods for this question.
  First, a method based on Delsarte's LP-bound from coding theory which will give us, among others, the Fibonacci lattices as the natural candidates for optimal point sets. Second, we will adapt the continuous LP-bound on the sphere (and other spaces) to the torus to get optimality in the continuous setting.
  We conclude with a more in depth look at the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice, giving an effectively computable algorithm for checking if it is optimal and rigorously proving its optimality for quasi-Monte Carlo integration in the range $0 &lt; p \leq 11.66$. We also prove a result on the universal optimality of $3$ points in any dimension.
  The novelty of this approach is the application of LP-methods for tensor product energies in the torus and the systematic study of the simultaneous global optimality of periodic point sets for a class of tensor product potential functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Erd\H{o}s-Anning Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Anning theorem states that every point set in the Euclidean plane with integer distances must be either collinear or finite. More strongly, for any (non-degenerate) triangle of diameter~$\delta$, at most $O(\delta^2)$ points can have integer distances from all three triangle vertices. We prove the same results for any strictly convex distance function on the plane, and analogous results for every two-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold of bounded genus and for geodesic distance on the boundary of every three-dimensional Euclidean convex set. As a consequence, we resolve a 1983 question of Richard Guy on the equilateral dimension of Riemannian manifolds. Our proofs are based on the properties of additively weighted Voronoi diagrams of these distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an identity which connects the visual angle metric $v_{\mathbb{H}^2}$ and the hyperbolic metric $\rho_{\mathbb{H}^2}$ of the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. The proof is based on geometric arguments and uses computer algebra methods for formula manipulation. We also prove a sharp H\"older continuity result for quasiregular mappings with respect to the visual angle metric.</description>

      <title>Cobordism of domes over curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An integral curve is a closed piecewise linear curve comprised of unit intervals. A dome is a polyhedral surface whose faces are equilateral triangles and whose boundary is an integral curve. Glazyrin and Pak showed that not every integral curve can be domed by analyzing the case of unit rhombi, and conjectured that every integral curve is cobordant to a unit rhombus. We show that this is false for oriented domes, but that every integral curve is orientably cobordant to the union of finitely many unit rhombi.</description>

      <title>On the total surface area of potato packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if we fill without gaps a bag with infinitely many potatoes, in such a way that they touch each other in few points, then the total surface area of the potatoes must be infinite. In this context potatoes are measurable subsets of the Euclidean space, the bag is any open set of the same space. As we show, this result also holds in the general context of doubling (even locally) metric measure spaces satisfying Poincar\'e inequality, in particular in smooth Riemannian manifolds and even in some sub-Riemannian spaces.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of Euclidean distance functions from algebraic hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Y\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed definable subset and $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a smooth manifold. We construct a version of Morse Theory for the restriction to $X$ of the Euclidean distance function from $Y$. This is done using the notion of critical points of Lipschitz functions and applying the theory of continuous selections. In this theory, nondegenerate critical points have two indices: a quadratic index (as in classical Morse Theory), and a piecewise linear index (that relates to the notion of bottlenecks). This framework is flexible enough to simultaneously treat and unify the study of two cases of interest for computational algebraic geometry: bottlenecks and nearest point problems. We provide a technical toolset guaranteeing the applicability of the theory to the case where $X, Y$ are generic algebraic hypersurfaces and use it to bound the number of critical points of the distance from $Y$ restricted to $X$, among other applications.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness on average of large isoperimetric sets in noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which is not isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n$, has nonnegative Ricci curvature, Euclidean volume growth, and quadratic Riemann curvature decay. We prove that there exists a set $\mathcal{G}\subset (0,\infty)$ with density $1$ at infinity such that for every $V\in \mathcal{G}$ there is a unique isoperimetric set of volume $V$ in $M$; moreover, its boundary is strictly volume preserving stable.
  The latter result cannot be improved to uniqueness or strict stability for every large volume. Indeed, we construct a complete Riemannian surface satisfying the previous assumptions and with the following additional property: there exist arbitrarily large and diverging intervals $I_n\subset (0,\infty)$ such that isoperimetric sets with volumes $V\in I_n$ exist, but they are neither unique nor do they have strictly volume preserving stable boundaries.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>
