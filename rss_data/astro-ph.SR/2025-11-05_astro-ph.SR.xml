      <title>Effectiveness of High-Dimensional Distance Metrics on Solar Flare Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence supporting this finding.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Protostellar Variability with PRIMA Using Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that protostellar outbursts likely play a critical role in the stellar mass assembly process, but the extent of this contribution is not well understood. Using the proposed observing program of PRIMA, a concept far-IR observatory (PRIMA GO Case #43 in Moullet et al. 2023), we examine the probe's ability to unambiguously determine whether or not variable accretion events dominate the stellar mass assembly process ($M_{\rm burst}\geq0.5M_{*}$). To do this, we construct multiple protostellar ensembles using Herschel 70$\mu$m flux data and evolve them using a toy Monte Carlo simulation through steady-state and high magnitude accretion events. Ensembles are observed at various epochs in the evolution process to conclude how many large amplitude outbursts are observationally recoverable during the proposed program. Based on our synthetic observations and our simulation specifications, we determine that observing a protostellar ensemble of at least 2000 protostars using PRIMA's proposed program is sufficient for determining the importance of protostellar outbursts in the stellar mass assembly process.</description>

      <title>Decoding the RVb Enigma of DF Cyg: Pulsations, Circumstellar Disks, and Post-RGB Evolution Revealed by Multi-Wavelength Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation integrates five decades of ground-based photometric data from the AAVSO, AFOEV, ASAS, ASAS-SN, and SuperWASP surveys with recently acquired TESS observations, conducting a multi-wavelength and multi-phase photometric analysis to elucidate the complex nature of DF Cyg. For the first time, we analyze approximately four years of Kepler data alongside TESS observations. Furthermore, TESS observations obtained in 120-second cadence mode, constitute the highest-precision photometric dataset for DF Cyg to date. By isolating long-term trends in the TESS data, we quantified short-term variations in the fundamental pulsation frequency and its integer harmonics. The two alternating short-term cycles in the TESS light curve facilitated the unambiguous identification of seven previously undetected integer harmonics of the fundamental frequency in the power spectrum, providing critical new insights into the star's complex pulsation dynamics. A periodogram analysis of the combined ground- and space-based datasets revealed approximately 35 frequencies linked to both long- and short-term variability mechanisms. Stellar parameters derived from Gaia DR3 data specifically, luminosity and radius estimates based on Type II Cepheid PL and PR relations demonstrate consistency with values obtained through SED modeling. Complementary high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of DF Cyg yielded atmospheric parameters of Teff = 4781 K, logg = 1.74 dex, and [FeH] = -0.07 dex, further constraining physical characteristics of the star. This synthesis of multi-epoch, multi-instrument data advances the understanding of pulsational behavior and evolutionary status in RV Tauri systems. Our findings highlight DF Cyg as a critical benchmark for its class, as its characteristics bridge the gap between post-RGB systems in the Magellanic Clouds and higher-luminosity post-AGB stars.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between the Final Separation and Mass Ratio from Common Envelope Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical models for common envelope evolution (CEE), particularly the energy formalism, are used in binary population synthesis to predict post-CEE configurations. This formalism is based on an efficiency parameter alpha, which relates the orbital energy released during CEE to that required to unbind the envelope of the giant. However, one of the main challenges is that CEE is a multiscale, multiphysics process. As a result, there may not be a universal value for alpha, or even a general expression. Using 13 3D simulations of CEE with RGBs (1 and 2 M$_\odot$ primary; four mass ratios; with and without corotation), we present an empirical linear correlation between the post-plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant radius. This trend for the plunge-in phase of CEE persists across RGB, AGB, and supergiant simulations in the literature, even for partially bound envelopes. Therefore, alpha from simulations should not be used to predict the final separation, but rather as a diagnostic of whether sufficient orbital energy has been liberated to completely eject the envelope immediately after the radial plunge. If this condition is not met, further in-spiral is expected in later stages of CEE, which may explain why the final separation of post-CEE observations is generally smaller than those predicted by the linear fit. Our results reinforce the idea that a better description could emerge if CEE is treated as a sequence of distinct phases, rather than treating it as a single event governed by alpha.</description>

      <title>A robust method for identifying Be stars in the LAMOST Data Release 11 based on Deep-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Be stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars that exhibit Balmer emission lines in their optical spectra. These stars play an important role in studies of stellar evolution and disk structures. In this work, we carried out a systematic search for Be stars based on LAMOST spectroscopic data. Using low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR11, we constructed a data set and developed a classification model that combines long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks , achieving a testing accuracy of 97.86%. The trained model was then applied to spectra with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10, yielding 55,667 B-type candidates. With the aid of the MKCLASS automated classification tool and manual verification, we finally confirmed 40,223 B-type spectra. By cross-matching with published H{\alpha} emission-line star catalogs, we obtained a sample of 8298 Be stars, including 3787 previously reported Be stars and 4511 newly discovered. Furthermore, by incorporating color information, we classified the Be star sample into Herbig Be stars and Classical Be stars. In total, we identified 3363 Classical Be stars and 35 Herbig Be stars. The B-type and Be star catalogs derived in this study, together with the code used for model training, have been publicly released to facilitate community research.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations with the MURaM code: the Emerging Active Region Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the application of the data-driven branch of the MURaM code, which follows the evolution of the actual active region over 4 days and reproduces many key coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission features seen in remote sensing observations. Radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that account for sophisticated energy transport processes, such as those in the real corona, have been extended with the ability to use observations as time-dependent boundaries, such that the models follow the evolution of actual active regions. This opens the possibility of a one-to-one model of a target region over an extensive time period. We use a hybrid strategy that combines fast-evolving idealized zero-$\beta$ models that capture the evolution of the large-scale active region magnetic field over a long time period and sophisticated radiative MHD models for a shorter time period of interest. Synthesized EUV images illustrate the formation of coronal loops that connect the two sunspots or fan out to the domain boundary. The model reveals in three-dimensional space the finer structures in the coronal heating and plasma properties, which are usually concealed behind the EUV observables. The emission-measure-weighted line-of-sight velocity, which represents the Doppler shift of a spectral line forming in a certain temperature range, reveals vigorous dynamics in plasma at different temperatures and ubiquitous MHD waves, as expected in the real solar corona.</description>

      <title>Nominal thresholds for good astrometric fits, and prospects for binary detectability, for the full extended \textit{Gaia} mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full extended Gaia mission spans slightly over 10 years of data, whilst the current data releases represent only a fraction of that timescale (DR3, 34 months). The longer baseline improves the quality of astrometric fits, lowering the noise floor and making consistently bad fits (for example, due to binarity) more apparent. In this paper, we use simulated binaries from the Gaia Universe Model to examine the long-term astrometric behaviour of single stars and stellar binaries. We calculate nominal upper limits on the spread of goodness of astrometric fits for well-behaved single stars. Specifically, for the RUWE parameter, for upcoming DR4 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.15$) and DR5 ($\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.11$), using the full mission nominal scanning law. These can be used to identify poor astrometric fits, and in particular can flag potential binary systems. We show the increase in the number and type of binaries detectable through RUWE. With our updated RUWE thresholds, the number of detectable low-period binaries increases by 5-10% with each subsequent data release, suggesting detections may be possible for orbital periods down to days. The number of detectable long-period systems increases by 10-20%, with periods up to 100 years, causing significant deviations in low moderate-eccentricity binaries. Very eccentric systems with much longer periods (thousands of years) can still be detected if they pass through periapse during the observing window. Finally, we compare our results to the analytic estimate for the spread in UWE, which we predict from a $\chi$-distribution moderated by the number of observations. These agree with our inferred population limits but suggest that we may be biased by a small number of poorly sampled systems. In regions of the sky that are more frequently observed, lower limits could be employed, potentially bringing even more binaries above the threshold for detectability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Masses and Radiative Transfer Modeling of HD 698: a Be Binary in Evolutionary Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the early post-mass-transfer binary HD 698 (V742 Cas) combining high-resolution optical spectroscopy, long-baseline interferometry, and radiative-transfer modeling. Counter-phased radial-velocity curves yield a circular orbit with P=55.927+/-0.001 d and component masses M_Be=7.48+/-0.07 M_sun and M_comp=1.23+/-0.02 M_sun. The Be primary is traced by broad H alpha wings, while narrow metallic absorption lines arise from a slowly rotating companion. The interferometric separation implies a dynamical distance of 888+/-5 pc. The spectral energy distribution is reproduced with E(B-V)=0.321+/-0.016 and a viscous decretion disk of base density rho_0~5x10^12 g cm^-3 at r=R_eq, declining radially as rho(r)~r^-n with n=3.0. The companion is luminous and inflated, with T_eff=10.0(+0.2,-0.1) kK, R_comp=13.1+/-0.2 R_sun, and log(L/L_sun)=3.19, contributing significantly to the flux (L_comp/L_Be~0.3). Spectral line mismatches further suggest a hydrogen-poor, CNO-processed atmosphere, consistent with a stripped-envelope star. HD 698 thus adds to the emerging class of Be+bloated OB binaries, capturing a brief post-mass-transfer phase when the donor remains spectroscopically detectable prior to the subdwarf stage.</description>

      <title>Recalibration of the Landolt UBVRI Standard Stars and the Generation of 5.4 Million New UBVRI Standard Stars using LAMOST and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and recalibration of the Landolt 2013 (celestial equator and $\delta \sim -50^\circ$) and 2016 ($\delta \sim -50^\circ$) standard stars in the Johnson $UBV$ and Kron-Cousins $RI$ systems, using tens of thousands of XPSP data from the BEst STar (BEST) database. Our analysis reveals an overall zero-point offset between the 2016 and 2013 datasets. We further identify zero-point offsets for each standard field, ranging from 5 -- 14 mmag across all $UBVRI$ bands, with correlations between offsets in different bands. Additionally, we confirm the spatial structures up to 7 -- 10 mmag in the $BVRI$ bands. We also find that spatial structures are similar across bands for the same field, and similar across different fields for the same band. These similarities may arise from the averaged flat-fields from each observing run. The recalibrated results are consistent with the XPSP data within 48 mmag in the $U$ band, 11 mmag in the $B$ band, and 5 -- 6 mmag in the $VRI$ bands in the brightness $G&lt;16$. Furthermore, based on stellar atmospheric parameters from LAMOST DR12 and Gaia DR3 photometry, along with the XPSP data, we derive temperature- and extinction-dependent extinction coefficients for the $UBVRI$ bands as well as a LAMOST \&amp; Gaia-based catalog of 5.4 million standard stars in the $UBVRI$ bands, for which the U-band photometry of the vast majority of sources exhibits significantly higher precision than XPSP. The recalibrated Landolt standard stars and LAMOST \&amp; Gaia-based standard stars will be available on the BEST website (https://nadc.china-vo.org/data/best/) and (https://doi.org/10.12149/101704).</description>

      <title>The Arizona-Montr\'eal spectroscopic survey of hot subluminous stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) and O (sdO) type stars are evolved helium-burning objects that lost their hydrogen envelope before the helium flash when their progenitors were close to the tip of the red giant branch. They populate the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Using the high-quality, homogeneous spectra of 336 hot subluminous star candidates from the Arizona-Montr\'eal Spectroscopic Survey, we aim to improve our understanding of the atmospheric and stellar properties of hot subdwarf stars. We used large grids of model atmospheres to fit the observed spectra and derived their atmospheric parameters: effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity, and helium abundance. The model grids were further utilized to fit the spectral energy distribution of each star and the $Gaia$ parallax was used to compute the stellar parameters radius, luminosity, and mass. We detected helium stratification in six sdB stars with Teff around 30 kK, making them good candidates for also showing $^3$He enrichment in their atmospheres. The mass distributions of H-rich sdBs and sdOs are similar and centered around 0.47 $\text{M}_\odot$, consistent with the canonical formation scenario of helium ignition under degenerate conditions. Among the H-rich hot subdwarfs, we found no difference between the mass distributions of close binaries and apparently single stars. The He-sdOs have a significantly wider mass distribution than their H-rich counterparts, with an average mass of about 0.78 $\text{M}_\odot$. This strongly favors a merger origin for these He-rich objects. We identified a small number of candidate low-mass ($&lt;$0.45$ \text{M}_\odot$) sdBs located below the EHB that might have originated from more massive progenitors. Finally, we identified more than 80 pulsating stars in our sample and found these to fall into well-defined $p$- and $g$-mode instability regions.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Physical and Geometrical Characteristics of the Close Visual Binary System HIP 45571</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we estimated the physical and geometrical characteristics of the visually close binary stellar system Hip 45571, using Al-Wardat's method for analyzing binary and multiple stellar systems. We estimated the physical properties of the components of the system for the four measured parallax given by Gaia and Hipparcos, which gives a dynamical mass sum ranges between 2.43 and 2.52 solar mass using the new orbital parameters following Tokovinin's dynamical method. The method used is a spectrophotometrical computational technique that employs Kurucz plane-parallel line-blanketed model atmospheres for single stars. These model atmospheres are used to construct the synthetic spectral energy distributions (SED) of each component and for the entire system. To ensure the method's accuracy, we apply the fit between synthetic and observational photometry under different filters, including the recently published Gaia DR3 measurements. The positions of the components on the H-R diagram and the evolutionary tracks were used to estimate their masses and ages. We found that the system consists of 2.24 Gyr two F2.5 IV and F3.5 IV subgiant components with T_eff_A= 6800, T_eff_B= 6700, logg=4.19 m/s^2, logg=4.33 m/s^2, R_A=1.77 R_sun, R_B=1.34 R_sun, L_A=6.01 L_sun, L_B=3.25 L_sun and Z=0.011.
  Depending on the masses estimated by Al-Wardat's method, a new parallax value of 28.72+-0.30 mas was obtained. Which lies between the values given by DR2 and DR3. This research underscores the importance of precision and reliability in employing these methods and measurements in a dynamic context, deepening our understanding of such stellar systems.</description>

      <title>The nature of ASASSN-24fw's occultation: modelling the event as dimming by optically thick rings around a sub-stellar companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.</description>

      <title>Mass ratio estimates for overcontact binaries using the derivatives of light curves. II. Systems with deep eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper that proposes a simple method for estimating mass ratios using the derivatives of light curves for overcontact binaries. In the first paper (Kouzuma 2023, ApJ, 958, 84) , we presented a method to estimate the mass ratios for systems exhibiting a double-peak feature in the second derivatives of their light curves around eclipses. This second paper focuses on overcontact systems that are not addressed in the first paper, that is, systems lacking a double peak in the second derivative. A sample of synthetic light curves for overcontact binaries consists of 89670, covering a parameter space typical of overcontact systems. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light-curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. We found that time intervals between two local extrema in the derivatives are associated with the mass ratio in systems that exhibit a high degree of eclipse obscuration. Using regression analysis for the identified associations, we derived empirical formulae to estimate the mass ratio and its associated uncertainty. The application of our proposed method to real overcontact binary data demonstrated its effectiveness in providing reliable estimates for both values.</description>

      <title>Resonances and Stellar Cycles: Observations and Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we discuss the possibility of the influence of parametric excitation, in particular, planetary gravitational interaction, on the behavior of stellar magnetic activity cycles. Using the well-known Parker dynamo modeling, we demonstrate the doubtfulness of the fact that planetary rotation can be a determining factor in the formation of the cycle itself. However, we show that even a weak parametric influence can be sufficient to modulation of magnetic field oscillations, and, in particular, to the occurrence of beats. This result is discussed in the context of the influence of Jupiter on the occurrence of maxima and minima of the magnetic activity of our Sun.</description>

      <title>Radio and Optical Flares on the dMe Flare Star EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a coordinated campaign to observe radio and optical stellar flares from the nearby M dwarf flare star EV~Lac. From a total of 27 hours of radio and 29 hours of optical observations, we examine the correspondence of the action of accelerated electrons of different energies in two distinct regions of the stellar atmosphere. We find that out of 9 optical flares with suitable radio coverage, only four have plausible evidence for a radio response. Optical photometric properties cannot predict which flares will have a radio response. From flares with time-resolved optical spectroscopy available, optical-only flares have similar implied electron distributions, while those with radio responses better correlate with higher low-energy cutoffs. The optical flares with a radio response all exhibit a delay between the optical and radio peaks of $\approx$1-7 minutes, with the optical flare peaking earlier in all cases. This likely indicates multiple loops are involved in the event, and/or the different impacts on electrons trapped in a magnetic loop (producing radio emission), versus those directly precipitating from the loop (producing the optical flare). We also remark on the radio spectral index behavior at early times for the largest radio flare observed in this study, which we interpret as evidence for increased opacity from a chromospheric evaporation front.</description>

      <title>Visualization of High Dynamic Range Solar Imagery and the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard visualizations of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) solar imagery often fail to convey the full complexity of the Sun's corona, especially in faint off-limb regions. This can leave the misleading impression of the Sun as a bright ball in a dark void, rather than revealing it as the dynamic, structured source of the solar wind and space weather. A variety of enhancement algorithms have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own strengths and tradeoffs. We introduce the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF), a novel hybrid technique that optimizes contrast in high dynamic range solar images. By combining the spatial awareness of radial graded filters with the perceptual benefits of histogram equalization, RHEF reveals faint coronal structures and works out of the box -- without requiring careful parameter tuning or prior dataset characterization. RHEF operates independently on each frame, and it enhances on-disk and off-limb features uniformly across the field of view. For additional control, we also present the Upsilon redistribution function -- a symmetrized cousin of gamma correction -- as an optional post-processing step that provides intuitive programmatic tonal compression. We benchmark RHEF against established methods and offer guidance on filter selection across various applications, with examples from multiple solar instruments provided in an appendix. Implemented and available in both Python sunkit_image and IDL, RHEF enables immediate improvements in solar coronal visualization.</description>

      <title>Cesam2k20: A code for a new generation of stellar evolution models. I. Description of the code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Cesam2k20, the latest version of the hydrostatic stellar evolution code CESAM originally developed by P. Morel and collaborators. Over the last three decades, it has undergone many improvements and has been extensively tested against other stellar evolution codes before being selected to compute the first-generation grid of stellar models for the PLATO mission. Among all the developments made thus far, Cesam2k20 now implements state-of-the-art models for the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum. It was recently made publicly available with an ecosystem of other codes interfaced with it: 1D and 2D oscillation codes ADIPLS and ACOR, optimisation program OSM, and Python utility package pycesam. This paper recalls the numerical peculiarities of Cesam2k20, namely, the use of a collocation method where the structure variables are decomposed as piecewise polynomials projected on a B-spline basis. Here, we review the options available for modelling the different physical processes. In particular, we illustrate the improvements made in the transport of chemical elements and angular momentum with a series of standard and non-standard solar models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of a star's radial velocity (RV) made using extremely stable, high resolution, optical or near infrared spectrographs can be used to determine the masses and orbital parameters of gravitationally-bound extra-solar planets (exoplanets). Indeed, RV surveys and follow up efforts have provided the vast majority of published exoplanet mass measurements and in doing so have enabled studies into exoplanet interior and atmospheric compositions. Here we review the current state of the RV field, with particular attention paid to:
  -The evolution of precise RV methodologies over the past two decades
  -Modern RV spectrograph designs that can be calibrated to a stability level of better than 50 cm/s over timescales of years
  -RV data reduction and post-processing techniques that minimize the impact of instrument systematics and stellar variability
  -Techniques for detecting exoplanets in RV data and disentangling planetary signals from stellar variability</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of optical companions to the population of millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster M3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) is a key ingredient to study binary and stellar evolution under extreme conditions. In this context, an accurate analysis of the optical emission, which is mostly dominated by the companion star, is essential for a comprehensive characterization of these systems and their role within their environment. In this work, we present a multi-wavelength investigation of five binary MSPs in the Galactic GC M3 (NGC 5272) using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our analysis builds on the timing solutions obtained with the FAST radio Telescope by Li et al. (2024). For each MSP, we carry out precise astrometric cross-matching with the accurate radio positions to identify potential counterparts. When a match is found, we analyse its location in the colour-magnitude diagrams and compare the results with updated binary evolution models to infer the system properties. We confirm the identification of the optical companion to M3B, matching the source previously reported by Cadelano et al. (2019), and successfully identify and characterize the optical companions to M3D and M3F. All three are consistent with helium white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical formation scenario. For M3A and M3E, no reliable counterparts are found, but we place strong upper limits on the brightness and mass of the undetected companion. In the case of M3E, we detect a red object near the radio position in two F814W observations; however, astrometric measurements over a 15-year baseline reveal a significant proper motion inconsistent with cluster membership, identifying the source as a foreground contaminant. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining precise radio timing with deep, multi-band HST images to uncover and constrain the nature of MSP companions in GCs, offering insights into their formation and evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Inferring the physics of protoplanetary disc evolution from the irradiated Cygnus OB2 region -- A comparison of viscous and MHD wind-driven scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding has crystallised around two possible evolution scenarios for protoplanetary discs (turbulent viscosity and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven) - but which dominates remains uncertain. Our aims are twofold: Firstly, we investigate whether a single set of model parameters can reproduce the observational constraints of non-irradiated and irradiated discs. Secondly, we propose a novel approach to break degeneracies between the two evolution scenarios by studying the relation of stellar accretion rate and externally driven wind mass-loss rates, which evolve differently depending on the mechanism of angular momentum transport in the outer disc. We evolve synthetic populations of protoplanetary discs using 1D vertically integrated models for both viscous and MHD wind-driven disc evolution including both internal X-ray and external far ultraviolet (FUV) photoevaporation for both evolution scenarios. We investigate both weak and strong FUV field environments, where the strong FUV field is calculated based on an environment similar to the Cygnus OB2 association. While both scenarios are able to reproduce observational constraints, our simulations suggest that different parameters are needed for the angular momentum transport to explain disc lifetimes and disc mass - stellar accretion rate relation in weakly and strongly irradiated regions. We find that the predicted median disc radii are much larger in low FUV environments compared to Cygnus OB2, but also decreasing with time. In the viscous scenario, the median disc radius in a low FUV field environment is ~100au larger than for the MHD wind-driven scenario. We further show that studying stellar accretion rates and externally driven wind mass-loss rates (provided that they can be isolated from internally driven winds; i.e. MHD wind) is indeed a promising way of disentangling the two evolution scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion processes in the planetary-mass regime remain poorly constrained, yet they strongly influence planet formation, evolution, and the composition of circumplanetary disks (CPDs). We investigate the resolved Balmer hydrogen emission-line profiles and their variability in the ~13Mjup, 30-45 Myr-old companion Delorme to constrain the underlying accretion mechanisms. Using VLT/UVES, we obtained 31 new epochs of high-resolution optical spectra (330-680 nm, R = 50,000), probing variability from hours to years. We analyze the shape and flux variability of hydrogen emission lines and compare them to two proposed origins: magnetospheric accretion funnels and localized accretion shocks. We detect Balmer lines from Halpha to H10 (6564-3799 AA) and a UV continuum excess, both indicative of ongoing accretion. All features are variable. The hydrogen lines decompose into two static components that vary only in flux. The broader velocity component correlates strongly with the UV excess and is qualitatively consistent with magnetospheric funnel models, but not with shock models. This component dominates the shape variability. The narrower component, which correlates less with the UV excess, is better matched by shock-emission models and drives most of the flux variability. Line fluxes show low variability on hour timescales but up to ~100% over weeks, similar to T Tauri stars. Our findings support magnetospheric accretion as the origin of the broad component. The narrow component may arise from accretion shocks or chromospheric activity. Higher-cadence observations could reveal rotational modulations and help constrain the object's rotation period and accretion geometry.</description>

      <title>The First Occurrence Rate Estimates for Exoplanets in Small-Separation Binary Star Systems: Planet Occurrence is Suppressed in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet occurrence rates facilitate comparisons between observations of planets and theoretical models of planet formation. Despite their deductive power, exoplanet occurrence rates for half the stars in the sky are missing because occurrence rate studies systematically exclude binary star systems. We assembled a large sample of high-likelihood binaries from the Kepler mission to calculate occurrence rates for circumstellar (S-type) planets in small-separation binary star systems ($\lesssim 100$ au) for the first time. For a sample of high-likelihood small-separation binaries, we found binaries to host 58% fewer planets per system than single stars to 11.4$\sigma$ significance within 1-4 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-50 d, and 50% fewer planets compared to single stars when integrating over the full parameter space of 1-10 $R_{\oplus}$ and 1-100 d to 3.8$\sigma$ significance.. We found no evidence for a radius valley or radius cliff, instead detecting a smooth decline in planet occurrence with increasing planetary radius. The difference between the single-star planet radius distribution and the binary-star planet radius distribution is 4.3$\sigma$ significant from a Kolomogorov-Smirnov test. These results suggest significantly different planet formation and survival outcomes in binaries compared to single stars, and support other studies that have measured a deficit of observed planets in binary star systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking differential reddening in front of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar extinction is a major obstacle in determining accurate stellar parameters from photometry near the Galactic disk. It is especially true for globular clusters at low galactic latitudes, which suffer from significant amounts of, and spatially variable reddening. Although differential reddening maps are available for tens of clusters, establishing and validating the absolute zero point of relative maps is a challenge. In this study, we present a new approach to determine and evaluate absolute reddening zero-points for Galactic globular clusters by combining three-dimensional reddening maps with Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae data. As a first case study, we investigate the low-latitude globular cluster M9. We compare the Gaia photometry and color data of the cluster member RR Lyrae stars to field RR Lyrae stars with accurate parallaxes and whose photometric metallicities match that of M9, as well as to theoretical models. We calculate the dereddened Gaia colors for the M9 stars based on three zero points. We confirm that the original SFD map appears to be overcorrecting the reddening for at least some RR Lyrae stars, albeit not excessively. In contrast, the 3D Bayestar map and the recalibrated version of the SFD map provide physically plausible reddenings, which we accept as lower and upper limits for M9, respectively. Our results provide a physically motivated reddening range for M9, and outline a methodology that can be directly extended to other globular clusters that are accessible to the Gaia mission, and to other multicolor sky surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Revisited for existence proof of optimal solution in Bernoulli free boundary problem using an energy-gap cost functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bernoulli free boundary problem is numerically solved via shape optimization that minimizes a cost functional subject to state problems constraints. In \cite{1}, an energy-gap cost functional was formulated based on two auxiliary state problems, with existence of optimal solution attempted through continuity of state problems with respect to the domain. Nevertheless, there exists a corrigendum in Eq.(48) in \cite{1}, where the boundedness of solution sequences for state problems with respect to the domain cannot be directly estimated via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as \textbf{Claimed}. In this comment, we rectify this proof by Poincar\'e-Friedrichs inequality.</description>

Abstract: Disc winds driven by thermal and magnetic processes are thought to play a critical role in protoplanetary disc evolution. However, the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain, particularly in light of their observational signatures. We investigate whether spatially resolved emission and synthetic spectral line profiles can distinguish between thermally and magnetically driven winds in protoplanetary discs. We modelled three disc wind scenarios with different levels of magnetisation: a relatively strongly magnetised wind ($\beta$4), a rather weakly magnetised wind ($\beta$6), and a purely photoevaporative wind (PE). Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generated synthetic emission maps and line profiles for [OI] 6300 \r{A}, [NeII] 12.81 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and o-H2 2.12 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, and compared them with observations. The $\beta$4 model generally produces broader and more blueshifted low-velocity components across all tracers, consistent with compact emission regions and steep velocity gradients. The $\beta$6 and PE models yield narrower profiles with smaller blueshifts, in better agreement with most observed narrow low-velocity components (NLVCs). We also find that some line profile diagnostics, such as the inclination at maximum centroid velocity, are not robust discriminants. However, the overall blueshift and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the low-velocity components provide reliable constraints. The $\beta$4 model reproduces the most extreme blueshifted NLVCs in observations, while most observed winds are more consistent with the $\beta$6 and PE models. Our findings reinforce previous conclusions that most observed NLVCs are compatible with weakly magnetised or purely photoevaporative flows. The combination of line kinematics and emission morphology offers meaningful constraints on wind-driving physics.</description>

Abstract: Massive stars play a decisive role in the evolution of the Universe. In order to constrain their current state and structure, we need sufficiently complex models, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic observations. However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2 mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters: m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk, and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass, like del, zet or sig Ori.</description>

      <title>The Unhurried Universe: A Continued Search for Long Term Variability in ASAS-SN</title>

Abstract: We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5&lt;g&lt;15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than ~0.03 mag/year over 10 years. We find 426 slowly-varying systems. Of these systems, 200 are identified as variables for the first time, 226 are previously classified as variables, and we find equal numbers of sources becoming brighter and fainter. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. Much like Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, the sources are scattered across the color magnitude diagram and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. There are also six AGN. There are 262 candidates (~62 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 66 of these candidates may be related to dust. Combining the new slow variable candidates with the candidates from Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, we have found a total of 1208 slow variables.</description>

      <title>1000-10,000 M$_\odot$ Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in GS 3073 at $z = 5.55$</title>

Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual N/O ratios that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the nitrogen excess in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Triples vs. Globular Clusters: Binary black hole merger eccentricity distributions compete and evolve with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23212</link>

Abstract: The formation mechanisms of merging binary black holes (BBHs) observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration remain uncertain. Detectable eccentricity provides a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing between different formation channels, but resolving their eccentricity distributions requires the detection of a large number of eccentric mergers. Future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will detect tens of thousands of BBH mergers out to redshifts $z \ge 10$, making it critical to understand the redshift-dependent evolution of eccentricity distributions. We simulate this evolution for two key channels: dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), which leads to rapid, eccentric mergers; and hierarchical triples in the field, where three-body dynamics can induce eccentricity in the inner binary. When considering all BBH mergers, the GC channel dominates overall, consistent with previous studies. However, when focusing on mergers with detectable eccentricity in next-generation detectors, we find that hierarchical triples dominate the eccentric merger rate at $0\le z \le 4$, with GC mergers becoming competitive at higher redshifts. Across all model variations, eccentric mergers in the local Universe ($z\lesssim 1$) have significant contributions from field triples, challenging the common view that such systems primarily form in dense environments. We show that, regardless of cluster and stellar evolution uncertainties, hierarchical triples contribute at least 30 per cent of eccentric mergers across a large range of redshifts.</description>
