      <title>Shoulder of Dust Rings Formed by Planet-disk Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of mm-wavelength protoplanetary disk observations have revealed several emission excesses on the previously identified dust rings, referred to as dust shoulders. The prevalence of dust shoulders suggests that they trace a common but unclear mechanism. In this work, we combine 3D, multifluid hydrodynamic simulations with radiative transfer calculations to explain the formation of dust shoulders. We find that the ring-shoulder pairs can result from the 3D planet-disk interactions with massive, gap-opening planets. The key driver is the dust filtration effect at the local pressure maximum due to planet-driven outward gas flows. Our work provides a possible explanation for the outer dust shoulders in recent super-resolution analyses of ALMA observations. It also provides insights into the formation of the inner dust shoulder in the PDS 70 disk and highlights the role of 3D effects in planet-disk interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Direct low-energy trajectories to Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and meteoroids in heliocentric orbits with perihelion below 1.3 au. Similarly to the population of the Main Asteroid Belt, NEOs are primordial bodies and their study can improve our understanding of the origins of the Solar System. With a catalog of over 30~000 known asteroids and approximately 100 listed short-period comets, the NEO population represents an inventory of exploration targets reachable with significantly lower cost than the objects of the Main Asteroid Belt. In addition, the materials present in these bodies could be used to resupply spacecraft en route to other destinations. The trajectories of past missions to NEOs have been designed with the patched-conics technique supplemented by impulsive and/or low-thrust maneuvers and planetary gravity assist. The transfer times range from some months to a few years, and the close-approach speeds relative to the target have been as high as 10 km/s. The design technique described in this work leverages the invariant structures of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) to connect the vicinity of the Earth with NEOs in low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits. The fundamental building blocks are periodic orbits around the collinear points L$_1$ and L$_2$ of the Sun-Earth CR3BP. These orbits are used to generate paths that follow the associated hyperbolic invariant manifolds, exit the sphere of influence of the Earth and reach NEOs on nearby orbits. The strategy is simple, can be applied to depart either a libration point orbit or the vicinity of the Earth, and offers attractive performance features.</description>

      <title>Clearing the Air: Updated CS Fluorescence Efficiencies Don't Solve the NUV/Sub-mm Cometary CS Abundance Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of carbon monosulfide (CS), a possible photodissociation fragment of CS$_2$, has a long history serving as a remote proxy for atomic sulfur, and more broadly, one of the sulfur reservoirs in cometary bodies. Interpretations of CS fluorescence emissions in ultraviolet observations of comets have, to-date, relied on a murky and ill-documented lineage of calculations for CS fluorescence efficiencies that can be difficult to assess. We report new fluorescence efficiencies of the CS radical, utilizing a rovibrational structure with vibrational states up to $v = 8$ and rotational states up to $N = 100$. A new set of band transition rates is produced through benchmarking comparisons to laboratory electron impact experiments, and subsequently utilized in the fluorescence calculations. We confirm historical reports of the ultraviolet $(0,0)$ band fluorescence efficiency, and conclude that blends and an expanded rovibrational structure have little impact on the fluorescence properties. Combined, the present results affirm the accuracy of the historical record of sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS emissions in cometary observations with e.g., IUE and HST. Benchmark comparisons to IUE observations of comet Bradfield show favorable agreement with the theoretical models. We expand the model to the time-domain, and find that thermalization of the ground state and/or `hot' initial distributions of CS lead to noticable changes in the shape of the $(0,0)$ band. The impact on existing sulfur abundances derived via ultraviolet CS observations, and new connections to sulfur reservoirs in protoplanetary disks are discussed. The model code and computed fluorescence efficiencies are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Source regions of carbonaceous meteorites and NEOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims to determine the source regions of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CI, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB, or C-ungrouped). We studied 38 individual asteroid families, including young and old ones, and determined their contributions to the NEO populations at metre and kilometre sizes using collisional and orbital models. Our models are in agreement with spectroscopic observations of NEOs, cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, statistics of bolides, infrared emission from dust bands, composition of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), or abundance of extraterrestrial helium-3. We identified the Veritas, Polana and Eos families as the primary sources of CM/CR, CI and CO/CV/CK chondrites, respectively. Substantial contributions are also expected from CM-like K\"onig and CI-like Clarissa, Misa and Hoffmeister families. The source regions of kilometre-sized bodies are generally different. The Adeona family is by far the main source of CM-like NEOs, whereas the Polana (low-i) and Euphrosyne (high-i) families are at the origin of most CI-like NEOs. The Polana family is the likely source of both Ryugu and Bennu. We were able to link spectroscopically and dynamically several NEOs to the Baptistina family. Finally, it appears that the pre-atmospheric flux of carbonaceous chondrites at metre sizes is about the same as that of ordinary chondrites. Given the difference in fall statistics between the two groups (80\% versus 4.4\%), this implies either substantial atmospheric fragmentation of carbonaceous bodies at the level of ${\sim}0.5\,{\rm MPa}$, or destruction by thermal cracking and water desorption. The source regions of most meteorites and kilometre-sized NEOs have now been determined; including some minor classes like enstatite chondrites and achondrites (Nysa, Hungaria), acapulcoites/lodranites (Iannini).</description>

      <title>First JVLA Radio Observation on PDS70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDS~70 is a protoplanetary system that hosts two actively accreting gas giants, namely PDS~70b and PDS~70c. The system has a $\sim$60--100 au dusty ring that has been resolved by ALMA, along with circumplanetary disks around the two gas giants. Here we report the first JVLA Q (40--48 GHz), Ka (29--37 GHz), K (18--26 GHz), and X (8--12 GHz) bands continuum observations, and the complementary ALMA Bands 3 ($\sim$98 GHz) and 4 ($\sim$145 GHz) observations towards PDS~70. The dusty ring appears azimuthally asymmetric in our ALMA images. We obtained firm detections at Ka and K bands without spatially resolving the source; we obtained a marginal detection at Q band, and no detection at X band. The spectral indices ($\alpha$) are 5$\pm$1 at 33--44 GHz and 0.6$\pm$0.2 at 22--33 GHz. At 10--22 GHz, the conservative lower limit of $\alpha$ is 1.7. The 33--44 GHz flux density is likely dominated by the optically thin thermal emission of grown dust with $\gtrsim$1 mm maximum grain sizes, which may be associated with the azimuthally asymmetric substructure induced by planet-disk interaction. Since PDS~70 was not detected at X band, we found it hard to explain the low spectral index at 22--33 GHz only with free-free emission. Hence, we attribute the dominant emission at 22--33 GHz to the emission of spinning nanometer-sized dust particles, while free-free emission may partly contribute to emission at this frequency range. In some protoplanetary disks, the emission of spinning nanometer-sized dust particles may resemble the 20--50 GHz excess in the spectra of millimeter-sized dust. The finding of strong continuum emission of spinning nanometer-sized particles can complicate the procedure of constraining the properties of grown dust. Future high-resolution, multi-frequency JVLA/ngVLA and SKA observations may shed light on this issue.</description>

      <title>Evaluating potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a multi-criteria decision making approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E, is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>

      <title>Origin of Asteroid (101955) Bennu and its Connection to the New Polana Family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asteroid (142) Polana is classified as a B-type asteroid located in the inner Main Belt. This asteroid is the parent of the New Polana family, which has been proposed to be the likely source of primitive near-Earth asteroids such as the B-type asteroid (101955) Bennu. To investigate the compositional correlation between Polana and Bennu at the 3-micron band and their aqueous alteration histories, we analyzed the spectra of Polana in the ~2.0-4.0-micron spectral range using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. Our findings indicate that Polana does not exhibit discernable 3-micron hydrated mineral absorption (within 2 sigma), which is in contrast to asteroid Bennu. Bennu displayed a significant 3-micron absorption feature similar to CM- and CI-type carbonaceous chondrites. This suggests two possibilities: either Bennu did not originate from the New Polana family parented by asteroid Polana or the interior of Bennu's parent body was not homogenous, with diverse levels of aqueous alteration. Several explanations support the latter possibility, including heating due to shock waves and pressure, which could have caused the current dehydrated state of Bennu's parent body.</description>

      <title>Water Evolution &amp; Inventories of Super-Earths Orbiting Late M-Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Earths orbiting M-dwarf stars may be the most common habitable planets in the Universe. However, their habitability is threatened by intense irradiation from their host stars, which drives the escape of water to space and can lead to surface desiccation. We present simulation results of a box model of water cycling between interior and atmosphere and loss to space, for terrestrial planets of mass 1--8 $M_\oplus$ orbiting in the habitable zone of a late M-dwarf. Energy-limited loss decreases with planetary mass, while diffusion-limited loss increases with mass. Depending on where it orbits in the habitable zone, a 1 $M_\oplus$ planet that starts with 3--8 Earth Oceans can end up with an Earth-like surface of oceans and exposed continents; for an 8 $M_\oplus$ super-Earth, that range is 3--12 Earth Oceans. Planets initialized with more water end up as waterworlds with no exposed continents, while planets that start with less water have desiccated surfaces by 5 Gyr. Since the mantles of terrestrial planets can hold much more water than is currently present in Earth's atmosphere, none of our simulations result in Dune planets -- such planets may be less common than previously thought. Further, more water becomes sequestered within the mantle for larger planets. A super-Earth at the inner edge of the habitable zone tends to end up as either a waterworld or with a desiccated surface; only a narrow range of initial water inventory yields an Earth-like surface.</description>

      <title>BYORP and Dissipation in Binary Asteroids: Lessons from DART</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near-Earth binary asteroid Didymos was the target of a planetary defense demonstration mission DART in September 2022. The smaller binary component, Dimorphos, was impacted by the spacecraft in order to measure momentum transfer in kinetic impacts into rubble piles. DART and associated Earth-based observation campaigns have provided a wealth of scientific data on the Didymos-Dimorphos binary. DART revealed a largely oblate and ellipsoidal shape of Dimorphos before the impact, while the post-impact observations suggest that Dimorphos now has a prolate shape. Here we add those data points to the known properties of small binary asteroids and propose new paradigms of the radiative binary YORP (BYORP) effect as well as tidal dissipation in small binaries. We find that relatively spheroidal bodies like Dimorphos made of small debris may experience a weaker and more size-dependent BYORP effect than previously thought. This could explain the observed values of period drift in several well-characterized binaries. We also propose that energy dissipation in small binaries is dominated by relatively brief episodes of large-scale movement of (likely surface) materials, rather than long-term steady-state tidal dissipation. We propose that one such episode was triggered on Dimorphos by the DART impact. Depending on the longevity of this high-dissipation regime, it is possible that Dimorphos will be more dynamically relaxed in time for the Hera mission than it was in the weeks following the impact.</description>

      <title>The Solar System could have formed in a low-viscosity disc: A dynamical study from giant planet migration to the Nice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of low-viscosity protoplanetary discs (PPDs), the formation scenarios of the Solar System should be revisited. In particular, the Jupiter-Saturn pair has been shown to lock in the 2:1 mean motion resonance while migrating generally inwards, making the Grand Tack scenario impossible. We explore what resonant chains of multiple giant planets can form in a low-viscosity disc, and whether these configurations can evolve into forming the Solar System in the post gas disc phase. We used hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration of the giant planets in a disc with viscosity $\alpha=10^{-4}$. After a transition phase to a gas-less configuration, we studied the stability of the obtained resonant chains through their interactions with a disc of leftover planetesimals by performing N-body simulations using rebound. The gaps open by giant planets are wider and deeper for lower viscosity, reducing the damping effect of the disc and thus weakening resonant chains. Exploring numerous configurations, we found five stable resonant chains of four or five planets. In a thin PPD, the four giant planets revert their migration and migrate outwards. After disc dispersal, under the influence of a belt of planetesimals, some resonant chains undergo an instability phase while others migrate smoothly over a billion years. For three of our resonant chains, about 1% of the final configurations pass the four criteria to fit the Solar System. The most successful runs are obtained for systems formed in a cold PPD with a massive planetesimal disc. This work provides a fully consistent study of the dynamical history of the Solar System's giant planets, from the protoplanetary disc phase up to the giant planet instability. Although building resonant configurations is difficult in low-viscosity discs, we find it possible to reproduce the Solar System from a cold, low-viscosity protoplanetary disc.</description>

      <title>SPYGLASS. V. Spatially and Temporally Structured Star-Forming Environments in the Cepheus-Hercules Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young associations record complete histories of star forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older ($\tau &gt; 100$ Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25-40 Myr), Cinyras (28-43 Myr), and Cupavo (54-80 Myr). With $9552 \pm 960$ stars in Orpheus, $3872 \pm 455$ stars in Cinyras, and $8794 \pm 1827$ stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multi-origin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Weyl formulae for some singular metrics with application to acoustic modes in gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by recent works on inverse problems for acoustic wave propagation in the interior of gas giant planets. In such planets, the speed of sound is isotropic and tends to zero at the surface. Geometrically, this corresponds to a Riemannian manifold with boundary whose metric blows up near the boundary. Here, the spectral analysis of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator is presented and the Weyl law is derived. The involved exponents depend on the Hausdorff dimension which, in the supercritical case, is larger than the topological dimension.</description>

      <title>The Mean Longitudinal Magnetic Field and its Uses in Radial-Velocity Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the analysis of the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a stellar activity tracer in the context of small exoplanet detection and characterisation in radial-velocity (RV) surveys. We use SDO/HMI filtergrams to derive Sun-as-a-star magnetic field measurements, and show that the mean longitudinal magnetic field is an excellent rotational period detector and a useful tracer of the solar magnetic cycle. To put these results into context, we compare the mean longitudinal magnetic field to three common activity proxies derived from HARPS-N Sun-as-a-star data: the full-width at half-maximum, the bisector span and the S-index. The mean longitudinal magnetic field does not correlate with the RVs and therefore cannot be used as a one-to-one proxy. However, with high cadence and a long baseline, the mean longitudinal magnetic field outperforms all other considered proxies as a solar rotational period detector, and can be used to inform our understanding of the physical processes happening on the surface of the Sun. We also test the mean longitudinal magnetic field as a "stellar proxy" on a reduced solar dataset to simulate stellar-like observational sampling. With a Gaussian Process regression analysis, we confirm that the solar mean longitudinal magnetic field is the most effective of the considered indicators, and is the most efficient rotational period indicator over different levels of stellar activity. This work highlights the need for polarimetric time series observations of stars.</description>

Abstract: The presence and distribution of water on the Moon are fundamental to our understanding of the Earth-Moon system. Despite extensive research and remote detection, the origin and chemical form of lunar water (H2O) have remained elusive. In this study, we present the discovery of a hydrated mineral, (NH4)MgCl3*6H2O, in lunar soil samples returned by the Chang'e-5 mission, containing approximately 41 wt% H2O. The mineral's structure and composition closely resemble novograblenovite, a terrestrial fumarole mineral formed through the reaction of hot basalt with water-rich volcanic gases, and carnallite, an earth evaporite mineral. We rule out terrestrial contamination or rocket exhaust as the origin of this hydrate, based on its chemical and isotopic compositions and formation conditions. The presence of ammonium indicates a more complex lunar degassing history and highlights its potential as a resource for lunar habitation. Our findings also suggest that water molecules can persist in sunlit areas of the Moon as hydrated salt, providing crucial constraints to the fugacity of water and ammonia vapor in lunar volcanic gases.</description>

      <title>Dome Craters on Ganymede and Callisto May Form by Topographic Relaxation of Pit Craters Aided by Remnant Impact Heat</title>

Abstract: The icy Galilean satellites display impact crater morphologies that are rare in the Solar System. They deviate from the archetypal sequence of crater morphologies as a function of size found on rocky bodies and other icy satellites: they exhibit central pits in place of peaks, followed by central dome craters, anomalous dome craters, penepalimpsests, palimpsests, and multi-ring structures. Understanding the origin of these features will provide insight into the geophysical factors that operate within the icy Galilean satellites. Pit craters above a size threshold feature domes. This trend, and the similarity in morphology between the two classes, suggest a genetic link between pit and dome craters. We propose that dome craters evolve from pit craters through topographic relaxation, facilitated by remnant heat from the impact. Our finite element simulations show that, for the specific crater sizes where we see domes on Ganymede and Callisto, domes form from pit craters within 10 Myr. Topographic relaxation eliminates the stresses induced by crater topography and restores a flat surface: ice flows downwards from the rim and upwards from the crater depression driven by gravity. When the starting topography is a pit crater, the heat left over from the impact is concentrated below the pit. Since warm ice flows more rapidly, the upward flow is enhanced beneath the pit, leading to the emergence of a dome. Given the timescales and the dependence on heat flux, this model could be used to constrain the thermal history and evolution of these moons.</description>

      <title>9 new M Dwarf Planet Candidates from TESS Including 5 Gas Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection of 9 new planet candidates orbiting M dwarfs, identified using an independent search and vetting pipeline applied to TESS Full-Frame Image (FFI) data from Sectors 1 to 63. Our candidates include planets as small as 1.4 $R_{\oplus}$, with orbital periods up to 20 days. Among the 9 new candidates, we identified 5 gas giants, which represent a rare and unexpected outcome of planet formation. Our findings add to the growing sample of giant planets around M dwarfs found by TESS. We discuss their follow-up potential for mass measurements through radial velocity observations and atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. We highlight TIC 12999193.01 as a particularly unique gas giant candidate in an eccentric orbit and excellent potential for atmospheric characterisation.</description>
