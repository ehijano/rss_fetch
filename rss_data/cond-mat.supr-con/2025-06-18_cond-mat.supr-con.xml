      <title>Evolution of charge correlations in the hole-doped kagome superconductor CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge correlations in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ can be tuned by external perturbations such as doping or pressure. Here we present a study of charge correlations and superconductivity upon hole doping via Ti substitution on the V kagome sites in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ via synchrotron x-ray diffraction and scanning SQUID measurements. While the superconducting phase, as viewed via the vortex structure, remains conventional and unchanged across the phase diagram, the nature of charge correlations evolves as a function of hole-doping from the first superconducting dome into the second superconducting dome. For Ti doping in the first superconducting dome, competing $2\times 2 \times 2$ and $2\times 2 \times 4$ supercells form within the charge density wave state and are suppressed rapidly with carrier substitution. In the second superconducting dome, no charge correlations are detected. Comparing these results to those observed for CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ suggests important differences between hole doping via chemical substitution on the V and Sb sites, particularly in the disorder potential associated with each dopant.</description>

      <title>Electronic nematic normal and superconducting state in electron-doped copper-oxide superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The similarities and differences between hole- and electron-doped cuprates are central to studies of high-temperature superconductivity. While electronic nematicity is found to be pervasive in hole-doped cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and other unconventional superconductors, evidence for electronic nematicity in electron-doped cuprates remains elusive. Here, we discover that the normal state of electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 (SLCO) is nematic by the angle-resolved resistivity (ARR) method and the uncovered ground state at zero temperature is also nematic when superconductivity is suppressed by an applied magnetic field. As we deliberately change the substrate from tetragonal KTaO3(001) (KTO) to orthorhombic GdScO3(110) (GSO), the nematic director of SLCO is pinned by the epitaxial strain but the nematic amplitude remains roughly the same, implying that the nematicity originates from electron-electron correlations. The nematicity is significantly enhanced by the presence of superconducting fluctuations and its amplitude increases appreciably as the effective doping level of SLCO is lowered from optimal to underdoped. Thus, electronic nematicity is intrinsic to high-temperature superconductors regardless of differences in the structural and electronic configurations corresponding to hole or electron doping.</description>

      <title>Misfit layered superconductor (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)3 with possible layer-selective FFLO state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors are known for their novel emergent phenomena, however, lack of experimental probes beyond resistivity has hindered further exploration of diverse superconducting states. Bulk 2D superconductors, with superconducting layers separated by non-superconducting layers, offer a unique opportunity to break this limit. Here, we synthesized a single crystal of misfit layered compound (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)3, composed of alternately stacked tri-layer NbSe2 and non-superconducting block layers with incompatible unit cells. Due to its unique structure, 2D Ising superconductivity is maintained even in a bulk form. Resistivity and tunnel diode oscillator measurements reveal two distinct superconducting phases in magnetic field vs. temperature phase diagram. Combined with the theoretical analysis, the high-magnetic-field phase is identified as a layer-selective Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, where Ising and finite-q superconductivity are mixed due to the tri-layer structure. Bulk 2D superconductors with misfit structure offer a novel opportunity for understanding of 2D superconductivity through bulk measurements and interlayer engineering.</description>

      <title>Resolving Phonons in Superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} at Sub-Unit-Cell Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of phonons in cuprates remains controversial, with their complex lattice structure complicating the investigation. Here, we identify phonon modes originating from charge reservoir and superconducting layers of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} using sub-unit-cell resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We reveal several phonon modes exhibiting layer-specific localization: ~78 meV in-plane modes localized in the CuO2 planes, ~42 meV hybrid (in-plane and out-of-plane) modes in the CuO2 planes, and ~38 meV hybrid modes in the BiO layers. We also observe a periodic modulation of phonon frequencies induced by the superstructure, spatially correlating with the superconducting gap variation. Our findings offer new insights into the electron-phonon coupling in cuprates, fostering deeper exploration of the microscopic linkage between lattice dynamics and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Noncentrosymmetric High-Temperature Superconductivity in doped $d^9$ Multiferroics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroics with $d^9$ electronic configurations, such as $SnCuO_2$, $PbCuO_2$, and $BiNiO_2$, exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetic order and ferroelectricity. Motivated by the fundamental link between symmetry breaking, strong electron correlations, and unconventional superconductivity, we propose a materials design strategy targeting noncentrosymmetric high-temperature superconductors through chemical doping of engineered $d^9$ multiferroics. This approach bridges two phenomena: (i) the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in correlated insulators, and (ii) the emergence of superconductivity in doped Mott/charge-transfer systems.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of the low temperature planar carrier density in overdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether a quantum critical point (QCP) demarcates the end of the pseudogap (PG) regime in hole-doped cuprates at a singular doping level $p^* \approx 0.19$ remains an open question. A crucial part of this puzzle is how the carrier density predicted by electronic structure calculations is recovered for $p &gt; p^*$. Here, we use magnetic fields up to 67 T to suppress superconductivity down to 50 K, allowing simultaneous measurement of the low-temperature Hall number $n_{\mathrm{H}}$ and the in-plane resistivity anisotropy $\rho_a/\rho_b$ in overdoped Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals. We confirm a previous finding [Badoux et al., Nature 531, 210 (2016)] that $n_{\mathrm{H}}$(50 K) exhibits a sharp increase below $p^*$. Using the measured resistivity anisotropy, we extract the planar carrier density $n_{\mathrm{pl}} = n_{\mathrm{H}} (\rho_a/\rho_b)^{-1}$. The doping dependence of $n_{\mathrm{pl}}$(50 K) reveals two key findings: (i) at optimal doping, $n_{\mathrm{pl}} \approx p$, and (ii) the sharp rise in $n_{\mathrm{H}}(p)$ is softened such that the full Fermi volume ($n_{\mathrm{pl}} = 1 + p$) is only partially recovered at $p^*$. This result disfavors a conventional QCP scenario in which the PG endpoint corresponds to a reconstructed Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>

Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a topological structure: namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence of charge- and spin-density waves in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ revealed by $^{139}$La-NQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ with a transition temperature $T_c$ close to 80 K at high pressures has attracted significant attention, due particularly to a possible density wave (DW) transition occurring near the superconducting dome. Identifying the type of DW order is crucial for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. However, owing to the presence of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and other intergrowth phases in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ samples, extracting the intrinsic information from the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase is challenging. In this study, we employed $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to eliminate the influence of other structural phases in the sample and obtain microscopic insights into the DW transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$. Below the DW transition temperature $T_{\rm DW} \sim$ 153K, we observe a distinct splitting in the $\pm$ 5/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 7/2 transition of the NQR resonance peak at the La(2) site, while only a line broadening is seen in the $\pm$ 3/2 $\leftrightarrow$ $\pm$ 5/2 transition peak. Through further analysis of the spectra, we show that the line splitting is due to a unidirectional charge modulation. A magnetic line broadening is also observed below $T_{\rm DW}$, accompanied by a large enhancement of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, indicating the formation of magnetically ordered moments in the DW state. Our results suggest a simultaneous formation of charge- and spin-density wave order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ , thereby offering critical insights into the electronic correlations in Ni-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as \emph{unconventional magnets} because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where \emph{$d$-wave altermagnets} and \emph{$p$-wave magnets} are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U&lt;2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U&gt;2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS wavefunction component is admixed.</description>

      <title>Roton Superconductivity from Loop-Current Chern Metal on the Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the evidence for time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in nonmagnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5, a novel electronic order of persistent orbital loop-current (LC) has been proposed for the observed charge density wave (CDW) state. The LC order and its impact on the succeeding superconducting (SC) state are central to the new physics of the kagome materials. We show that the LC order fundamentally changes the pairing instability and the SC state, leading to an extraordinary topological superconductor, dubbed as a roton superconductor. In the single-orbital model on the kagome lattice, the LC-CDW state is a Chern metal near van Hove filling with a partially filled Chern band hosting 3 Chern Fermi pockets (CFPs). Cooper pairing of quasiparticles on the CFPs generates 3 SC components coupled by complex Josephson couplings induced by the TRS breaking LC. Due to the discrete quantum geometry associated with the 3-fold rotation and sublattice permutation, a small LC produces a large Josephson phase that drives the leading SC instability to the roton superconductor where the relative phases of the 3 SC components are locked at 120{\deg}, forming an emergent vortex-antivortex lattice with pair density modulations. Properties of the roton superconductor include topological chiral edge states carrying nonzero electric currents, fractional 1/3 vortex excitations and charge-6e Cooper pair triplets that are immune to the internal chiral phase fluctuations. We discuss these SC properties in connection to recent experimental evidence for TRS breaking chiral SC state in kagome superconductors, exhibiting pair density modulations, zero-field SC diode effect, and charge-6e flux quantization. These findings are also relevant for the interplay between the orbital-driven quantum anomalous Hall and SC states in other systems, e.g. the graphene and transition metal dichalcogenide based quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</description>
