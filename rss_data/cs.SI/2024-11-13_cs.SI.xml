      <title>Degree Matrix Comparison for Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph alignment considers the optimal node correspondence across networks. To advance unsupervised graph alignment algorithms on plain graphs, we propose Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC). Through extensive experiments and mathematical motivations, we demonstrate the potential of this method. Remarkably, DMC achieves up to 99% correct node alignment for 90%-overlap graphs and 100% accuracy for isomorphic graphs. Additionally, we propose a reduced version of DMC (Greedy DMC) that provides a solution to the graph alignment problem with lower time complexity. DMC could significantly impact graph alignment, offering a reliable solution for the task.</description>

      <title>When Randomness Beats Redundancy: Insights into the Diffusion of Complex Contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.</description>

      <title>Is Graph Convolution Always Beneficial For Every Feature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing structured data. While traditional GNNs typically treat each feature dimension equally during graph convolution, we raise an important question: Is the graph convolution operation equally beneficial for each feature? If not, the convolution operation on certain feature dimensions can possibly lead to harmful effects, even worse than the convolution-free models. In prior studies, to assess the impacts of graph convolution on features, people proposed metrics based on feature homophily to measure feature consistency with the graph topology. However, these metrics have shown unsatisfactory alignment with GNN performance and have not been effectively employed to guide feature selection in GNNs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel metric, Topological Feature Informativeness (TFI), to distinguish between GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features, where its effectiveness is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Based on TFI, we propose a simple yet effective Graph Feature Selection (GFS) method, which processes GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features separately, using GNNs and non-GNN models. Compared to original GNNs, GFS significantly improves the extraction of useful topological information from each feature with comparable computational costs. Extensive experiments show that after applying GFS to 8 baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures across 10 datasets, 83.75% of the GFS-augmented cases show significant performance boosts. Furthermore, our proposed TFI metric outperforms other feature selection methods. These results validate the effectiveness of both GFS and TFI. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFS's improvements are robust to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its potential as a universal method for enhancing various GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on Enhancing Prediction in Social Network Advertisement through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>Auditing Political Exposure Bias: Algorithmic Amplification on Twitter/X Approaching the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximately 50% of tweets in X's user timelines are personalized recommendations from accounts they do not follow. This raises a critical question: what political content are users exposed to beyond their established networks, and how might this influence democratic discourse online? Due to the black-box nature and constant evolution of social media algorithms, much remains unknown about this aspect of users' content exposure, particularly as it pertains to potential biases in algorithmic curation. Prior research has shown that certain political groups and media sources are amplified within users' in-network tweets. However, the extent to which this amplification affects out-of-network recommendations remains unclear. As the 2024 U.S. Election approaches, addressing this question is essential for understanding the influence of algorithms on online political content consumption and its potential impact on users' perspectives. In this paper, we conduct a three-week audit of X's algorithmic content recommendations using a set of 120 sock-puppet monitoring accounts that capture tweets in their personalized ``For You'' timelines. Our objective is to quantify out-of-network content exposure for right- and left-leaning user profiles and to assess any potential biases in political exposure. Our findings indicate that X's algorithm skews exposure toward a few high-popularity accounts across all users, with right-leaning users experiencing the highest level of exposure inequality. Both left- and right-leaning users encounter amplified exposure to accounts aligned with their own political views and reduced exposure to opposing viewpoints. Additionally, we observe a right-leaning bias in exposure for new accounts within their default timelines.</description>

      <title>Exploiting User Comments for Early Detection of Fake News Prior to Users' Commenting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both accuracy and timeliness are key factors in detecting fake news on social media. However, most existing methods encounter an accuracy-timeliness dilemma: Content-only methods guarantee timeliness but perform moderately because of limited available information, while social con-text-based ones generally perform better but inevitably lead to latency because of social context accumulation needs. To break such a dilemma, a feasible but not well-studied solution is to leverage social contexts (e.g., comments) from historical news for training a detection model and apply it to newly emerging news without social contexts. This requires the model to (1) sufficiently learn helpful knowledge from social contexts, and (2) be well compatible with situations that social contexts are available or not. To achieve this goal, we propose to absorb and parameterize useful knowledge from comments in historical news and then inject it into a content-only detection model. Specifically, we design the Comments ASsisted FakE News Detection method (CAS-FEND), which transfers useful knowledge from a comment-aware teacher model to a content-only student model and detects newly emerging news with the student model. Experiments show that the CAS-FEND student model outperforms all content-only methods and even comment-aware ones with 1/4 comments as inputs, demonstrating its superiority for early detection.</description>

      <title>Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards Islam using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection and greater explainability. In this work, we represent speeches as nodes and connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. This study introduces a novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam. Our model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while providing valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.</description>

      <title>Learn from Heterophily: Heterophilous Information-enhanced Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under circumstances of heterophily, where nodes with different labels tend to be connected based on semantic meanings, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often exhibit suboptimal performance. Current studies on graph heterophily mainly focus on aggregation calibration or neighbor extension and address the heterophily issue by utilizing node features or structural information to improve GNN representations. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that the valuable semantic information inherent in heterophily can be utilized effectively in graph learning by investigating the distribution of neighbors for each individual node within the graph. The theoretical analysis is carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the idea in enhancing graph learning. Based on this analysis, we propose HiGNN, an innovative approach that constructs an additional new graph structure, that integrates heterophilous information by leveraging node distribution to enhance connectivity between nodes that share similar semantic characteristics. We conduct empirical assessments on node classification tasks using both homophilous and heterophilous benchmark datasets and compare HiGNN to popular GNN baselines and SoTA methods, confirming the effectiveness in improving graph representations. In addition, by incorporating heterophilous information, we demonstrate a notable enhancement in existing GNN-based approaches, and the homophily degree across real-world datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>CogErgLLM: Exploring Large Language Model Systems Design Perspective Using Cognitive Ergonomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02885v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is crucial for improving safety, reliability, and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM designs often lack this integration, resulting in systems that may not fully align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. This oversight exacerbates biases in LLM outputs and leads to suboptimal user experiences due to inconsistent application of user-centered design principles. Researchers are increasingly leveraging NLP, particularly LLMs, to model and understand human behavior across social sciences, psychology, psychiatry, health, and neuroscience. Our position paper explores the need to integrate cognitive ergonomics into LLM design, providing a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for ethical development. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI interactions.</description>
