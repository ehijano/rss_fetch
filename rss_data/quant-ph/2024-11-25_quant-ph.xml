      <title>Quantum CORDIC -- Arcsin on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a quantum algorithm for computing the arcsine function to an arbitrary accuracy. We leverage a technique from embedded computing and field-programmable gate array (FPGA), called COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC). CORDIC is a family of iterative algorithms that, in a classical context, can approximate various trigonometric, hyperbolic, and elementary functions using only bit shifts and additions. Adapting CORDIC to the quantum context is non-trivial, as the algorithm traditionally uses several non-reversible operations. We detail a method for CORDIC which avoids such non-reversible operations. We propose multiple approaches to calculate the arcsine function reversibly with CORDIC. For n bits of precision, our method has space complexity of order n qubits, a layer count in the order of n times log n, and a CNOT count in the order of n squared. This primitive function is a required step for the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, is necessary for quantum digital-to-analog conversion, can simplify a quantum speed-up for Monte-Carlo methods, and has direct applications in the quantum estimation of Shapley values.</description>

      <title>Comment on Quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for enhanced object detection (Opt. Express 32, 40150-40164, 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper by K. Sengupta et al. (Opt. Express 32, 40150-40164, 2024) explores quantum illumination using polarization-entangled photon pairs for object detection in noisy environments. In this comment, we highlight fundamental flaws in the mathematical model used to describe photon loss. We argue that the treatment of photon loss and its effects on quantum entanglement is incorrect. We demonstrate that the conclusions of Sengupta et al., particularly the detection of low-reflectivity objects using quantum correlations, are unsubstantiated, as the assumed resilience of polarization entanglement to photon loss contradicts established principles of quantum information theory. We present a more rigorous framework for describing the effects of photon loss on both polarization-encoded and photon-number quantum states. Additionally, we critique the approach used in the OE article to model photon loss in free-space optical (FSO) transmission, noting that it is based on a fiber-optic model that was adopted with insufficient attribution from an earlier publication. We propose several improvements to enhance the modeling of FSO photon loss.</description>

      <title>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties.
  The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[64, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Runge-Lenz operator in the momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental quantum Coulomb problem in the momentum space is considered. A differential equation with SO(4) simmetry has been obtained in the momentum space instead of the integral Fock equation. The corresponding equation in the coordinate space is the sum of the squares of the angular momentum and the Runge-Lenz operators.This approach is unknown in the momentum space where the Runge-Lenz operator is not applied in the existing theory. The Runge-Lenz operator obtained in the momentum space is simplier than that in the coordinate space and allows one to effectively consider the Coulomb problem in the momentum space. A relation of new operator to the infinitesimal rotation operator of the three-dimensional the Fock sphere has been determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the well known Rayleigh-Ritz method (RRM) to the projection of a Hamiltonian operator chosen recently for the extension of the variational principle to ensemble states.

      <title>A relativistic QFT description for the interaction of a spin with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze how non-relativistic effective models for the magnetic coupling of a spin to the electromagnetic field (proportional to $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}\cdot \boldsymbol{B}$) emerge from a full quantum field theoretical description of charged fermionic fields with the quantum electromagnetic field. This allows us to keep track of relativistic corrections to the models commonly used in experimental spin physics. We discuss how this interaction compares to the usual simplified models used in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Experimental optimal discrimination of $N$ states of a qubit with fixed rates of inconclusive outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a general optimized measurement scheme for discriminating between nonorthogonal quantum states, the error rate is minimized under the constraint of a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes (FRIO). This so-called optimal FRIO measurement encompasses the standard and well known minimum-error and optimal unambiguous (or maximum-confidence) discrimination strategies as particular cases. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the optimal FRIO discrimination between $N=2,3,5,$ and $7$ equally likely symmetric states of a qubit encoded in photonic path modes. Our implementation consists of applying a probabilistic quantum map which increases the distinguishability between the inputs in a controlled way, followed by a minimum-error measurement on the successfully transformed outputs. The results obtained corroborate this two-step approach and, in our experimental scheme, it can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions. The optimized measurement demonstrated here will be useful for quantum communication scenarios where the error rate and the inconclusive rate must be kept below the levels provided by the respective standard strategies.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Spin-Spin Interaction Mediated by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and chirality are two fundamental properties known to give rise to various intriguing phenomena. However, the interplay between these properties has been rarely explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an off-diagonal non-Hermitian spin-spin interaction mediated by chiral phonons. This interaction arises from the spin-selectivity due to the locking between phonon momentum and angular momentum in chiral materials. The resulting non-Hermitian interaction mediated by the vacuum field of chiral phonons can reach the kHz range for electron spins and can be further enhanced by externally driven mechanical waves, potentially leading to observable effects in the quantum regime. Moreover, the long-range nature of phonon-mediated interactions enables the realization of the long-desired non-Hermitian interaction among multiple spins. The effect proposed in this work may have wide-ranging applications in cascaded quantum systems, non-Hermitian many-body physics, and non-Hermitian cooling.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Achieving Entanglement Purification Protocol for Pauli Dephasing Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication facilitates the secure transmission of information and the distribution of entanglement, but the rates at which these tasks can be achieved are fundamentally constrained by the capacities of quantum channels. Although quantum repeaters typically enhance these rates by mitigating losses and noise, a simple entanglement swapping protocol via a central node is not effective against the Pauli dephasing channel due to the additional degradation introduced by Bell-state measurements. This highlights the importance of purifying distributed Bell states before performing entanglement swapping. In this work, we introduce an entanglement purification protocol assisted by two-way classical communication that not only purifies the states but also achieves the channel capacities. Our protocol uses an iterative process involving CNOT gates and Hadamard basis measurements, progressively increasing the fidelity of Bell states with each iteration. This process ensures that the resulting Bell pairs are perfect in the limit of many recursive iterations, making them ideal for use in quantum repeaters and for correcting dephasing errors in quantum computers. The explicit circuit we propose is versatile and applicable to any number of Bell pairs, offering a practical solution for mitigating decoherence in quantum networks and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Postselection in lattice bosons undergoing continuous measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the postselection problem in a specific model: bosons hopping on a lattice subjected to continuous local measurements of quadrature observables. We solve the model analytically and show that the postselection overhead can be reduced by postprocessing the entire measurement record into one or two numbers for each trajectory and then postselecting based only on these numbers. We then provide a step-by-step protocol designed to recover connected two-point functions of the quantum trajectories, which display an exponentially decaying profile that is not observable in the unconditional, trajectory averaged, state. With the analytical solution in hand, we analyse the features of this postprocessing stage with the intention of abstracting away the properties that make postselection feasible in this model and may help in mitigating postselection in more general settings. We also test the protocol numerically in a way that utilizes only experimentally accessible information, showing that various quantum trajectory observables can be recovered with a few repetitions of the numerical experiment, even after including inevitable coarse-graining procedures expected under realistic experimental conditions. Furthermore, all the information required to design the postprocessing stage is independently present both in the unconditional dynamics and also in the measurement record, thus bypassing the need to solve for the conditional evolution of the model. We finalize by providing experimental implementations of these models in cavity-QED and circuit-QED.</description>

      <title>Limits of the Lindblad and non-Hermitian description of open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While it is well established that the dynamics of an open system is described well by the Lindblad master equation if the coupling to the bath is either in the weak or in the singular limit, it is not known whether this description can be extended to some other coupling strength. Here we use the exact solution of a microscopic system coupled to baths, to show that, for a pure decay system, Lindbladian dynamics \textit{only} holds in the weak and singular coupling limits. We also show that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent in the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this equivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics for any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points can only occur in the singular coupling limit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that exceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated system is comparable to the relaxation time scale.</description>

      <title>Achieving computational gains with quantum error correction primitives: Generation of long-range entanglement enhanced by error detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors--relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy--while only requiring modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily-prepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion universality of mesoscopic entanglement fluctuations in free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement fluctuations associated with Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of wavefunctions offer a unique perspective on various fundamental issues ranging from quantum thermalization to state preparation in quantum devices. Very recently, a subset of present authors have shown that in a class of free-fermion lattice models and interacting spin chains, entanglement dynamics enters into a new regime at long time, with entanglement probes displaying persistent temporal fluctuations, whose statistics falls into the seemingly disparate paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations in condensed matter physics. This motivate us to revisit here entanglement dynamics of a canonical bosonic model in many-body physics, i.e., a coupled harmonic oscillator chain. We find that when the system is driven out of equilibrium, the long-time entanglement dynamics exhibits strictly the same statistical behaviors as that of free-fermion models. Specifically, irrespective of entanglement probes and microscopic parameters, the statistical distribution of entanglement fluctuations is flanked by asymmetric tails: sub-Gaussian for upward fluctuations and sub-Gamma for downward; moreover, the variance exhibits a crossover from the scaling $\sim 1/L$ to $\sim L_A^3/L^2$, as the subsystem size $L_A$ increases ($L$ the total system size). This insensitivity to the particle statistics, dubbed boson-fermion universality, is contrary to the common wisdom that statistical phenomena of many-body nature depend strongly on particle statistics. Together with our previous work, the present work indicates rich fluctuation phenomena in entanglement dynamics awaiting in-depth explorations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Descent for Graph Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Hamiltonian Descent as a novel approach to solve the graph partition problem. By reformulating graph partition as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, we leverage QHD's quantum-inspired dynamics to identify optimal community structures. Our method implements a multi-level refinement strategy that alternates between QUBO formulation and QHD optimization to iteratively improve partition quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our QHD-based approach achieves superior modularity scores (up to 5.49\%) improvement with reduced computational overhead compared to traditional optimization methods. This work establishes QHD as an effective quantum-inspired framework for tackling graph partition challenges in large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage via Solving Multivariate Quadratics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14697</link>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new way to (non-interactively, verifiably) demonstrate Quantum Advantage by solving the average-case $\mathsf{NP}$ search problem of finding a solution to a system of (underdetermined) multivariate quadratic equations over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ drawn from a specified distribution. In particular, we design a distribution of degree-2 polynomials $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\}_{i\in [m]}$ for $m&lt;n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which we show that there is a quantum polynomial-time algorithm that simultaneously solves $\{p_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=y_i\}_{i\in [m]}$ for a random vector $(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$. On the other hand, while a solution exists with high probability, we conjecture that it is classically hard to find one based on classical cryptanalysis that we provide, including a comprehensive review of all known relevant classical algorithms for solving multivariate quadratics. Our approach proceeds by examining the Yamakawa-Zhandry (FOCS 2022) quantum advantage scheme and replacing the role of the random oracle with our multivariate quadratic equations. Our work therefore gives several new perspectives:
  First, our algorithm gives a counterexample to the conventional belief that generic classically hard multivariate quadratic systems are also quantumly hard.
  Second, based on cryptanalytic evidence, our work gives an explicit simple replacement for the random oracle from the work of Yamakawa and Zhandry. We show how to instantiate the random oracle with families of just degree two multivariate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Uncorrectable-error-injection based reliable and secure quantum communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks aim to communicate distant quantum devices, such as quantum computers. In this context, a critical requirement is the secure and reliable transmission of arbitrary quantum states. Quantum teleportation is widely used to transmit arbitrary quantum states. However, it requires entanglement swapping and purification to distribute entanglements over long distances, introducing significant overhead and complexity. These challenges limit its practicality for real-world quantum communication networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel scheme for directly transmitting quantum states encoded using error-correction codes. The proposed scheme leverages the robustness of quantum error correction codes to ensure secure and reliable quantum communication. By encoding quantum states with error-correction codes and strategically injecting uncorrectable errors, we enhance the security and reliability of the transmission process. Our approach reduces the overhead associated with entanglement distribution and provides a high tolerance for transmission errors. This study presents an advancement in practical and scalable quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Multiplexed Quantum Repeater Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) codes and their application in quantum communication have attracted increasing attention. In particular, one typical CV codes, cat-codes, has already been experimentally created using trapped atoms in cavities with relatively high fidelities. However, when these codes are used in a repeater protocol, the secret key rate (SKR) that can be extracted between two remote users is extremely low. Here we propose a quantum repeater protocol based on cat codes with a few quantum memories or graph states as additional resources. This allows us to considerably increase the secret key rate by several orders of magnitude. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing efficient quantum repeater systems, advancing the feasibility and performance of quantum communication over long distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-hermitian Kitaev chain model, for arbitrary complex parameters. In particular, we give a concise characterisation of the curves of eigenvalues in the complex plane in the infinite size limit. Using this solution, we characterise under which conditions the skin effect is absent, and for which eigenstates this is the case. We also fully determine the region in parameter space for which the model has a zero mode.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Source-Independent Quantum Random Number Generator with a Single Phase-Insensitive Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness quantum mechanical unpredictability to produce true randomness, which is crucial for cryptography and secure communications. Among various QRNGs, source-independent QRNGs (SI-QRNGs) relax the trust on the quantum source, allowing for flexible use of advanced detectors to achieve high randomness generation rates. Continuous-variable (CV) SI-QRNGs, in particular, hold promise for practical deployment due to their simplicity and randomness generation rates comparable to trusted-device QRNGs. In this work, we propose a novel CV-SI-QRNG scheme with a single phase-insensitive detector, and provide security proof based on semi-definite programming (SDP). We introduce a dimension reduction technique, which rigorously reduces an infinite-dimensional SDP problem to a finite-dimensional one, enabling efficient computation while maintaining valid randomness lower bound. We further validate our method through simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, paving the way for practical and simple SI-QRNG implementations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Multiple String Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider the Multiple String Matching Problem. In this problem, we consider a long string, denoted by $t$, of length $n$. This string is referred to as a text. We also consider a sequence of $m$ strings, denoted by $S$, which we refer to as a dictionary. The total length of all strings from the dictionary is represented by the variable L. The objective is to identify all instances of strings from the dictionary within the text. The standard classical solution to this problem is Aho-Corasick Algorithm that has $O(n+L)$ query and time complexity. At the same time, the classical lower bound for the problem is the same $\Omega(n+L)$. We propose a quantum algorithm with $O(n+\sqrt{mL\log n}+m\log n)$ query complexity and $O(n+\sqrt{mL\log n}\log b+m\log n)=O^*(n+\sqrt{mL})$ time complexity, where $b$ is the maximal length of strings from the dictionary. This improvement is particularly significant in the case of dictionaries comprising long words. Our algorithm's complexity is equal to the quantum lower bound $O(n + \sqrt{mL})$, up to a log factor. In some sense, our algorithm can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the Aho-Corasick algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Cryptographic Conferencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cryptographic conferencing (QCC) allows sharing secret keys among multiple distant users and plays a crucial role in quantum networks. Due to the fragility and low generation rate of genuine multipartite entangled states required in QCC, realizing and extending QCC with the entanglement-based protocol is challenging. Measurement-device-independent QCC (MDI-QCC), which removes all detector side-channels, is a feasible long-distance quantum communication scheme to practically generate multipartite correlation with multiphoton projection measurement. Here we experimentally realize the three-user MDI-QCC protocol with four-intensity decoy-state method, in which we employ the polarization encoding and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state projection measurement. Our work demonstrates the experimental feasibility of the MDI-QCC, which lays the foundation for the future realization of quantum networks with multipartite communication tasks.</description>

      <title>Are vacuum fluctuations relevant in absorption dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum fluctuations play a central role in spontaneous emission. Recently, it has been suggested that these fluctuations could also be fundamental in the absorption dynamics, breaking the superposition inherent to the linear quantum evolution. We analyze the consistency of that proposal with previous results in double spontaneous emission. Moreover, for the case of single absorption by two atoms, we present a test based on the time dependence of the subsequent spontaneous emission patterns, which can experimentally settle the question. This test is more viable than the original proposal, built on the Casimir effect. Our approach also allows for the comparison between the time scales of vacuum fluctuations as a disentangling mechanism and an emission trigger.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Multi-parameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound with Antiunitary Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of multiple parameters is a ubiquitous requirement in many quantum metrology applications. However, achieving the ultimate precision limit, i.e. the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, becomes challenging in these scenarios compared to single parameter estimation. To address this issue, optimizing the parameters encoding strategies with the aid of antiunitary symmetry is a novel and comprehensive approach. For demonstration, we propose two types of quantum statistical models exhibiting antiunitary symmetry in experiments. The results showcase the simultaneous achievement of ultimate precision for multiple parameters without any trade-off and the precision is improved at least twice compared to conventional encoding strategies. Our work emphasizes the significant potential of antiunitary symmetry in addressing multi-parameter estimation problems.</description>

      <title>Towards Variational Quantum Algorithms for generalized linear and nonlinear transport phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) to solve linear and nonlinear thermofluid dynamic transport equations. The hybrid classical-quantum framework is applied to problems governed by the heat, wave, and Burgers' equation in combination with different engineering boundary conditions. Topics covered include the consideration of non-constant material properties and upwind-biased first- and higher-order approximations, widely used in engineering Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), by the use of a mask function. The framework is able to convert band matrices arising from Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized on structured grids into quantum gates, thus contributing to the development of a modular library for quantum computing translations of CFD procedures. Verification examples demonstrate high predictive agreement with classical methods. Furthermore, the scalability analysis shows a $\textit{polylog}$ complexity in the number of qubits of the quantum circuits involved. Remaining challenges refer to the implicit construction of upwind schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are few exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics for which the completeness relation of the energy eigenstates can be explicitly verified. In this article, we give an elementary proof that the set of bound (discrete) states together with the scattering (continuum) states of the reflectionless potential form a complete set. We also review a direct and elegant derivation of the energy eigenstates with proper normalization by introducing an analog of the creation and annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator problem. We further show that, in the case of a single bound state, the corresponding wave function can be found from the knowledge of continuum eigenstates of the system. Finally, completeness is shown by using the even/odd parity eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, which provides another explicit demonstration of a fundamental property of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>High-dynamic-range atomic clocks with dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is a maximally multiparticle entangled state capable of reaching the fundamental precision limit in quantum sensing. While GHZ-state-based atomic clocks hold the potential to achieve Heisenberg-limited precision [Nature 634, 315 (2024); Nature 634, 321 (2024)], they suffer from a reduced dynamic range. Here we demonstrate how Bayesian quantum estimation can be utilized to extend the dynamic range of GHZ-state-based atomic clocks while maintaining precision close to the Heisenberg limit. In the framework of Bayesian quantum estimation, we design a sequence of correlated Ramsey interferometry for atomic clocks utilizing individual and cascaded GHZ states.In this sequence, the interrogation time is updated based on the credible intervals of the posterior distribution.By combining an interferometry sequence with short and long interrogation times, our scheme overcomes the trade-off between sensitivity and dynamic range in GHZ-state-based atomic clocks and offers an alternative approach for extending dynamic range while maintaining high sensitivity. Notably our approach enables dual Heisenberg-limited precision scaling with respect to both particle number and total interrogation time. In addition to atomic clocks, our study offers a promising avenue for developing high-dynamic-range entanglement-enhanced interferometry-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Gill and Massar type bound for estimation of $SU(2)$ channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the estimation for a parametric family of quantum state on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, the Gill and Massar bound is known as a lower bound of weighted traces of covariances of unbiased estimators. The Gill and Massar bound is derived by considering the convexity of the set of classical Fisher information matrices, and the bound is locally achievable by using randomized strategies when $\mathcal{H}=\mathbb{C}^{2}$. In this paper, we show that estimation for a parametric $SU(2)$ unitary channel model has a similar convex structure as qubit state model, and a Gill and Massar type lower bound of weighted traces of covariances of unbiased estimators can be derived for any weight matrix. We show that the Gill and Massar type lower bound is achievable by using randomized strategies when certain conditions are satisfied. To derive a convex structure of the set of classical Fisher information matrices, we introduce a Fisher information matrix $J^{(U)}$ for a $SU(2)$ unitary channel model, and we show a upper bound of inverse $J^{(U)}$ weighted trace of classical Fisher information matrix. The optimal randomized strategy we construct in this paper does not require ancilla systems in many cases.</description>

      <title>A Constant Measurement Quantum Algorithm for Graph Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum algorithm for determining graph connectedness using a constant number of measurements. The algorithm can be extended to find connected components with a linear number of measurements. It relies on non-unitary abelian gates taken from ZX calculus. Due to the fusion rule, the two-qubit gates correspond to a large single action on the qubits. The algorithm is general and can handle any undirected graph, including those with repeated edges and self-loops. The depth of the algorithm is variable, depending on the graph, and we derive upper and lower bounds. The algorithm exhibits a state decay that can be remedied with ancilla qubits. We provide a numerical simulation of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Light-Matter Hybridization and Entanglement from the First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybridization between light and matter is fundamental for achieving cavity-induced control over quantum materials, necessitating accurate ab initio methods for their analysis. Among these, the quantum electrodynamics Hartree-Fock framework stands out as an essential mean field approximation for electron-electron and electron-photon interactions, forming the basis for advanced post-Hartree-Fock methods like quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster and auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo. However, trivial quantum electrodynamics Hartere-Fock (QEDHF) methods assume a product state ans\"atze and thus cannot describe the light-matter Entanglement. Furthermore, our previous work on variational ans\"atze approaches lacked the capability to capture anharmonic or nonlinear fluctuations, limiting their applicability to strongly coupled systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose an extended QEDHF formalism by introducing a variational Squeeze transformation capable of describing anharmonic quantum fluctuations in photon fields. By optimizing the squeezing parameters, our framework provides a more nuanced and accurate characterization of photon field quantum fluctuations, significantly enhancing the predictive power of QEDHF in strong coupling regimes. Moreover, this formalism enhances the description of light-matter Entanglement, providing a first-principles framework for understanding light-matter hybridization and paving the way for deeper insights into cavity-modified quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Threetangle in the XY-model class with a non-integrable field background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square root of the threetangle is calculated for the transverse XY-model with an integrability-breaking in-plane field component. To be in a regime of quasi-solvability of the convex roof, here we concentrate here on a 4-site model Hamiltonian. In general, the field and hence a mixing of the odd/even sectors, has a detrimental effect on the threetangle, as expected. Only in a particular spot of models with no or weak inhomogeneity $\gamma$ does a finite value of the tangle prevail in a broad maximum region of the field strength $h\approx 0.3\pm 0.1$. There, the threetangle is basically independent of the non-zero angle $\alpha$. This system could be experimentally used as a quasi-pure source of threetangled states or as an entanglement triggered switch depending on the experimental error in the field orientation.</description>

      <title>Color code with a logical control-$S$ gate using transversal $T$ rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The color code has been invaluable for the development of the theory of fault-tolerant logic gates using transversal rotations. Three-dimensional examples of the color code have shown us how its structure, specifically the intersection of the supports of logical operators, can give rise to non-Clifford $T$ and $CCZ$ gates. Here we present a color code with a logical control-$S$ gate that is accomplished with transversal $T$ and $T^\dagger$ rotations on its physical qubits.</description>

      <title>Energy participation ratio analysis for very anharmonic superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits are being employed for large-scale quantum devices, and a pertinent challenge is to perform accurate numerical simulations of device parameters. One of the most advanced methods for analyzing superconducting circuit designs is the energy participation ratio (EPR) method, which constructs quantum Hamiltonians based on the energy distribution extracted from classical electromagnetic simulations. In the EPR approach, we extract linear terms from finite element simulations and add nonlinear terms using the energy participation ratio extracted from the classical simulations. However, the EPR method relies on a low-order expansion of nonlinear terms, which is prohibitive for accurately describing highly anharmonic circuits. An example of such a circuit is the fluxonium qubit, which has recently attracted increasing attention due to its high lifetimes and low error rates. In this work, we extend the EPR approach to effectively address highly nonlinear superconducting circuits, and, as a proof of concept, we apply our approach to a fluxonium qubit. Specifically, we design, fabricate, and experimentally measure a fluxonium qubit coupled to a readout resonator. We compare the measured frequencies of both the qubit and the resonator to those extracted from the EPR analysis, and we find an excellent agreement. Furthermore, we compare the dispersive shift as a function of external flux obtained from experiments with our EPR analysis and a simpler lumped element model. Our findings reveal that the EPR results closely align with the experimental data, providing more accurate estimations compared to the simplified lumped element simulations.</description>

      <title>The spinorial ball (II): a manipulable qubit at human scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spinorial ball is an electronic manipulable device that we recently introduced to discuss the origin of spin-1/2 from rotations group representation, without relying on the quantum mechanics framework. Nevertheless, it is also a macroscopic visualization of a quantum two-level system, and can thus be used to gain intuition on some generic features of qubits. The present article therefore aims to complement and extend our previous work by discussing how the spinorial ball can be used to visualize quantum mechanics features. The Bloch sphere, the Hopf fibration and the Berry phase can for instance easily be seen and manipulated using this original device. We also discuss how the spinorial ball can be used to visualize Hamiltonian evolution, and we describe an explicit mapping between the ball's motion and the evolution of 1/2-spin in arbitrary magnetic field. An electronic implementation of projective measurement that matches the predictions of quantum mechanics is also proposed. The present article is written as a practical guide to manipulate the ball and establishes the exact correspondence between the spinorial ball and a generic two-level system.</description>

      <title>Constructing Multipartite Planar Maximally Entangled States from Phase States and Quantum Secret Sharing Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the construction of Planar Maximally Entangled (PME) states from phase states. PME states form a class of $n$-partite states in which any subset of adjacent particles whose size is less than or equal to half the total number of particles is in a fully entangled state. This property is essential to ensuring the robustness and stability of PME states in various quantum information applications. We introduce phase states for a set of so-called noninteracting $n$ particles and describe their corresponding separable density matrices. These phase states, although individually separable, serve as a starting point for the generation of entangled states when subjected to unitary dynamics. Using this method, we suggest a way to make complex multi-qubit states by watching how unconnected phase states change over time with a certain unitary interaction operator. In addition, we show how to derive PME states from these intricate phase states for two-, three-, four-, and K-qubit systems. This method of constructing PME states is particularly relevant for applications in fields such as quantum teleportation, quantum secret sharing, and quantum error correction, where multiparty entanglement plays a central role in the efficiency of the protocols.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Continuous Automatic Polarization Channel Stabilization from Heterodyne Detection of Coexisting Dim Reference Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking continues to encode information in polarization states due to ease and precision. The variable environmental polarization transformations induced by deployed fiber need correction for deployed quantum networking. Here we present a new method for automatic polarization compensation (APC) and demonstrate its performance on a metropolitan quantum network. Designing an APC involves many design decisions indicated by the diversity of previous solutions in the literature. Our design leverages heterodyne detection of wavelength-multiplexed dim classical references for continuous high-bandwidth polarization measurements used by newly developed multi-axis (non-)linear control algorithm(s) for complete polarization channel stabilization with no downtime. This enables continuous relatively high-bandwidth correction without significant added noise from classical reference signals. We demonstrate the performance of our APC using a variety of classical and quantum characterizations. Finally, we use C-band and L-band APC versions to demonstrate continuous high-fidelity entanglement distribution on a metropolitan quantum network with average relative fidelity of $0.94\pm0.03$ for over 30 hrs</description>

      <title>Robustness of a state with Ising topological order against local projective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fragility of a topologically ordered state, namely, the ground state of a weakly Zeeman perturbed honeycomb Kitaev model to environment induced decoherence effects mimicked by random local projective measurements. Our findings show the nonabelian Ising topological order, as quantified by a tripartite mutual information (the topological entanglement entropy $\gamma$,) is resilient to such disturbances. Further, $\gamma$ is found to evolve smoothly from a topologically ordered state to a distribution of trivial states as a function of rate of measurement (temperature). We assess our model by contrasting it with the Toric Code limit of the Kitaev model, whose ground state has abelian $Z_2$ topological order, and which has garnered greater attention in the literature of fault-tolerant quantum computation. The findings reveal the topological order in the Toric Code limit collapses rapidly as opposed to our model where it can withstand higher measurement rates.</description>

      <title>Probing the fluctuating magnetic field of Fe-triazole spin-crossover thin-layers with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ spin-crossover (SCO) complexes are materials that change their magnetic properties upon temperature variation, exhibiting a thermal hysteresis. Particularly interesting for magnetic-memory applications are thin layers of SCO complexes, where practical magnetic probing techniques are required. While conventional magnetometry on SCO complexes employs cryogenic temperatures, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are quantum magnetometers that can operate at room temperature with high spatial resolution and magnetic-field sensitivity. In this work, we apply thin layers of Fe-triazole SCO complexes directly onto a single-crystal diamond with shallow NV centers working as magnetic sensors and probe the fluctuating magnetic field. Using temperature-dependent NV-center $T_1$ measurements and a widefield technique, we find that the complexes are paramagnetic in the investigated temperature range from 20 {\deg}C to 80 {\deg}C. We quantitatively describe the $T_1$ time by a model considering the fluctuating magnetic field of the Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ ions. We see signatures of a local change of spin state in the $T_1$ relaxometry data, but structural changes in the SCO material dominate the local magnetic environment of the NV centers. Moreover, we conduct a Hahn echo to measure the $T_2$ time, which contrasts the findings of the $T_1$ times for the SCO complexes. We attribute this to different NV detection sensitivities towards Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$ and Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$ of the protocols. Our results on the magnetic properties of SCO materials highlight the capabilities of the NV center as a susceptible sensor for fluctuating magnetic fields. At the same time, a spin switching of the complexes cannot be observed due to the systematic challenges when working on nanometer distances to the SCO thin layers.</description>

      <title>Static impurity in a mesoscopic system of SU($N$) fermionic matter-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of a static impurity, modeled by a localized barrier, in a one-dimensional mesoscopic system comprised of strongly correlated repulsive SU($N$)-symmetric fermions. For a mesoscopic sized ring under the effect of an artificial gauge field, we analyze the particle density and the current flowing through the impurity at varying interaction strength, barrier height and number of components. We find a non-monotonic behaviour of the persistent current, due to the competition between the screening of the impurity, quantum fluctuations, and the phenomenon of fractionalization, a signature trait of SU($N$) fermionic matter-waves in mesoscopic ring potentials. This is also highlighted in the particle density at the impurity site. We show that the impurity opens a gap in the energy spectrum selectively, constrained by the total effective spin and interaction. Our findings hold significance for the fundamental understanding of the localized impurity problem and its potential applications for sensing and interferometry in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Advanced LIGO detector performance in the fourth observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On May 24th, 2023, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors, began the fourth observing run for a two-year-long dedicated search for gravitational waves. The LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors have achieved an unprecedented sensitivity to gravitational waves, with an angle-averaged median range to binary neutron star mergers of 152 Mpc and 160 Mpc, and duty cycles of 65.0% and 71.2%, respectively, with a coincident duty cycle of 52.6%. The maximum range achieved by the LIGO Hanford detector is 165 Mpc and the LIGO Livingston detector 177 Mpc, both achieved during the second part of the fourth observing run. For the fourth run, the quantum-limited sensitivity of the detectors was increased significantly due to the higher intracavity power from laser system upgrades and replacement of core optics, and from the addition of a 300 m filter cavity to provide the squeezed light with a frequency-dependent squeezing angle, part of the A+ upgrade program. Altogether, the A+ upgrades led to reduced detector-wide losses for the squeezed vacuum states of light which, alongside the filter cavity, enabled broadband quantum noise reduction of up to 5.2 dB at the Hanford observatory and 6.1 dB at the Livingston observatory. Improvements to sensors and actuators as well as significant controls commissioning increased low frequency sensitivity. This paper details these instrumental upgrades, analyzes the noise sources that limit detector sensitivity, and describes the commissioning challenges of the fourth observing run.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points of Completely Positive Trace-Preserving Maps in Infinite Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Completely positive trace-preserving maps $S$, also known as quantum channels, arise in quantum physics as a description of how the density operator $\rho$ of a system changes in a given time interval, allowing not only for unitary evolution but arbitrary operations including measurements or other interaction with an environment. It is known that if the Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ that $\rho$ acts on is finite-dimensional, then every $S$ must have a fixed point, i.e., a density operator $\rho_0$ with $S(\rho_0)=\rho_0$. In infinite dimension, $S$ need not have a fixed point in general. However, we prove here the existence of a fixed point under a certain additional assumption which is, roughly speaking, that $S$ leaves invariant a certain set of density operators with bounded ``cost'' of preparation. The proof is an application of the Schauder-Tychonoff fixed point theorem. Our motivation for this question comes from a proposal of Deutsch for how to define quantum theory in a space-time with closed timelike curves; our result supports the viability of Deutsch's proposal.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and State Preparation in a Two-State System of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling of two-level quantum systems to the thermal environment is a fundamental problem, with applications ranging from qubit state preparation to spin models. However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an ensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual simplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye microcavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable chemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system coupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between the two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation. In contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode system is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost equal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from Boltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of the ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected from quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in quantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.</description>

      <title>Manipulating spectral transitions and photonic transmission in a non-Hermitian optical system through nanoparticle perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this letter, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we demonstrate that by precisely manipulating the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues(or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum simulation of lower-dimensional supersymmetric lattice models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models are grounded in the intriguing concept of a hypothetical symmetry that relates bosonic and fermionic particles. This symmetry has profound implications, offering valuable extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics and fostering connections to theories of quantum gravity. However, lattice studies exploring the non-perturbative features of these models, such as spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and real-time evolution encounter significant challenges, particularly due to the infamous sign problem.
  The sign problem obstructs simulations on classical computers, especially when dealing with high-dimensional lattice systems. While one potential solution is to adopt the Hamiltonian formalism, this approach necessitates an exponential increase in classical resources with the number of lattice sites and degrees of freedom, rendering it impractical for large systems. In contrast, quantum hardware offers a promising alternative, as it requires in principle a polynomial amount of resources, making the study of these models more accessible.
  In this context, we explore the encoding of lower-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics onto qubits. We also highlight our ongoing efforts to implement and check the model supersymmetry breaking on an IBM gate-based quantum simulator with and without shot noise, addressing the technical challenges we face and the potential implications of our findings for advancing our understanding of supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced unsupervised image segmentation for medical images analysis</title>

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, necessitating the meticulous examination of mammograms by radiologists to characterize abnormal lesions. This manual process demands high accuracy and is often time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated image segmentation using artificial intelligence offers a promising alternative to streamline this workflow. However, most existing methods are supervised, requiring large, expertly annotated datasets that are not always available, and they experience significant generalization issues. Thus, unsupervised learning models can be leveraged for image segmentation, but they come at a cost of reduced accuracy, or require extensive computational resourcess. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end quantum-enhanced framework for unsupervised mammography medical images segmentation that balances between performance accuracy and computational requirements. We first introduce a quantum-inspired image representation that serves as an initial approximation of the segmentation mask. The segmentation task is then formulated as a QUBO problem, aiming to maximize the contrast between the background and the tumor region while ensuring a cohesive segmentation mask with minimal connected components. We conduct an extensive evaluation of quantum and quantum-inspired methods for image segmentation, demonstrating that quantum annealing and variational quantum circuits achieve performance comparable to classical optimization techniques. Notably, quantum annealing is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the classical optimization method in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate that this framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, including UNet-based architectures, offering a viable unsupervised alternative for breast cancer image segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing robust quantum error correction (QEC) is imperative for harnessing the promise of quantum technologies. We introduce a framework that takes {\it any} classical code and explicitly constructs the corresponding QEC code. Our framework can be seen to generalize the CSS codes, and goes beyond the stabilizer formalism~(Fig.~1). A concrete advantage is that the desirable properties of a classical code are automatically incorporated in the design of the resulting quantum code. We reify the theory by various illustrations some of which outperform the best previous constructions. We then introduce a local quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian whose ground space we analytically completely characterize. We utilize our framework to demonstrate that the ground space contains explicit quantum codes with linear distance. This side-steps the Bravyi-Terhal no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement in Crossing the Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite entanglement for a slow quantum quench crossing a critical point. We consider the quantum Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which are local and full-connected quantum systems, respectively. The multipartite entanglement is quantified by quantum Fisher information with the generator defined as the operator of the ferromagnetic order parameter. The quench dynamics begins with a ground state in a paramagnetic phase, and then the transverse field is driven slowly to cross a quantum critical point, and ends with a zero transverse field. For the quantum Ising model, based on methods of matrix product states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information density of the final state. Numerical results of both linear and nonlinear quenches show that the quantum Fisher information density of the final state scales as a power law of the quench rate, which overall conforms to the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a small correction. We show that this correction results from the long-range behaviors. We also calculate the quantum Fisher information density in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. The results show that the scaling of quantum Fisher information in this full-connected system conforms to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism better, since the long-range physics cannot be defined in this nonlocal system. Our results reveal that the multipartite entanglement provides an alternative viewpoint to understand the dynamics of quantum phase transitions, specifically, the nontrivial long-range physics.</description>

Abstract: Topological states of matter are promising resources for composing fault-tolerant quantum computers, advancing beyond the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. To enable this progress, a deep understanding of topological phenomena within actual quantum computing platforms is essential. However, existing quantum-circuit algorithms to examine topological properties remain limited. Here we introduce three quantum-circuit algorithms designed to (i) determine the ground state within a specified parity subspace, (ii) identify the many-body topological invariant, and (iii) visualize zero-energy edge modes. We illustrate these algorithms with the interacting Kitaev chain, a typical model of one-dimensional topological superconductors. These approaches are versatile, extending beyond one-dimensional systems to various topological states, including those in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Distillable entanglement under dually non-entangling operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the exact rate at which entanglement can be distilled from noisy quantum states is one of the longest-standing questions in quantum information. We give an exact solution for entanglement distillation under the set of dually non-entangling (DNE) operations -- a relaxation of the typically considered local operations and classical communication, comprising all channels which preserve the sets of separable states and measurements. We show that the DNE distillable entanglement coincides with a modified version of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement in which the arguments are measured with a separable measurement. Ours is only the second known regularised formula for the distillable entanglement under any class of free operations in entanglement theory, after that given by Devetak and Winter for (one-way) local operations and classical communication. An immediate consequence of our finding is that, under DNE, entanglement can be distilled from any entangled state. As our second main result, we construct a general upper bound on the DNE distillable entanglement, using which we prove that the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement can be strictly smaller than the regularisation of the standard relative entropy of entanglement, solving an open problem posed by Li and Winter [CMP 326, 63 (2014)]. Finally, we study also the reverse task of entanglement dilution and show that the restriction to DNE operations does not change the entanglement cost when compared with the larger class of non-entangling operations. This implies a strong form of irreversiblility of entanglement theory under DNE operations: even when asymptotically vanishing amounts of entanglement may be generated, entangled states cannot be converted reversibly.</description>

      <title>Constructions and performance of hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct families of Floquet codes derived from colour code tilings of closed hyperbolic surfaces. These codes have weight-two check operators, a finite encoding rate and can be decoded efficiently with minimum-weight perfect matching. We also construct semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes, which have improved distance scaling, and are obtained via a fine-graining procedure. Using a circuit-based noise model that assumes direct two-qubit measurements, we show that semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes can be $48\times$ more efficient than planar honeycomb codes and therefore over $100\times$ more efficient than alternative compilations of the surface code to two-qubit measurements, even at physical error rates of $0.3\%$ to $1\%$. We further demonstrate that semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes can have a teraquop footprint of only 32 physical qubits per logical qubit at a noise strength of $0.1\%$. For standard circuit-level depolarising noise at $p=0.1\%$, we find a $30\times$ improvement over planar honeycomb codes and a $5.6\times$ improvement over surface codes. Finally, we analyse small instances that are amenable to near-term experiments, including a Floquet code derived from the Bolza surface that encodes four logical qubits into 16 physical qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers progress toward outperforming classical supercomputers, but quantum errors remain their primary obstacle. The key to overcoming errors on near-term devices has emerged through the field of quantum error mitigation, enabling improved accuracy at the cost of additional run time. Here, through experiments on state-of-the-art quantum computers using up to 100 qubits, we demonstrate that without sacrificing accuracy machine learning for quantum error mitigation (ML-QEM) drastically reduces the cost of mitigation. We benchmark ML-QEM using a variety of machine learning models -- linear regression, random forests, multi-layer perceptrons, and graph neural networks -- on diverse classes of quantum circuits, over increasingly complex device-noise profiles, under interpolation and extrapolation, and in both numerics and experiments. These tests employ the popular digital zero-noise extrapolation method as an added reference. Finally, we propose a path toward scalable mitigation by using ML-QEM to mimic traditional mitigation methods with superior runtime efficiency. Our results show that classical machine learning can extend the reach and practicality of quantum error mitigation by reducing its overheads and highlight its broader potential for practical quantum computations.</description>

Abstract: The rise of the 4H-silicon-carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform marks a promising pathway towards the realization of monolithic quantum photonic networks. However, the challenge of establishing room-temperature entangled registers on these integrated photonics platforms remains unresolved. Herein, we demonstrate the first entangled processor on the SiCOI platform. We show that both deterministic generation of single divacancy electron spins and near-unity spin initialization of a single $^{13}$C nuclear spin can be achieved on SiCOI at room temperature. Besides coherently manipulating the single nuclear spin, a maximally entangled state with a fidelity of 0.89 has been prepared on this CMOS-compatible semiconductor-integrated photonics system. This work establishes the foundation for compact and on-chip solutions within existing defect-based computing and sensing protocols, positioning the SiCOI platform as the most promising candidate for integrated monolithic quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>First-order optimality conditions for non-commutative optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the state average of a polynomial of non-commuting variables, over all states and operators satisfying a number of polynomial constraints, and over all Hilbert spaces where such states and operators are defined. Such non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems are routinely solved through hierarchies of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. By formulating the general NPO problem in Lagrangian terms, we heuristically derive first-order optimality conditions via small variations in the problem variables. Although the derivation is not rigorous, it gives rise to two types of optimality conditions - state and operator - which are rigorously analyzed in the paper. Both types of conditions can be enforced through additional positive semidefinite constraints in the SDP hierarchies. State optimality conditions are shown to be satisfied by all NPO problems. For NPO problems with optimal solutions (such as, e.g., Archimedean ones) they allow enforcing a new type of constraints: namely, restricting the optimization over states to the set of common ground states of an arbitrary number of operators. Operator optimality conditions are the non-commutative analogs of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which are known to hold in many classical optimization problems. In this regard, we prove that a weak form of operator optimality holds for all NPO problems; stronger versions require the problem constraints to satisfy some qualification criterion, just like in the classical case (e.g. Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification). We test the power of the new optimality conditions by computing local properties of ground states of many-body spin systems and the maximum quantum violation of Bell inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an $N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and experimentally test a machine-learning-based method for ranking logically equivalent quantum circuits based on expected performance estimates derived from a training procedure conducted on real hardware. We apply our method to the problem of layout selection, in which abstracted qubits are assigned to physical qubits on a given device. Circuit measurements performed on IBM hardware indicate that the maximum and median fidelities of logically equivalent layouts can differ by an order of magnitude. We introduce a circuit score used for ranking that is parameterized in terms of a physics-based, phenomenological error model whose parameters are fit by training a ranking-loss function over a measured dataset. The dataset consists of quantum circuits exhibiting a diversity of structures and executed on IBM hardware, allowing the model to incorporate the contextual nature of real device noise and errors without the need to perform an exponentially costly tomographic protocol. We perform model training and execution on the 16-qubit ibmq_guadalupe device and compare our method to two common approaches: random layout selection and a publicly available baseline called Mapomatic. Our model consistently outperforms both approaches, predicting layouts that exhibit lower noise and higher performance. In particular, we find that our best model leads to a $1.8\times$ reduction in selection error when compared to the baseline approach and a $3.2\times$ reduction when compared to random selection. Beyond delivering a new form of predictive quantum characterization, verification, and validation, our results reveal the specific way in which context-dependent and coherent gate errors appear to dominate the divergence from performance estimates extrapolated from simple proxy measures.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Dissipative Dynamics of Strongly Interacting NV Centers with Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NV centers in diamond are a promising platform for highly sensitive quantum sensors for magnetic fields and other physical quantities. The quest for high sensitivity combined with high spatial resolution leads naturally to dense ensembles of NV centers, and hence to strong, long-range interactions between them. Hence, simulating strongly interacting NVs becomes essential. However, obtaining the exact dynamics for a many-spin system is a challenging task due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension, a problem that is exacerbated when the system is modelled as an open quantum system. In this work, we employ the Matrix Product Density Operator (MPDO) method to represent the many-body mixed state and to simulate the dynamics of an ensemble of NVs in the presence of strong long-range couplings due to dipole-dipole forces. We benchmark different time-evolution algorithms in terms of numerical accuracy and stability against time evolution based on exact numerical diagonalization. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics in the strong interaction regime, and study the impact of decoherence on the accuracy of the MPDO method. Lastly, we investigate the dynamics of quantum Fisher information and discuss under what circumstances a strong interaction can improve sensitivity for magnetic field sensing.</description>

Abstract: On its own, the invariance properties of Markovian master equations have mostly played a mathematical or computational role in the evaluation of quantum open system dynamics. Because all forms of the equation lead to the same time evolution for the state of the system, the fixation of a particular form has only gained physical meaning when correlated with additional information such as in the evolution of quantum trajectories or the study of decoherence-free subspaces. Here, we show that these symmetry transformations can be exploited, on their own, to optimize practical physical tasks. In particular, we present a general formulation showing how they can be used to change the measurable values of physical quantities regarding the exchange of energy and/or information with the environment. We also analyze examples of optimization in quantum thermodynamics and, finally, discuss practical implementations in terms of quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum digital signatures that can withstand coherent attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum digital signatures (QDSs), which utilize correlated bit strings among sender and recipients, guarantee the authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation of classical messages based on quantum laws. Continuous-variable (CV) quantum protocol with heterodyne and homodyne measurement has obvious advantages of low-cost implementation and easy wavelength division multiplexing. However, security analyses in previous researches are limited to the proof against collective attacks in finite-size scenarios. Moreover, existing multibit CV QDS schemes have primarily focused on adapting single-bit protocols for simplicity of security proof, often sacrificing signature efficiency. Here, we introduce a CV QDS protocol designed to withstand general coherent attacks through the use of a cutting-edge fidelity test function, while achieving high signature efficiency by employing a refined one-time universal hashing signing technique. Our protocol is proved to be robust against finite-size effects and excess noise in quantum channels. In simulation, results demonstrate a significant reduction of eight orders of magnitude in signature length for a megabit message signing task compared with existing CV QDS protocols and this advantage expands as the message size grows. Our work offers a solution with enhanced security and efficiency, paving the way for large-scale deployment of CV QDSs in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a basic computational tool in many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several noninteracting fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly log$(N)$ cost. We point out that the simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class, implying that our discovered exponential speedup is robust. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous tunneling time within the theory of time-of-arrival operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown in \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402}{\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, \textbf{108} 170402 (2012)}, that quantum tunneling is instantaneous using a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator constructed by Weyl quantization of the classical TOA. However, there are infinitely many possible quantum images of the classical TOA, leaving it unclear if one is uniquely preferred over the others. This raises the question on whether instantaneous tunneling time is simply an artifact of the chosen ordering rule. Here, we demonstrate that tunneling time vanishes for all possible quantum images of the classical arrival time, irrespective of the ordering rule between the position and momentum observables. The result still holds for TOA-operators that are constructed independent of canonical quantization, while still imposing the correct algebra defined by the time-energy canonical commutation relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-centric simulations of noncovalent interactions using a supramolecular approach. We simulate the potential energy surfaces (PES) of the water and methane dimers, featuring hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, with a sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) approach. Our simulations on quantum processors, using 27- and 36-qubit circuits, are in remarkable agreement with classical methods, deviating from complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) and coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) within 1 kcal/mol in the equilibrium regions of the PES. Finally, we test the capacity limits of the quantum methods for capturing hydrophobic interactions with an experiment on 54 qubits. These results mark significant progress in the application of quantum computing to chemical problems, paving the way for more accurate modeling of noncovalent interactions in complex systems critical to the biological, chemical and pharmaceutical sciences.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the time-dependent Dunkl-Pauli oscillator in two dimensions. We constructed the Dunkl-Pauli Hamiltonian, which incorporates a time-varying magnetic field and a harmonic oscillator characterized by time-dependent mass and frequency, initially in Cartesian coordinates. Subsequently, we reformulated the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates and analyzed the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl angular operator, deriving exact solutions using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. Our findings regarding the total quantum phase factor and wave functions reveal the significant impact of Dunkl operators on quantum systems, providing precise expressions for wave functions and energy eigenvalues. This work enhances the understanding of quantum systems with deformed symmetries and suggests avenues for future research in quantum mechanics and mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Sequential Quantum Maximum Confidence Discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential quantum information processing may lie in the peaceful coexistence of no-go theorems on quantum operations, such as the no-cloning theorem, the monogamy of correlations, and the no-signalling principle. In this work, we investigate a sequential scenario of quantum state discrimination with maximum confidence, called maximum-confidence discrimination, which generalizes other strategies including minimum-error and unambiguous state discrimination. We show that sequential state discrimination with equally high confidence can be realized only when positive-operator-valued measure elements for a maximum-confidence measurement are linearly independent; otherwise, a party will have strictly less confidence in measurement outcomes than the previous one. We establish a tradeoff between the disturbance of states and information gain in sequential state discrimination, namely, that the less a party learn in state discrimination in terms of a guessing probability, the more parties can participate in the sequential scenario.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Poisoning Attack on Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a quantum indiscriminate data poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.</description>

      <title>Automatic virtual voltage extraction of a 2x2 array of quantum dots with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in quantum dots are a compelling platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the potential to fabricate dense two-dimensional arrays with nearest neighbour couplings, a requirement to implement the surface code. However, due to the proximity of the surface gate electrodes, cross-coupling capacitances can be substantial, making it difficult to control each quantum dot independently. Increasing the number of quantum dots increases the complexity of the calibration process, which becomes impractical to do heuristically. Inspired by recent demonstrations of industrial-grade silicon quantum dot bilinear arrays, we develop a theoretical framework to mitigate the effect of cross-capacitances in 2x2 arrays of quantum dots and extend it to 2xN and NxN arrays. The method is based on extracting the gradients in gate-voltage space of different charge transitions in multiple two-dimensional charge stability diagrams to determine the system's virtual gates. To automate the process, we train an ensemble of regression models to extract the gradients from a Hough transformation of charge stability diagrams and validate the algorithm on simulated and experimental data of a 2x2 quantum dot array. Our method provides a completely automated tool to mitigate cross-capacitance effects in arrays of QDs which could be utilised to study variability in device electrostatics across large arrays.</description>

Abstract: The search for ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has been a problem of outstanding interest since Nagaoka's original proposal in 1966. Recent advances in quantum simulation have today enabled the study of tunable doped Hubbard models in ultracold atomic systems. Employing large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we establish the existence of high-spin ground states of the Hubbard model on finite-sized triangular lattices, analyze the microscopic mechanisms behind their origin, and investigate the interplay between ferromagnetism and other competing orders, such as stripes. These results explain$\unicode{x2014}$and shed new light on$\unicode{x2014}$the intriguing observations of ferromagnetic correlations in recent optical-lattice experiments. Additionally, we examine a generalized variant of the Hubbard model, wherein any second electron on a single lattice site is weakly bound compared to the first one, and demonstrate how this modification can lead to enhanced ferromagnetism, at intermediate length scales, on the nonfrustrated square lattice as well.</description>

Abstract: We report the first absolute frequency measurements for the $5s5p^{3}$P$_{0}\to5s6d^{3}$D$_{1}$ transition at 394 nm for all the stable strontium isotopes by utilizing repumping induced spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap. Absolute transition frequency is measured to be 760524409251(25) kHz for $^{88}$Sr.With reference to $^{88}$Sr, the isotope shifts are measured to be 91052(35), 54600(33), and 51641(28) kHz for $^{84}$Sr, $^{86}$Sr, and $^{87}$Sr, respectively. We calculate the hyperfine constants A and B for the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr at kHz level. Furthermore, we perform King plot analysis by combining isotope shifts on the 689-nm transition to our data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for elusive Nagaoka-type ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has recently enjoyed renewed attention with the advent of a variety of experimental platforms enabling its realization, including moir\'e materials, quantum dots, and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate a universal mechanism for Nagaoka ferromagnetism (that applies to both bipartite and nonbipartite lattices) based on the formation of ferromagnetic polarons consisting of a dopant dressed with polarized spins. Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we present a comprehensive study of the ferromagnetic polaron in an electron-doped Hubbard model, establishing various polaronic properties such as its size and energetics. Moreover, we systematically probe the internal structure of the magnetic state$\unicode{x2014}$through the use of pinning fields and three-point spin-charge-spin correlation functions$\unicode{x2014}$for both the single-polaron limit and the high-density regime of interacting polarons. Our results highlight the crucial role of mobile polarons in the birth of global ferromagnetic order from local ferromagnetism and provide a unified framework to understand the development and demise of the Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic state across dopings.</description>

      <title>Parent Hamiltonian for Fully-augmented Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07659</link>

Abstract: Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or matrix product states (MPS) is the most effective and accurate method for studying one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the application of DMRG to two-dimensional systems is not as successful because of the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. The fully augmented matrix product states (FAMPS), introduced recently in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)], extends MPS formalism to two dimensions and increases the entanglement in the wave-function ansatz, representing a significant advance in the simulation of two-dimensional quantum many-body physics. In the study of one-dimensional systems, the concept of a parent Hamiltonian for MPS has proven pivotal in the understanding of quantum entanglement. In this work, we extend this framework to two-dimensional systems. We illustrate the procedure to construct a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with given FAMPS as its exact ground state (the parent Hamiltonian for FAMPS). Additionally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm outlined in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)] in precisely identifying the FAMPS for the constructed parent Hamiltonian. The introduction of FAMPS and its associated parent Hamiltonian provides a useful framework for the future investigations of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>On the group-theoretical approach to energy quantization of a perturbed vortex ring: spectrum calculating in the pipe-type domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the problem of the energy spectrum of a quantum vortex loop moving in a thin long pipe is solved for the first time. We quantize this dynamic system using a new method, which leads to non-trivial results for circulation $\Gamma$ and energy values $E$. It is shown that the spectrum has a quasi-continuous fractal structure. In the final form, we present the spectrum of the vortex loop in the form of a ''Regge trajectory'' $E = E(\Gamma)$. The vortex quantization problem is considered outside of two-fluid hydrodynamics and other conventional approaches. We also discuss ways to improve the model, which could allow us to apply the results we've obtained to describe a quantum turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the current avenues being pursued to scale semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. Adiabatic spin qubit transfer along a chain of tunnel-coupled quantum dots is one of the possible schemes. In this scheme, we theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit that is adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, such that interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent. We analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. In addition to the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting within each dot, leading to finite $T_{2}^{*}$ for the stationary spin qubit, we consider the effects activated by detuning sweeps: failure of charge transfer due to charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to the enhancement of spin-orbit mixing at the tunnel-induced anticrossing of states localized in the two dots, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge. We show that the latter effect is activated by differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Importantly, all the error mechanisms are more dangerous at low tunnel couplings. Our results indicate that away from micromagnets, maximizing the fidelity of coherent transfer aligns with minimizing charge transfer error that was previously considered in J. A. Krzywda and L. Cywi\'nski, Phys. Rev. B 104 075439 (2021). For silicon, we suggest having tunnel coupling fulfilling $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV when one aims to coherently transfer a spin qubit across a $\sim \!10$ $\mu$m long array of $\sim \! 100$ quantum dots with error less than $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>A QCA for every SPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In three dimensions, there is a nontrivial quantum cellular automaton (QCA) which disentangles the three-fermion Walker--Wang model, a model whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes of the spacetime manifold. Here we present a conjectured generalization to higher dimensions. For an arbitrary symmetry protected topological phase of time reversal whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes, we construct a corresponding QCA that we conjecture disentangles that phase. Some of our QCA are Clifford, and we relate these to a classification theorem of Clifford QCA. We identify Clifford QCA in $4m+1$ dimensions, for which we find a low-depth circuit description using non-Clifford gates but not with Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Finite-size scaling confirms the results from the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation converge towards the thermodynamic limit. Thus, the manageable method allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in CFT with boundary symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem $A$ originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian entanglement asymmetry in random states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry measures the extent to which a symmetry is broken within a subsystem of an extended quantum system. Here, we analyse this quantity in Haar random states for arbitrary compact, semi-simple Lie groups, building on and generalising recent results obtained for the $U(1)$ symmetric case. We find that, for any symmetry group, the average entanglement asymmetry vanishes in the thermodynamic limit when the subsystem is smaller than its complement. When the subsystem and its complement are of equal size, the entanglement asymmetry jumps to a finite value, indicating a sudden transition of the subsystem from a fully symmetric state to one devoid of any symmetry. For larger subsystem sizes, the entanglement asymmetry displays a logarithmic scaling with a coefficient fixed by the dimension of the group. We also investigate the fluctuations of the entanglement asymmetry, which tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We check our findings against exact numerical calculations for the $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. We further discuss their implications for the thermalisation of isolated quantum systems and black hole evaporation.</description>
