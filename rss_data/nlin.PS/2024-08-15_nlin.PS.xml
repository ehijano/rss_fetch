      <title>Early warnings are too late when parameters change rapidly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early warning signals (EWSs) forewarn a sudden transition (or tipping) from a desirable state to an undesirable state. However, we observe that EWSs detect an impending tipping past bifurcation points when control parameters are varied fast; this questions the applicability of EWSs in real-world systems. When a control parameter is changed at a finite rate, the tipping is also delayed, providing a borrowed stability (in the parameter space) before the system tips. In this study, we use the Hurst exponent as EWS in a thermoacoustic system - a horizontal Rijke tube. We find that upon receiving an EWS alert, a quick reversal of the control parameter within the region of borrowed stability cannot always prevent tipping in real-world systems. We show this failure is due to the (i) delay in receiving the EWS alert and (ii) dispersion observed in the warning points received. For fast variation of parameters, where preventive measures fall short, we demonstrate EWS-based control actions to rescue the system after tipping. Our results in a real-world system for a fast variation of parameter highlight the limits of applicability of EWSs in preventing tipping.</description>

      <title>$\pi$ mode lasing in the non-Hermitian Floquet topological system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\pi$ modes are unique topological edge states appearing in Floquet systems with periodic modulations of the underlying lattice structure in evolution variable, such as dynamically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. These edge states are anomalous states usually appearing between Floquet replicas of the same band, even if standard topological index remains zero for this band. While linear and nonlinear $\pi$ modes were observed in conservative systems, they have never been studied in nonlinear regime in the non-Hermitian systems with structured gain and losses. Here we show that SSH waveguide array with periodically oscillating waveguide positions in propagation direction and with parity-time symmetric refractive index landscape, can support $\pi$ modes that are damped or amplified at different ends of the array. By including nonlinearity and nonlinear absorption into our continuous system, we achieve stable lasing in $\pi$ mode at one end of the array. The representative feature of this system is that lasing in it is thresholdless and it occurs even at low gain-loss amplitudes. The degree of localization of lasing $\pi$ modes can be flexibly controlled by the amplitude of transverse waveguide oscillations. This work therefore introduces a new type of topological Floquet laser and a route to manipulation of $\pi$ modes by structured gain and losses.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate for the "sound" wave the coefficient of reflection from (the coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds and the wave impedances. When only the capacitors or only the inductors are nonlinear, the coefficients are expressed in terms of the wave speeds only. We explicitly include into consideration of the shocks the dissipation, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>
