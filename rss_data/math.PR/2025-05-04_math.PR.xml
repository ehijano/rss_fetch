      <title>Nonexplosion for a large class of superlinear stochastic parabolic equations, in arbitrary spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the finite time explosion of the stochastic parabolic equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,x)=Au(t,x)+\sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x)$ in arbitrary bounded spatial domain with a large class of space-time colored noise under Neumann, periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions where $A$ is second-order self-adjoint elliptic operator and $\sigma$ grows like $\sigma(u)\approx C(1+|u|^{\chi})$ where $\chi=1+\frac{1-\eta}{2\beta}$ with $\eta$ and $\beta$ are the parameters related to the singularities of heat kernel and noise covariance kernel. We improve upon previous results by proving the theory in arbitrary spatial dimension, general elliptic operator, general space-time colored noise, a larger class of boundary conditions and proves that $\chi$ can reach the level $1+\frac{1-\eta}{2\beta}$.</description>

      <title>On Central Limit Theorems for Additive Functionals of Reversible Ergodic Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, the time reversible case of a general theorem of Bhattacharya is shown to imply the Kipnis-Varadhan functional central limit theorem for ergodic Markov processes. To this end, a few results from semigroup theory, including the resolvent identity, are incoporated in Bhattacharya's range condition for the inifinitesimal generator.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations for the facilitated exclusion process in equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the moderate deviation principles for the fluctuation fields of the facilitated exclusion process (FEP) in one dimension when the process starts from its stationary measure, both in the symmetric and asymmetric cases. The main step is to prove a super-exponential version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, which relies on the logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the FEP.</description>

      <title>The class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and mixture distributions with dominated continuous singular parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of distribution functions $F$ that have the property of rational-infinite divisibility: there exist some infinitely divisible distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1=F*F_2$. A distribution function of the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is quasi-infinitely divisible in the sense that its characteristic function admits the L\'evy-type representation with a ``signed spectral measure''. This class is a wide natural extension of the fundamental class of infinitely divisible distribution functions and it is actively studied now. We are interested in conditions for a distribution function $F$ to belong to the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ for the unexplored case, where $F$ may have a continuous singular part. We propose a criterion under the assumption that the continuous singular part of $F$ is dominated by the discrete part in a certain sense. The criterion generalizes the previous results by Alexeev and Khartov for discrete probability laws and the results by Berger and Kutlu for the mixtures of discrete and absolutely continuous laws. In addition, we describe the characteristic triplet of the corresponding L\'evy-type representation, which may contain some continuous singular part. We also show that the assumption of the dominated continuous singular part cannot be simply omitted or even slightly extended (without some special assumptions). We apply the general criterion to some interesting particular examples. We also positively solve the decomposition problem stated by Lindner, Pan and Sato within the considered case.</description>

      <title>Recurrence of the VRJP and Exponential Decay in the \(H^{2|2}\)-Model on the Hierarchical Lattice for \(d\le 2\)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the vertex-reinforced jump processes on a \(d\)-dimensional hierarchical lattice are recurrent for \(d &lt; 2\) and transient for \(d &gt; 2\). We also explore certain regimes when \(d = 2\). The proof of recurrence relies on an exponential decay estimate of the fractional moment of the Green's function, which, unlike the classical approach used for \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), requires additional entropy estimates via stability of the model distribution under coarse grain operation, which leverages its linear reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Diffusivity of the Lorentz mirror walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Lorentz mirror walk in dimension $d\geq 2$, mirrors are randomly placed on the vertices of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ at density $p\in[0,1]$. A light ray is then shot from the origin and deflected through the various mirrors in space. The object of study is the random trajectory obtained in this way, and it is of upmost interest to determine whether these trajectories are localized (finite) or delocalized (infinite). A folklore conjecture states that for $d=2$ these trajectories are finite for any density $p&gt;0$, while in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and for $p&gt;0$ small enough some trajectories are infinite. In this paper we prove that for all dimensions $d\geq 4$ and any small density $p$, the trajectories behave diffusively at all polynomial time scales $t\approx p^{-M}$ with $M&gt;1$, and in particular, they do not close by this time.</description>

Abstract: In modern telecommunications, spatial burstiness of data traffic
  poses challenges to traditional Poisson-based models. This paper
  describes application of thinning-stable point processes,
  which provide a more appropriate framework for modeling bursty
  spatial data. We discuss their properties, representation, inference

      <title>Dual Filter: A Mathematical Framework for Inference using Transformer-like Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Both the problem formulation and the proposed solution are motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture, in which a finite sequence of observations (tokens) is mapped to the conditional probability of the next token. Our objective is not to construct a mathematical model of a transformer. Rather, our interest lies in deriving, from first principles, transformer-like architectures that solve the prediction problem for which the transformer is designed. The proposed framework is based on an original optimal control approach, where the prediction objective (MMSE) is reformulated as an optimal control problem. An analysis of the optimal control problem is presented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an iterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only transformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the relationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as transport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values used in researchscale transformer models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplex slicing (Webb, 1996) is a sharp upper bound on the volume of central hyperplane sections of the regular simplex. We extend this to sharp bounds in the probabilistic framework of negative moments, and beyond, of centred log-concave random variables, establishing a curious phase transition of the extremising distribution for new sharp reverse H\"older-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>A regularity theory for evolution equations with space-time anisotropic non-local operators in mixed-norm Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the regularity of solutions to inhomogeneous time-fractional evolution equations involving anisotropic non-local operators in mixed-norm Sobolev spaces of variable order, with non-trivial initial conditions. The primary focus is on space-time non-local equations where the spatial operator is the infinitesimal generator of a vector of independent subordinate Brownian motions, making it the sum of subdimensional non-local operators. A representative example of such an operator is $(\Delta_{x})^{\beta_{1}/2}+(\Delta_{y})^{\beta_{2}/2}$. We establish existence, uniqueness, and precise estimates for solutions in corresponding Sobolev spaces. Due to singularities arising in the Fourier transforms of our operators, traditional methods involving Fourier analysis are not directly applicable. Instead, we employ a probabilistic approach to derive solution estimates. Additionally, we identify the optimal initial data space using generalized real interpolation theory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hartree NLS in 3d coming from a Many-Body Quantum System with White Noise Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the defocusing Hartree NLS with white noise external potential on T^3 i.e. the Hartree NLS whose linear part is given by the Anderson Hamiltonian. A Strichartz-type estimate is established for the Anderson Hamiltonian using perturbative arguments and the local and global well-posedness of the NLS is considered with initial data in the domain and form-domain of the Anderson Hamiltonian under different regularity assumptions on the Hartree interaction. Furthermore, we establish the Anderson Hartree NLS as an effective equation describing many-body Bosonic systems and, in particular, we prove the convergence of the linear Schr\"odinger equation for the many body system to the BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>A stochastic Gordon-Loeb model for optimal cybersecurity investment under clustered attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuous-time stochastic model for optimal cybersecurity investment under the threat of cyberattacks. The arrival of attacks is modeled using a Hawkes process, capturing the empirically relevant feature of clustering in cyberattacks. Extending the Gordon-Loeb model, each attack may result in a breach, with breach probability depending on the system's vulnerability. We aim at determining the optimal cybersecurity investment to reduce vulnerability. The problem is cast as a two-dimensional Markovian stochastic optimal control problem and solved using dynamic programming methods. Numerical results illustrate how accounting for attack clustering leads to more responsive and effective investment policies, offering significant improvements over static and Poisson-based benchmark strategies. Our findings underscore the value of incorporating realistic threat dynamics into cybersecurity risk management.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Temporal Difference Learning via Implicit Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional delta-Bose gas: skew-product relative motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Feynman-Kac-type formula for the relative motion of the two-body delta-Bose gas in two dimensions. The multiplicative functional is not exponential, and the process is a skew-product diffusion uniquely extended in law, in the sense of Erickson [30], from ${\rm BES}(0,\beta{\downarrow})$ of Donati-Martin and Yor [27] as the radial part. We give two different proofs of the formula. The first uses the original excursion characterization of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$, and the second is via the lower-dimensional Bessel processes at the expectation level. The latter proof contrasts the long-standing approach for delta-function interactions by adding mollifiers to the Laplacians since the present approximations are from "lower, fractional dimensions." Moreover, the second proof conducts a new study of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ as an SDE since we handle the drift via certain ratios of the Macdonald functions. The properties proven include the strong well-posedness and comparison of the SDE of ${\rm BES}(0,\beta\downarrow)$ for all initial conditions. In particular, this well-posedness contrasts the fact that the skew-product diffusion for the Feynman-Kac-type formula has a singular drift of $L^p_{\rm\tiny loc}$-integrability only for $ p\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Staffing under Taylor's Law: A Unifying Framework for Bridging Square-root and Linear Safety Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Staffing rules serve as an essential management tool in service industries to attain target service levels. Traditionally, the square-root safety rule, based on the Poisson arrival assumption, has been commonly used. However, empirical findings suggest that arrival processes often exhibit an ``over-dispersion'' phenomenon, in which the variance of the arrival exceeds the mean. In this paper, we develop a new doubly stochastic Poisson process model to capture a significant dispersion scaling law, known as Taylor's law, showing that the variance is a power function of the mean. We further examine how over-dispersion affects staffing, providing a closed-form staffing formula to ensure a desired service level. Interestingly, the additional staffing level beyond the nominal load is a power function of the nominal load, with the power exponent lying between $1/2$ (the square-root safety rule) and $1$ (the linear safety rule), depending on the degree of over-dispersion. Extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real arrival data show that our proposed model and staffing rules significantly outperform various alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a martingale-type characterisations for the continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) and for fractional Gaussian free fields (FGFs), using their connection to the stochastic heat equation and to fractional stochastic heat equations. The main theorem on the GFF generalizes previous results of similar flavour and the characterisation theorems on the FGFs are new. The proof strategy is to link the resampling dynamics coming from a martingale-type of decomposition property to the stationary dynamics of the desired field, i.e. to the (fractional) stochastic heat equation.</description>

First, we extend the contemporary probability theory on trees to investigate critical phenomena in a stochastic model of Yule type called Aldous-Shields-Athreya (ASA) cascade. Second, we apply the newly developed probabilistic framework to problems of uniqueness and nonuniqueness of solutions to the linear and nonlinear mean flow equations, referred to as the pantograph equation and $\alpha$-Riccati equation, respectively. The stochastic processes associated with these equations are related to each other via a one-parameter family of transformations. Remarkably, these simple transformations lead to infinitely many solutions to the initial-value problem of the nonlinear mean flow equation. Despite being non-explicit at the level of mean flow, their effect on the mean flow equations is reminiscent of how the Cole-Hopf transformation maps solutions of the heat equation to those of the Burgers equation. While the ASA cascade has been used to model percolation, ageing, and data compression, its relevance to any specific physical molecular dynamics is unclear to the authors. Nevertheless, our results highlight how simple stochastic-level transformations can uncover significant macroscopic structures. This principle is exemplified by the connection between spontaneous magnetization and shocks in the Burgers equation (Newman 1986) or the connection between the branching Brownian motion and the KPP equation (McKean 1975). In our model, the breakdown of uniqueness in mean flow solutions corresponds to critical phenomena in the ASA cascade such as stochastic explosion, hyperexplosion, and percolation.</description>

Abstract: For a given set of transmitters such as cellular base stations or WiFi access points, is it possible to analytically characterize the set of locations that are "covered" in the sense that users at these locations experience a certain minimum quality of service? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question, by providing explicit simple outer bounds and estimates for the coverage manifold. The key geometric elements of our analytical method are the Q cells, defined as the intersections of a small number of disks. The Q cell of a transmitter is an outer bound to the service region of the transmitter, and, in turn, the union of Q cells is an outer bound to the coverage manifold. In infinite networks, connections to the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference ratio allow for a scaling of the Q cells to obtain accurate estimates of the coverage manifold.</description>
