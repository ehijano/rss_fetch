      <title>The rate of extreme coronal line emitters in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LOWZ sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are a rare class of galaxy that exhibit strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines in their spectra. In some cases, these lines are transient and may be the result of tidal disruption event (TDEs). To test this connection, we calculate the rate of variable ECLEs (vECLEs) at redshift $\sim0.3$. We search for ECLEs in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LOWZ sample and discover two candidate ECLEs. Using follow-up spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, and mid-infrared observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we determine that one of these galaxies is a vECLE. Using this galaxy, we calculate the galaxy-normalized vECLE rate at redshift $\sim0.3$ to be $R_\mathrm{G}=1.6~^{+3.8}_{-1.4}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and the mass-normalized rate to be $R_\mathrm{M}=7~^{+16}_{-6}\times10^{-18}~\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This is then converted to a volumetric rate of $R_\mathrm{V}=1.8~^{+4.5}_{-1.5}\times10^{-9}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Formally, the LOWZ vECLE rates are $2-4$ times lower than the rates calculated from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Legacy sample at redshift $\sim0.1$. However, given the large uncertainties on both measurements, they are consistent with each other at $1\sigma$. Both the galaxy-normalized and volumetric rates are one to two orders of magnitude lower than TDE rates from the literature, consistent with vECLEs being caused by $5-20$ per cent of all TDEs.</description>

      <title>The observed phase space of mass-loss history from massive stars based on radio observations of a large supernova sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only $\sim 22 \%$ of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass-loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the SN-CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of a SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-non-detected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of $2 \times 10^{-6} - 10^{-4} \, \rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ for different epochs during the last 1000 years before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of $10 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$) for the progenitors of $\sim 80\%$ of the type II SNe in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for $\sim 50 \%$ of the progenitors of type II SNe in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass-loss in winds from a statistical point of view.</description>

      <title>An orphan flare from a plasma blob crossing the broad-line region ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar 3C 279 is well known for its prolific emission of rapid flares. A particular event occurred on 12/20/2013, exhibiting a large flux increase with a doubling time scale of a few hours, a very hard gamma-ray spectrum, and a time-asymmetric light curve with slow decay, but no significant variations detected in the optical range. We propose a novel scenario to interpret this flare, based on two emission zones, a stationary blob and a moving plasma blob. The stationary blob, located within the BLR, accounts for the low-state emission. The moving blob decouples from the stationary zone, accelerates and crosses the BLR. The high-energy flare is attributed to the variable external Compton emission as the blob moves through the BLR, while variations in the synchrotron emission are negligible. Our interpretation differs from previous interpretations by attributing the flare to the bulk motion and geometry of the external photon fields, without invoking varying electron injection.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Follow-up to Gravitational Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.</description>

      <title>Study of the gamma-Ray Radiation Properties of High-redshift Blazars at z&gt;2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sample of 30 high-redshift blazars ($z&gt;2.5$) by means of spectra and the radiation mechanism with Fermi Large Area Telescope $\gamma$-ray observations spanning 15 years. Three models -- the power law, power law with an exponential cutoff, and log-parabola -- are employed to analyze the spectral properties, and most sources exhibit significant curvature. The high-redshift blazars exhibit higher $\gamma$-ray luminosities and softer spectral indices compared with their low-redshift counterparts, where B3~1343+451 has the highest integrated flux, $\rm 1.13 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{\ ph \ cm^{-2} s^{-1}}$. We use a standard one-zone leptonic emission model to reproduce the spectral energy distributions of 23 sources with multiwavelength observations. We find that modeling with infrared seed photons is systematically better than with broad-line region (BLR) photons based on a $\chi^2$ test, which suggests that the $\gamma$-ray-emitting regions are most likely located outside the BLR. The fit results show that high-redshift blazars exhibit higher energy density, jet power, kinetic power, and accretion disk luminosities, along with lower synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) peak frequencies, relative to their lower-redshift counterparts. We find that blazars with higher accretion disk luminosities tend to have lower IC peak frequencies, leading to more efficient cooling of high-energy electrons. The positive correlation between jet power and accretion disk luminosity further supports the possibility of an accretion-jet connection in these high-redshift sources.</description>

      <title>Resolution requirements for numerical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.</description>

      <title>Discovery of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating newborn magnetars, which originate from binary neutron star (NS) mergers and serve as the central engines of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may leave some imprints on their prompt gamma-ray lightcurves even though they are far from their radiating fireballs. A high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) would be a unique feature for the magnetar central engine, especially a hypermassive magnetar. By conducting a systematic analysis of the prompt gamma-ray lightcurves from 605 short GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM, we have identified such QPO signals in three GRBs (e.g., GRB 120323A, GRB 181222B, and GRB 190606A). The QPOs that peaked at $1258^{+6}_{-6}$ Hz for GRB 120323A, $623^{+4}_{-4}$ Hz for GRB 181222B, and $1410^{+4}_{-5}$ Hz for GRB 190606A are all with a confidence level above 5.2 $\sigma$. The high-frequency QPO signals of those three short GRBs may be caused by a hypermassive magnetar acting as the central engine in a binary neutron star merger of binary neutron star.</description>

      <title>A flaring radio counterpart to a fast radio burst reveals a newborn magnetized engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are energetic millisecond radio bursts at cosmological distances, whose underlying engine is not identified. Among a sub-population that emit repeated radio bursts, a handful were associated with a persistent radio source (PRS) whose origin is unknown. Here we report the discovery of a compact flaring radio source (FRS) associated with a newly-active repeating FRB within one month after the first radio burst was detected. Its temporal and spectral characteristics differ from those of the PRSs but are similar to those of engine-powered supernovae and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We detected a spectral peak around $1.6\pm0.2$ GHz that is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption. Assuming equipartition, the magnetic field strength in the FRS is larger than the line-of-sight component constrained from the FRB Faraday rotation, suggesting a highly magnetized engine. The radius of the FRS is constrained to be $\sim0.03$ pc and the minimum total energy is $\sim~6.2\times{10}^{47}~{\rm ergs~}$. This FRS reveals the birth of a highly magnetized FRB engine, and hints that PRSs associated with other active FRBs may be in the later stage of evolution.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the spectral bumps of Galactic cosmic rays through gamma-ray observations of nearby molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed spectral bump in cosmic-ray (CR) proton and helium spectra, along with the phase and amplitude evolution of CR dipole anisotropy, provide plausible yet indirect evidence for the presence of a nearby CR source. This study investigates the potential of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) located near the solar system to act as natural probes of CRs from the nearby source, with their gamma-ray emissions serving as indicators of spatial variations in CR flux within the solar neighborhood resulting from this source. We show that a nearby source, accounting for the CR data, could imprint distinct features on the $\gamma$-ray spectra of different GMCs. We expect that these features are detectable by LHAASO and upcoming high-energy $\gamma$-ray observatories, providing a powerful test for the hypothesized nearby source. Notably, we find that determining the energy dependence of the $\gamma$-ray spectral index offers a promising approach to investigate the nearby source and constrain its distance. Conversely, if the spectral bump is a widespread Galactic phenomenon, the energy dependence would exhibit uniformity across all GMCs, distinguishing the underlying mechanism accounting for the spectral bump from the scenario involving a nearby source.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated simultaneous NICER plus NuSTAR observations of three neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53, XTE J1739-285 and MAXI J1816-195 using the latest reflection models, with the seed photons feeding into the corona originating from either the neutron star (NS) or the accretion disk. We found that, for the sources in the hard spectral state, more than $\sim$ 50% of the NS photons enter into the corona if NS provides seed photons, while only $\sim$ 3%-5% disk photons go to the corona if seed photons come from the disk. This finding, together with the derived small height of the corona, favors the lamp-post geometry or boundary layer scenario where the corona is close to the central neutron star. Additionally, we found that the source of the seed photons has big influence in the significance of the NS radiation, especially for the soft spectral state. This result may help explain why the NS radiation in MAXI J1816-195 is weak in the previous work. More importantly, for the first time, we explored the properties of the corona in the NS systems with the compactness ($l-\theta$) diagram. We found that the corona in the NS systems all lie in the left side of the pair-production forbidden region, away from the predicted pair-production lines. This finding indicates that either the corona in these NS systems is not pair-dominated, possibly due to the additional cooling from NS photons, or the corona is composed of both thermal and non-thermal electrons.</description>

      <title>Revealing two orthogonally polarized spectral components in Vela X-1 with IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric observations of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) have provided us with the key to unlocking their geometrical properties. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) the geometries of several XRPs have been determined, providing new insights into their emission mechanisms and magnetic field structures. Previously, Vela X-1 has proven to be exceptional in demonstrating a clear energy dependence of its polarimetric properties, showing a 90$^{\circ}$ swing in the polarization angle (PA) between low and high energies. Due to the complex energy-dependent nature of the polarization properties, it was not possible to determine the pulsar geometry. In this work, we present the results of a detailed analysis of the pulse phase-resolved polarization properties of at different energies. By separating the polarimetric analysis into low and high energy ranges, we are able to disentangle the contributions of the soft and hard spectral components to the polarization, revealing the pulse phase dependence of polarization degree (PD) and PA in each energy band. The PA pulse phase dependence at high energies (5$-$8 keV) allows us, for the first time, to determine the pulsar geometry in Vela X-1. The fit with the rotating vector model gives an estimate for the pulsar spin position angle at around 127$^{\circ}$ and for the magnetic obliquity of 13$^{\circ}$. In order to explain the 90$^{\circ}$ swing in PA between high and low energies, we discuss two possible scenarios: a two-component spectral model and the vacuum resonance.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray transport and acceleration in an evolving shock landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sources of cosmic rays between the knee and the ankle are still debated. The Galactic wind and its termination shock have been proposed to contribute to this transition between Galactic and extragalactic origin, but another possibility is large-scale shock structures from local sources in the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate CR transport in a time-dependent landscape of shocks in the Galactic halo. These shocks could result from local outbursts, e.g. starforming regions and superbubbles. CRs re-accelerated at such shocks can reach energies above the knee. Since the shocks are closer to the Galaxy than a termination shock and CRs escape downstream, they can propagate back more easily. With such outbursts happening frequently, shocks will interact. This interaction could adjust the CR spectrum, particularly for the particles that are able to be accelerated at two shocks simultaneously. The transport and acceleration of CRs at the shock is modeled by Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) within the public CR propagation framework CRPropa. We developed extensions for time-dependent wind profiles and for the first time connected the code to hydrodynamic simulations, which were run with the public Athena++ code. We find that, depending on the concrete realization of the diffusion tensor, a significant fraction of CRs can make it back to the Galaxy. These could contribute to the observed spectrum around and above the CR knee ($E \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$). In contrast to simplified models, a simple power-law does not describe the energy spectra well. Instead, for single shocks, we find a flat spectrum ($E^{-2}$) at low energies, which steepens gradually until it reaches an exponential decline. When shocks collide, the energy spectra transiently become harder than $E^{-2}$ at high energies.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Astrophysically Relevant Pair Beam Instabilities in a Laboratory Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of TeV blazars emitted gamma-rays with the extragalactic background photons gives rise to a relativistic beam of electron-positron ($e^- e^+$) pairs propagating through the intergalactic medium, producing a cascade through up-scattering low-energy photons. Plasma instability is considered one of the underlying energy-loss processes of the beams. We employ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the plasma instabilities of ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating in a denser background plasma, using the parameters designed to replicate astrophysical jets under laboratory conditions. In an astrophysical scenario with a broad, dilute beam, electromagnetic instability can be disregarded because its growth rate is slower than that of electrostatic instability, indicating the electromagnetic modes are suppressed. We calculate the physical limit of density contrast at which a warm beam achieves suppression of electromagnetic instabilities in laboratory experiments, consistent with the physically relevant conditions for Blazar-induced beams. We have used a composite Cauchy distribution for the beam particles, which is more realistic in representing the non-Maxwellian nature of pair beams, improving upon previous studies. We investigate the interplay between the magnetic field forming from localized currents and transverse beam momentum spread. We extrapolate to the non-linear feedback of instability where the beam is energetically broadened. We observe that the instability generates a negligible angular broadening for Blazar-Induced beams.</description>

      <title>Extracting the X-ray reverberation response functions from the AGN light curves using an autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the X-ray reverberation in active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a machine-learning algorithm widely used for signal processing and feature reconstruction. While the X-ray reverberation signatures that contain the information of the accretion disk and the X-ray emitting corona are commonly analyzed in the Fourier domain, this work aims to extract the reverberation response functions directly from the AGN light curves. The VAE is trained using the simulated light curves that contain the primary X-rays from the lamp-post corona varying its height and the corresponding reflection X-rays from the disk. We use progressively more realistic light-curve models, such as those that include the effects of disk-propagating fluctuations and random noises, to assess the ability of the VAE to reconstruct the response profiles. Interestingly, the VAE can recognize the reverberation patterns on the light curves, hence the coronal height can be predicted. We then deploy the VAE model to the XMM-Newton data of IRAS 13224-3809 and directly estimate, for the first time, the response functions of this source in various observations. The result reveals the corona changing its height between $3~r_{\rm g}$ and $20~r_{\rm g}$, which is correlated with the source luminosity and in line with previous literature. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this method.</description>

      <title>Thermal Spectra of Warped and Broken Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes may accrete gas with angular momentum vectors misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The resulting accretion disks are subject to Lense-Thirring precession, and hence torque. Analytical calculations and simulations show that Lense-Thirring precession will warp, and, for large misalignments, fracture the disk. In GRMHD simulations, the warping or breaking occurs at $\lesssim10r_s$, where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Considering that accretion disk spectra in the soft state of stellar-mass black holes are generally well modeled as multicolor blackbodies, the question arises as to how consistent warped and broken disks are with observations. Here, we analytically calculate thermal spectra of warped and broken disks with a warp or break radius at $10r_s$ for various disk inclinations. Due to self-irradiation and the projected area of the inclined disk regions, the spectra of inclined disks significantly deviate from multicolor blackbodies and do not follow the multicolor blackbody relation $\nu L_\nu\propto\nu^{\gamma}=\nu^{4/3}$ at low frequencies $\nu$. The power-law indices at low frequencies of the inclined disks vary with viewing angle; when viewed face-on, they vary between $\gamma\approx0.91-1.26$ for the warped disks and $\gamma\approx1.37-1.54$ for the broken disks depending on the inclination angle. The differences decrease when moving the location of the disk warp and break to larger radii; for inclined disks to emit as multicolor blackbodies, they must warp or break at radii $\geq50r_s$. Our results imply that accretion disks around black holes in the soft state warp or break at larger radii than suggested in GRHMD simulations.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Estimating Black Hole Masses in Obscured AGN from X-ray and Optical Emission Line Luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test a novel method for estimating black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) in obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) that uses proxies to measure the full-width half maximum of broad H$\alpha$ (FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$) and the accretion disk luminosity at 5100 Angstrom ($\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$). Using a published correlation, we estimate FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ from the narrow optical emission line ratio $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$. Using a sample of 99 local obscured AGN from the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey, we assess the agreement between estimating $\lambda L_{\rm 5100 Angstrom}$ from the intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and from narrow optical emission lines. We find a mean offset of $0.32 \pm 0.68$ dex between these methods, which propagates to a factor of $\sim$2 uncertainty when estimating $M_{\rm BH}$ using a virial mass formula where $L_{\rm [O\,III]}/L_{\rm nH\beta}$ serves as a proxy of FWHM$_{\rm bH\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$). We compare $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ with virial $M_{\rm BH}$ measurements from broad Paschen emission lines. For the 14 (12) BASS AGN with broad Pa$\alpha$ (Pa$\beta$) detections, we find $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to be systematically higher than $M_{\rm BH,Pa\alpha}$ ($M_{\rm BH,Pa\beta}$) by a factor of 0.39 $\pm$ 0.44 dex (0.48 $\pm$ 0.51 dex). Since these offsets are within the scatter, more data are needed to assess whether $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ is biased high. For 151 BASS AGN with measured stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm *}$), we find that the $\sigma_{\rm *}$-derived $M_{\rm BH}$ agrees with $M_{\rm BH,[O\,III]/nH\beta}$ to within 0.08 dex, albeit with wide scatter (0.74 dex). The method tested here can provide estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ in thousands of obscured AGN in spectroscopic surveys when other diagnostics are not available, though with an uncertainty of $\sim$3-5.</description>

      <title>Dynamical features and shadows of quantum Schwarzschild black hole in effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry involving leading one-loop long-distance quantum effects, which arise within the framework of effective field theories of gravity. Our analysis reveals that geodesic trajectories of both massive and massless particles can assume completely different behaviors depending on the sign assumed by the quantum contributions, in spite of their smallness. Moreover, we find that the positions of stable and unstable circular orbits are determined by an algebraic quartic equation, which we solve by developing a straightforward and analytic method. Additionally, we examine black hole shadows and rings by means of two different emission profile models, which account for quantum corrections to the innermost stable circular orbit and photon sphere radii. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of the black hole are also derived. Finally, we draw our conclusions.</description>

      <title>ALPs production from Light Primordial Black Holes: the role of Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light Primordial Black Holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$ g $\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$ g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both Dark Matter and Dark Radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$ MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as moduli, predicted by String Theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called Superradiance Instability in the case of spinning PBHs. These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by Superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study here such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordial black holes. The potentials for inflation are chosen to be a general polynomial in its scalar field $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the inflationary field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) fall within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.    Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.    Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.     Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise  or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Models for Black Hole Accretion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations are an indispensable tool in studying accretion onto compact objects. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) frequently uses libraries of ideal GRMHD simulations to interpret polarimetric, event-horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. In this work, we present a library of ten non-radiative, ideal GRMHD simulations that were utilized by the EHT Collaboration in their analysis of Sagittarius A*. The parameter survey explores both low (SANE) and high (MAD) magnetization states across five black hole spins $a_{*}=-15/16,-1/2,0,+1/2,+15/16$ where each simulation was run out to $30,000\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{3}$. We find the angular momentum and energy flux in SANE simulations closely matches the thin-disk value, with minor deviations in prograde models due to fluid forces. This leads to spin equilibrium around $a_{*}\sim0.94$, consistent with previous studies. We study the flow of conserved quantities in our simulations and find mass, angular momentum, and energy transport in SANE accretion flows to be primarily inward and fluid-dominated. MAD models produce powerful jets with outflow efficiency $&gt;1$ for $a_{*}=+0.94$, leading to black hole spin-down in prograde cases. We observe outward directed energy and angular momentum fluxes on the horizon, as expected for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. MAD accretion flows are sub-Keplerian and exhibit greater variability than their SANE counterpart. They are also hotter than SANE disks within $r\lesssim 10\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{GM/c}^{2}$. This study is accompanied by a public release of simulation data at \url{http://thz.astro.illinois.edu/}.</description>

      <title>Could the neutrino emission of TXS 0506+056 come from the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos from the blazar TXS 0506+056 are usually thought to arise from the relativistic jet pointing to us. However, the composition of jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or Poynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays and neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether the neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow of the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic reconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is needed. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a steady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux from TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically arrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE) regime of accretion. In the MAD scenario, due to a high magnetic field, a large dissipation radius is required to avoid the cooling of protons due to the synchrotron emission.</description>

      <title>Distinct photon-ALP propagation modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of cosmic photons may reveal their propagation in the interstellar environment, thereby offering a promising way to probe axions and axion-like particles (ALPs). Numerical methods are usually used to compute the propagation of the photon-ALP beam due to the complexity of both the interstellar magnetic field and the evolution equation. However, under certain conditions, the evolution equation can be greatly simplified so that the photon-ALP propagation can be analytically solved. By using analytic methods, we find two distinct photon-ALP propagation modes, determined by the relative magnitude of the photon-ALP mixing term in comparison to the photon attenuation term. In one mode, the intensity of photons decreases with the increasing distance; in the other mode, it also exhibits oscillatory behavior. To distinguish the two propagation modes, we compute the observable quantities such as the photon survival probability and the degree of polarization. We also determine through analytic methods the conditions under which maximum polarization can be observed and the corresponding upper bound of the survival probability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Best of both worlds: Fusing hyperspectral data from two generations of spectro-imagers for X-ray astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15639</link>

Abstract: With the launch of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the advent of microcalorimeter detectors, X-ray astrophysics is entering in a new era of spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy. But while this new generation of X-ray telescopes have much finer spectral resolutions than their predecessors (e.g. XMM-Newton, Chandra), they also have coarser spatial resolutions, leading to problematic cross-pixel contamination. This issue is currently a critical limitation for the study of extended sources such as galaxy clusters or supernova remnants. To increase the scientific output of XRISM's hyperspectral data, we propose to fuse it with XMM-Newton data, and seek to obtain a cube with the best spatial and spectral resolution of both generations. This is the aim of hyperspectral fusion. In this article, we have implemented an algorithm that jointly deconvolves the spatial response of XRISM and the spectral response of XMM-Newton. To do so, we construct a forward model adapted for instrumental systematic degradations and Poisson noise, then tackle hyperspectral fusion as a regularized inverse problem. We test three methods of regularization: low rank approximation with Sobolev regularization; low rank approximation with 2D wavelet sparsity ; and 2D-1D wavelet sparsity. We test our method on toy models constructed from hydrodynamic simulations of supernova remnants. We find that our method reconstructs the ground truth well even when the toy model is complex. For the regularization term, we find that while the low rank approximation worked well as a spectral denoiser in models with less spectral variability, it introduced a bias in models with more spectral variability, in which case the 2D-1D wavelet sparsity regularization worked best. After demonstrating a proof of concept in this article, we aim to apply this method to real X-ray astrophysical data in the near future.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>

Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids on-board inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10\,$AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30\,$AU and $\sim 10\,$Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with $20\,$cm mirrors or $5\,$m radio dishes, although for the laser case this would require lower laser frequency noise relative to the LISA lasers. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>
