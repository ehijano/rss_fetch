      <title>Phase-Induced Particle Creation in the Kappa-Gamma Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter ($\kappa, \gamma$) family of field modes in flat spacetime that generalizes the recently developed $\kappa$-plane wave modes, which correspond to real squeezing. By incorporating a phase parameter, $\gamma$, our new kappa gamma plane wave modes describe a vacuum state, $| 0_{\kappa,\gamma} \rangle$, characterized by continuous-mode phase squeezing, where $\kappa$ governs the squeezing magnitude and $\gamma$ sets its angle. This generalization reveals a novel physical effect: particle creation induced purely by a relative phase shift between observers. The particle spectrum is shown to be a function of this phase difference and the deformation parameter $\kappa$. This work provides a comprehensive framework for exploring a new class of non-trivial quantum vacua, where both thermal and squeezing properties can be continuously adjusted.</description>

      <title>The Neural Networks with Tensor Weights and the Corresponding Fermionic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation. The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional. It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>On tests for baby universes in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address a puzzle by Antonini and Rath -- where a single CFT state has two bulk duals, one with a baby universe and one without -- Engelhardt and Gesteau recently devised a test for baby universes in AdS/CFT. Using the extrapolate dictionary, they showed that the boundary dual of a bulk swap test favored bulk spacetimes without a baby universe, providing evidence against their semiclassical validity. However, recent work suggests that holographic maps should post-select on such closed universes, and we argue that this is consistent with the extrapolate dictionary. We therefore construct a new holographic map for bulk states with baby universes and use this to show that the swap test cannot distinguish between Antonini and Rath's two candidate bulk duals. This not only allows for a valid semiclassical description of the baby universe, but also enables the application of recent techniques for including observers in holographic maps.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>

      <title>Moduli Self-Fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Quantum Gravity (QG), large moduli values lead to towers of exponentially light states, making the QG cut-off field-dependent. In 4D supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, this cut-off is set by the species scale $\Lambda(z_i, \bar{z}_i)$, where $z_i$ are complex moduli. We argue that in GKP-like 4D no-scale vacua, accounting for this field dependence generates one-loop, positive-definite potentials for the otherwise unfixed moduli, with local Minkowski minima at the desert points in moduli space with $z_i \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. As these no-scale moduli grow, a dS plateau emerges and, for larger moduli, the potential runs away to zero, consistent with Swampland expectations. This may have important consequences for the moduli fixing problem. In particular non-perturbative superpotentials may not be necessary for fixing the K\"ahler moduli in a Type IIB setting. Although one loses control over non-perturbative corrections, we argue that modular invariance (more generally, dualities) of the species scale may give us information about the behaviour at small moduli in some simple cases. We illustrate this mechanism in a Type II 4D $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ toroidal orientifold, where in some cases, modular invariance can give us control over the non-perturbative corrections. The vanishing cosmological constant reflects a delicate cancellation between IR and UV contributions at the minimum. The models may be completed by the addition of intersecting D6-branes, yielding a 3-generation MSSM (RR tadpole free) model with some (but not all) closed string moduli fixed in Minkowski, with the complex structure moduli fixed at the desert points.</description>

      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry II: Catalogue of all torsion-like theories including new ghost-tachyon-free cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of consistent effective field theories in the infrared demands that models be defined by their underlying gauge symmetries, rather than by an arbitrary tuning of couplings or a cherry-picking of operators which may not be stable against radiative corrections. Adhering to this principle, we systematically derive all linear, parity-conserving models that propagate a pair-antisymmetric rank-three field on a Minkowski background. Such models are relevant not only to torsion, but to many areas in high-energy physics ranging from dual graviton formulations to string theory and higher-spin theories. Following this exhaustive classification, we extract several unitary models. In the context of torsion, the results are remarkable. None of the models we obtain propagate scalar or pseudoscalar torsion, in stark contrast to the literature focus. Instead, all models propagate one or more vector torsion modes.</description>

      <title>Instanton Moduli, Topology and the Bosonic/Heterotic String Origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new supersymmetric NS(-1)-branes supported by the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ 't Hooft instantons in ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity. We show that although the magnetic 3-form string flux is invariant under the variation of instanton moduli, the string-frame metric can change topology, giving rise to either $\mathbb R^4$ or the new $\mathbb R\times S^3$ bolt topologies. We uplift the solutions to both heterotic and bosonic strings, where the instanton moduli become parameters of pure geometry. We find that the Killing spinors exist in both theories. The transformation of the Killing spinors from one theory to the other is consistent with the recently proposed bosonic/heterotic string duality. We further construct new BPS solutions in the $D=6$ Salam-Sezgin model, employing the technique developed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Double spacelike collinear limits from multi-Regge kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering amplitudes and form factors in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory in the limit where two pairs of gluons become collinear. We find that, when the virtualities of both collinear pairs are spacelike, the collinear factorisation of the amplitude involves a generalised splitting amplitude that correlates the two collinear directions, confirming a recent proposal in the literature. Remarkably, we find that our generalised splitting amplitude agrees with the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) subtracted six-point amplitude in multi-Regge kinematics. The latter can be explicitly evaluated using integrability to all orders in the coupling. We also present compelling evidence for the universality of the generalised splitting amplitude, by showing that the same function governs the double spacelike collinear limit of scattering amplitudes with up to 8 particles and 3 loops and form factors with up to 6 particles and 2 loops.</description>

      <title>Untangling Selberg from the Wilson spool: 1-loop determinants and trace formulae in (A)dS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading quantum effects in perturbative quantum gravity are captured by functional determinants of kinetic operators. We study such 1-loop determinants in three-dimensional Euclidean (anti-) de Sitter gravity evaluated using two seemingly disparate tools, the Selberg zeta function and the Wilson spool. For the Euclidean BTZ black hole, we demonstrate the Wilson spool for massive bosons of arbitrary spin directly equates to a representation-theoretic version of the Selberg zeta function. In the case of Euclidean de Sitter, we show a new trace formula associated with the Fredholm determinant for the scalar Laplacian on the three-sphere reproduces the Wilson spool. Generalizing the trace formula, we comment on how to extend this Wilson spool construction to lens space quotients and higher-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Headrick, Sasieta and myself provides an extension of the HRT formula for asymptotically flat spacetimes. I use this formula to construct a holographic model of black hole evaporation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes using Brill-Lindquist (BL) wormholes. The wormhole is interpreted via ER=EPR to represent the entanglement geometry between an evaporating black hole and baths into which the Hawking radiation is collected. Applying HRT, I compute the entanglement entropy by numerically computing the areas of the minimal surfaces, which is shown to obey the Page curve, consistent with information conservation. Numerical analysis is done for both three and four-boundary BL wormholes ($n=3,4$). Index-1 surfaces in the wormhole interior are interpreted as the candidate bulges involved in the python's lunch conjecture (PLC), and their areas are used to compute the restricted complexity $\mathcal{C}$ of decoding the Hawking radiation. The results are compared to the time-dependent predictions of the PLC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wilson spool is a prescription for expressing one-loop determinants as topological line operators in three-dimensional gravity. We extend this program to describe massive spinning fields on all smooth, cusp-free, solutions of Euclidean gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our prescription makes use of the expression of such solutions as a quotients of hyperbolic space. The result is a gauge-invariant topological operator, which can be promoted to an off-shell operator in the gravitational path integral about a given saddle-point. When evaluated on-shell, the Wilson spool reproduces and extends the known results of one-loop determinants on hyperbolic quotients. We motivate our construction of the Wilson spool from multiple perspectives: the Selberg trace formula, worldline quantum mechanics, and the quasinormal mode method.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Newton-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic Newton-Cartan limit of higher-order gravity theories in arbitrary dimensions. We first study it at the level of the action by introducing an additional 1-form gauge field and coupling it appropriately to the gravity sector. We extend this procedure to any theory whose Lagrangian is a function of the Ricci scalar, quadratic Ricci tensor and quadratic Riemann tensor. We also study the limit of the equations of motion for two models, Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and quadratic Ricci scalar theory. We prove that, in the first case, it is possible to obtain the Poisson equation by introducing a scalar field and imposing an appropriate constraint. In the latter case, we show that it is possible to get the Poisson equation from the limit of the equations of motion as long as the on-shell constraint used in the two-derivative theory is supplemented with a further condition. We give the expressions of the two higher-order corrected Poisson equations in terms of curvatures of Newton-Cartan geometry. In both cases, we derive the full set of non-relativistic equations and study their boost transformations. The two sets of equations of motion define zero-torsion Gauss-Bonnet Newton-Cartan gravity and zero-torsion quadratic Ricci scalar Newton-Cartan gravity.</description>

Abstract: We study fermion zero-mode wave functions with various chiralities in magnetized $T^{2g}$, $(g=2,3)$ torus. First, we consider the wave functions satisfying the Dirac equation and the boundary conditions on the magnetized torus. Second, we introduce the $SO(3)$ (or parity) transformations and derive the wave functions under the modular transformation. Additionally, we calculate the Yukawa couplings with consideration for the chirality. Lastly, we briefly review how to construct $T^{4}/\mathbb{Z}_N$ ($N=2,3,4,6$) and $T^6/\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ twisted orbifold. Also, we explicitly analyze the number of the wave functions in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of gravitational interactions for massive higher spins extending our previous work on massive spin 3/2 and spin 2 to massive spin 5/2, including partially massless and massless limits. We use the gauge invariant frame-like description for massive fields, both for general analysis of possible vertices and for constructing the minimal vertex (i.e. vertex containing standard minimal interactions and non-minimal interactions with a minimum number of derivatives). In particular, we show that there is a special point m^2 = 4\Lambda, which corresponds to the boundary of a unitary allowed region in dS_4, where minimal interactions disappear, leaving only non-minimal ones.</description>

      <title>The setting sun diagram with complex external momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the issue of analytically continuing Feynman integrals from Euclidean to Minkowski signature, allowing for generic complex momenta. Although this is well-known in terms of the K\"all\'{e}n-Lehmann representation, we consider potential alternative takes on the same problem and discuss how these are not necessarily equivalent to the K\"all\'en-Lehmann integral outcome. We present our analysis for a simple enough case -- the setting sun diagram in $d=2$ with a real mass -- but already with an eye out to the more general case with complex masses which will further complicate matters.</description>

      <title>Three-loop singularity structure for a non-linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the three-loop renormalization of the effective action for a two-dimensional non-linear sigma model using the background field method and a cutoff regularization in the coordinate representation. The coefficients of the renormalization constant and the necessary auxiliary vertices are found, as well as the asymptotic expansions of all three-loop diagrams, and their dependence on the type of regularizing function. A comparison is also made with the standard case of cutoff in the momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic supergravity in ten dimensions and anomaly cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a ten-dimensional version of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau five-fold that reproduces the classical Maurer-Cartan equation governing supersymmetric heterotic moduli. Quantising this theory's quadratic fluctuations, we show that its one-loop partition function simplifies to products of holomorphic Ray-Singer torsions and exhibits an anomaly that factorises as in $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ supergravity. Based on this, we conjecture that this theory is the $SU(5)$-twisted version of ten-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to Yang-Mills and show that is related to the type I Kodaira-Spencer theory of Costello-Li via a non-local field redefinition. The counter-terms needed to cancel the anomaly and retain gauge invariance for the one-loop effective theory reconstruct the differential of a recently discovered double-extension complex. This complex has non-tensorial extension classes and its first cohomology counts the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic compactifications modulo order $\alpha'^2$ corrections.</description>

Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation of black hole complementarity based on recent rules for including the observer in quantum cosmology. We argue that this provides a self-consistent treatment of the interior of an evaporating black hole throughout its history, as well as the Antonini-Sasieta-Swingle-Rath configuration where a closed universe is entangled with a pair of AdS universes.</description>

      <title>Gluing two discs into a spindle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct AdS$_5 \times \Sigma$ solutions of $D=7$ gauged supergravity where $\Sigma$ is a disc, also known as a half-spindle, and uplift them to $D=11$ supergravity. By computing the anomaly polynomial of the M5-brane theory compactified on $\Sigma$ in the large $N$ limit, we obtain the off-shell central charges of the dual $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory to disc solutions. These off-shell central charges decompose into contributions from the center and the boundary of the disc and are referred to as the gravitational blocks for disc. By suitably gluing the gravitational blocks for two discs along their boundaries, we reproduce the off-shell central charge for a single spindle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was discovered in recent months that the anti-de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds involved in all familiar top-down examples of AdS/CFT duality follow from applying a transverse nonrelativistic brane limit to string/M theory on (asymptotically) flat spacetime. In this note we show that an exactly analogous statement holds for de Sitter (dS) backgrounds relevant to particular instances of dS/CFT duality, which are obtained via a longitudinal Carrollian brane limit. This statement makes direct contact with the holographic duality inferred by Hull via temporal T-duality.</description>

      <title>Partial Compositeness: from Anarchy to Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Composite Higgs paradigm, Partial Compositeness has emerged as an elegant mechanism for generating large flavor hierarchies such as are observed in the quark and lepton masses and mixings. This mechanism exploits the strong renormalization group effects of the compositeness dynamics when these are {\it not} flavor-symmetric. Despite its remarkable properties, at this point it is stringently constrained by the body of flavor- and CP-violation tests, so that the compositeness scale must be at least $O(100)$ TeV, beyond the direct reach of proposed colliders. On the other hand, Composite Higgs theories with flavor-symmetric strong dynamics, but with realistic flavor-violating hierarchies introduced in an ad hoc manner, can extend the GIM mechanism of the standard model and thereby be far less constrained, at the edge of LHC reach and well within reach of future colliders. We show how the best features of both these types of dynamics can be combined if flavor-symmetries of the strong composite dynamics are emergent in the IR near the compositeness scale but absent in the far UV. In this case, flavor hierarchies can be generated by the renormalization group flow in the UV, followed by an IR stage in which the dynamics flows towards accidental flavor and CP symmetries. We point out how the collider and low-energy phenomenology is significantly impacted by the IR stage. Our analysis includes a discussion of the distinctive features of the small neutrino masses and their large mixings.</description>

      <title>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</description>

      <title>SymTFT Approach for Mixed States with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries. The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong (non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis informed by the SymTFT framework.</description>

      <title>Interaction-enhanced quantum to classical crossover temperature in a Luttinger liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electrical and thermal transport in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid coupled to a three-dimensional acoustic phonon in both the ``clean" (umklapp scattering) and ``dirty" (disorder scattering) limits using the memory matrix formalism. By explicitly incorporating the Debye cutoff on phonon frequencies, we consider the low and high temperature transport regimes. We find the crossover temperature separating these two regimes to be interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions increasing the crossover temperature by at most an order of magnitude. This provides an illustration for how interactions can enhance the low-temperature scattering regime in an interacting Fermi system.</description>

      <title>The Creation of Particles in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document is the Ph.D. thesis of Leonard Parker, submitted to Harvard University in 1966. Over the decades, several generations of physicists have been introduced to the concept of particle creation by gravitational fields, a phenomenon that has become a cornerstone in exploring the interplay between gravitation and quantum theory. Yet, the foundational breakthrough that led to the prediction and understanding of this phenomenon remains unfamiliar to many. In the interest of historical accuracy and in recognition of a seminal contribution to physics, the thesis has been retyped and made it freely available as an open-access (arXiv) document. The reissued thesis is accompanied by a Foreword that places the work in its proper historical context.
  As the team responsible for this new edition, we (Antonio Ferreiro, Jos\'e Navarro-Salas, and Silvia Pla) hope that future generations will continue to draw inspiration from this pioneering text.</description>

      <title>Tribrid Inflation, Type II Leptogenesis, and Observable Gravitational Waves in $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concrete realization of tribrid inflation within the framework of the gauge group $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. In this model, inflation is driven by the neutral components of left-handed Higgs triplets, which also play a central role in generating the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via non-thermal leptogenesis. Tiny neutrino masses arise naturally through a type-II seesaw mechanism, facilitated by right-handed triplet fields. Supergravity corrections, stemming from the leading-order terms in a non-minimal K\"ahler potential, are essential in bringing the predictions of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into agreement with the latest cosmological data, including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6, Planck 2018, and LB-BK18. A key feature of this model is the existence of a viable parameter space that predicts potentially observable primordial gravitational waves, with a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.005$, placing it within reach of upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>PINNs Study for the Bekki-Nozaki Chaos in the Non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study chaotic behavior in the forced dissipative non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so called the Bekki-Nozaki equation. Chaotic systems are often seen in a strong sensitivity to initial conditions,leading to error accumulation over time when traditional numerical methods are applied. To address this difficulty, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs), a mesh-free deep learning framework. PINNs mitigate error accumulation in chaotic systems by solving partial differential equations without discretizing the computational domain. We demonstrate that PINNs successfully reproduce chaotic behavior of the Bekki-Nozaki equation. The results of the inverse analysis indicate a correlation between the governing equation's predictability and its chaotic nature of the solution.</description>

      <title>Mixed states for reference frames transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the properties of black holes using a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics called modified Maxwell (ModMax), in conjunction with nonlinear massive gravity known as dRGT-like massive gravity. We start by deriving the exact black hole solutions within the framework of ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity and analyze how the parameters of both ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity influence the characteristics of these black holes. Additionally, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities for these black holes in the non-extended phase space and investigate how the parameters of ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity affect these quantities. We confirm that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We also examine local stability by analyzing heat capacity and assess how ModMax and the massive parameters influence phase transitions and physical limitation points. Next, we expand our analysis to the extended phase space, demonstrating that these thermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation in this context. Finally, we examine the isoperimetric ratio of black holes in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity.</description>

      <title>SMEFT ATLAS: The Landscape Beyond the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) based on the unbroken gauge group $\text{SU(3)}_C\otimes\text{SU(2)}_L\otimes\text{U(1)}_Y$ and containing only particles of the Standard Model (SM) has developed in the last decade to a mature field. It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales sufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at which new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory with a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics (NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our review, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$ scattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten classes and list for each class the most relevant operators and the corresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the correlations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and the $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight into the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will facilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible anomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables, while representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to the electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950 references to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of this field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their interplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different landscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars, vector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method, termed discontinuity calculus, for computing discontinuities of complex functions. This framework enables a systematic investigation of both analytic continuation and the topological structure of Riemann surfaces. We apply this calculus to analyze the analytic continuation of partial-wave amplitudes in two-body coupled-channel scattering problems and discuss their uniformization of the corresponding Riemann surfaces. This methodology offers new perspectives and tools for analyzing coupled-channel scattering problems in quantum scattering theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) framework to open quantum systems. Using canonical purification, we embed mixed states into a doubled (2+1)-dimensional topological order and employ the slab construction to study (1+1)-dimensional mixed-state phases through condensable algebras in the doubled SymTFT. Hermiticity and positivity of the density matrix impose additional constraints on allowable anyon condensations, enabling a systematic classification of mixed-state phases - including strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases. We present examples of mixed-state phase transitions involving SWSSB and show how gauging within the open SymTFT framework reveals connections among different mixed-state phases.</description>

Abstract: In this dissertation, parallel spinors on oriented and spin Lorentzian four-manifolds are investigated using the theory of spinorial polyforms. The main applications are directed towards the study of torsion parallel spinors and the globally hyperbolic solutions of the four-dimensional supersymmetric NS-NS system. This differential system, which originates in supergravity, involves torsion parallel spinors subject to a curvature condition and provides a natural gauge-theoretic interpretation of skew-symmetric torsion as the curvature of a curving on an abelian bundle gerbe, a natural categorification of the notion of principal circle bundle.</description>

      <title>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</description>

      <title>3d SUSY enhancement and non-semisimple TQFTs from four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that the celebrated SCFT$_4$/VOA$_2$ correspondence can be bridged via three-dimensional field theories arising from a specific R-symmetry twisted circle reduction. We apply this twisted reduction to the $(A_1,A_{n})$ and $(A_1,D_{n})$ families of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas SCFTs using their $\mathcal{N}=1$ Agarwal-Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangians. From $(A_1,A_{2n})$ we derive the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with SUSY enhancement to $\mathcal{N}=4$ in the infrared, generalizing a recent derivation made in the special cases $n=1,2$. Topological twists of these theories are known to yield $semisimple$ TQFTs supporting $rational$ VOAs on holomorphic boundaries. From $(A_1,A_{2n-1})$, $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$, and $(A_1,D_{2n})$, we obtain three new infinite families of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian gauge theories, all with monopole superpotentials, flowing to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs without Coulomb branch, but with the same non-trivial Higgs branch as the four-dimensional parent. Their topological A-twist yields $non$-$semisimple$ TQFTs related to $logarithmic$ VOAs such as $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}}(2)_{-4/3}$.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact simple gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on ``link complements'', i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three dimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-extended Kac-Moody algebras contain so-called gradient structures - a gl(d)-covariant level decomposition of the algebra contains strings of modules at different levels that can be interpreted as spatial gradients. We present an algebraic origin for this phenomenon, based on the recently introduced Lie algebra extension of an over-extended Kac-Moody algebra by its fundamental module, appearing in tensor hierarchy algebra super-extensions of over-extended Kac-Moody algebras. The extensions are described in terms of Lie algebra cohomology, vanishing for finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, but non-vanishing in relevant infinite-dimensional cases. The extension is described in a few different gradings, where it is given a covariant description with respect to different subalgebras. We expect the results to be important for the connection between extended geometry and cosmological billiards.</description>

      <title>On the geometric origin of the energy-momentum tensor improvement terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a flat background, the canonical energy momentum tensor of Lorentz and conformally invariant matter field theories can be improved to a symmetric and traceless tensor that gives the same conserved charges. We argue that the geometric origin of this improvement process is unveiled when the matter theory is coupled to Metric-Affine Gravity. In particular, we show that the Belinfante-Rosenfeld improvement terms correspond to the matter theory's hypermomentum. The improvement terms in conformally invariant matter theories are also related to the hypermomentum however a general proof would require an extended investigation. We demonstrate our results through various examples, such as the free massless scalar, the Maxwell field, Abelian $p$-forms, the Dirac field and a non-unitary massless scalar field. Possible applications of our method for theories that break Lorentz or special conformal invariance are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-point open string and closed string amplitudes at tree level and show that, in a 't Hooft-like limit, they take a form structurally analogous to boundary-to-boundary transition amplitudes of a scalar field in Euclidean AdS space. Interestingly, while both amplitudes yield equivalent expressions, the associated 't Hooft couplings are defined by different worldsheet curvatures-geodesic for the disk and Gaussian for the sphere-suggesting a possible geometric aspect of open/closed string duality.</description>

Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model that shows the linear dependence of the entropy density on the temperature. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below and thus to raise many questions regarding the definition of the gravitational path integral. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. However, we show here that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation: compact slices without boundary, asymptotically flat, or asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter slices. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields and 3D Flat Space Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat Space Cosmologies (FSC) are time-dependent solutions in Einstein gravity in three-dimensional (3D) spacetimes with zero cosmological constant. These are orbifolds of 3D flat space that have a cosmological horizon and can be thought of as analogs of the Banados-Tietelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes of AdS$_3$. We study scalar perturbations about these FSC solutions and explore the spectrum of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) crucially treating the cosmological horizon as a hard wall and extending to complex momenta. We connect this intrinsic analysis with the flatspace limit of the corresponding analysis in the BTZ black hole. The FSC QNMs are then utilized to build the scalar one-loop partition function by methods pioneered by Denef, Hartnoll and Sachdev in various simplifying limits and compared with existing answers in the literature.</description>

      <title>Higher symmetries in twisted eleven-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supersymmetric theories, protected quantities can be reorganized into holomorphic-topological theories by twisting. Recently, it was observed by \cite{JKY} that residual super-Poincar\'e symmetries in certain twisted theories can receive higher corrections, turning them into $L_\infty$ algebras with non-strict actions on the twisted fields. In this note, we show that the same phenomenon occurs for the two admissible twists of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Along the way, we discuss in detail the connection between components of physical and twisted fields.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{W}$-algebra bootstrap of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $\mathfrak{g}$ have protected subsectors that were conjectured in arxiv:1404.1079 to be captured by $\mathcal{W}_\mathfrak{g}$ algebras. We write down the crossing equations for mixed four-point functions $\langle S_{k_1} S_{k_2}S_{k_3}S_{k_4}\rangle$ of 1/2-BPS operators $S_{k_i}$ in 6d (2,0) theories and detail how a certain twist reduces this system to a 2d meromorphic CFT multi-correlator bootstrap problem. We identify the relevant 6d (2,0) $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{g} = \{A_{N-1},D_N\}$ as truncations of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ and solve OPE associativity conditions for their structure constants, both using $\texttt{OPEdefs}$ and the holomorphic bootstrap of arxiv:1503.07111. With this, we solve the multi-correlator bootstrap for twisted 6d four-point correlators $\mathcal{F}_{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$ involving all $S_{k_i}$ up to $\{k_i\}=4$ and extract closed-form expressions for 6d OPE coefficients. We describe the implications of our CFT data on conformal Regge trajectories of the (2,0) theories and finally, demonstrate the consistency of our results with protected higher-derivative corrections to graviton scattering in M-theory on $AdS_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_\mathfrak{o}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the mathematical development of the open/closed correspondence proposed by Mayr and Lerche-Mayr. Given an open geometry on a toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold $\mathcal{X}$ relative to a framed Aganagic-Vafa outer brane $(\mathcal{L},f)$, we construct a toric Calabi-Yau 4-orbifold $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}$ and identify its genus-zero Gromov-Witten invariants with the disk invariants of $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L},f)$, generalizing prior work of the authors in the smooth case. We then upgrade the correspondence to the level of generating functions, and prove that the disk function of $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L},f)$ can be recovered from the equivariant $J$-function of $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}$. We further establish a B-model correspondence that retrieves the B-model disk function of $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L},f)$ from the equivariant $I$-function of $\widetilde{\mathcal{X}}$, and show that the correspondences are compatible with mirror symmetry in both the open and closed sectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating in Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for a minimal coupling, a reheating temperature $T_\text{reh}\sim 10^{8}$~GeV is obtained, with a reheating duration of approximately 21 $e$-folds. We also show that non perturbative gravitational production during preheating can lead to maximum temperatures of the order of $10^{12}$ GeV. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other \emph{ad hoc} inflaton interactions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study their analogues for systems composed of Majorana fermions. In this case, a crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system with fundamentally fermionic degrees of freedom. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving Majorana Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\F$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group when acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on the same sector.</description>

      <title>Coadjoint-orbit bosonization of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</description>

      <title>Speeding up the Universe with a generalised axion-like potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the original charged BTZ black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) proposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinning BTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a `static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations are satisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, the Maxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of the corresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin have proposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analytic rotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that the original charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of the Deshpande--Lunin theory. Moreover, as we shall explicitly illustrate on an example of regularized conformal electrodynamics, similar construction also works for any non-linear electrodynamics in 3-dimensions. At the same time, all these spacetimes represent self-gravitating solutions of (NLE generalized) force-free electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum parameter-mass induced scalarization of qOS-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action.
  We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole.
  It is turned out that two Davies points of heat capacity are identified with two critical onset mass and quantum parameter for spontaneous scalarization.
  However, we do not obtain such connections from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics action.
  Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of qOS-black hole is performed to distinguish quantum parameter from mass by comparing them with the EHT observation.
  There is no constraints on the quantum parameter, but new constraints are found for the mass.
  This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalarization.</description>

      <title>Axial quasi-normal modes of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity to second-order in spin and coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, including corrections up to second order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter $\chi = J/M^2$ and second order in the dCS coupling parameter ($\alpha$). Due to the complexities of constructing a Newman-Penrose tetrad at this order, we employ a metric perturbation approach. We derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the primary axial $l$-mode and the polar $l\pm 1$ modes, which is then solved numerically with appropriate ingoing and outgoing wave boundary conditions. Our numerical framework is validated in the General Relativistic limit against known Schwarzschild QNMs and highly accurate Kerr QNM results for $\chi \leq 0.15$. For the fundamental $n=0, l=m=2$ axial mode, we present detailed numerical results illustrating the dependence of QNM frequencies on both $\chi$ and $\alpha$. We observe that while rotation generally increases the damping time, increasing the dCS coupling parameter significantly reduces the damping time of the axial mode. This finding contrasts with previous analytical work on polar modes, which suggested an increase in damping time due to dCS effects, highlighting a crucial parity-dependent difference in how dCS gravity impacts black hole ringdowns. Furthermore, we provide an analytical fitting formula for this mode. These results, incorporating coupled spin and dCS effects at second order, provide more accurate theoretical predictions for testing dCS gravity with gravitational wave observations of black hole ringdowns. The refined QNM calculations are particularly relevant for lower-mass black hole merger events, such as GW230529, where dCS corrections may be more prominent and their distinct damping signatures could be observable.

      <title>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>
