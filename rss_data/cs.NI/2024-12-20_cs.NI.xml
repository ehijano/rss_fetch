      <title>Revolutionizing QoE-Driven Network Management with Digital Agent Technology in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a digital agent (DA)-assisted network management framework for future sixth generation (6G) networks considering users' quality of experience (QoE). Particularly, a novel QoE metric is defined by incorporating the impact of user behavior dynamics and environment complexity on quality of service (QoS). A two-level DA architecture is developed to assist the QoE-driven network orchestration and slicing, respectively. To further improve the performance of proposed framework, three potential solutions are presented from the perspectives of DA data collection, network scheduling algorithm selection, and DA deployment. A case study demonstrates that the proposed framework can effectively improve users' QoE compared with benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>The GAIUS Experience: Powering a Hyperlocal Mobile Web for Communities in Emerging Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite increasing mobile Internet penetration in developing regions, mobile users continue to experience a poor web experience due to two key factors: (i) lack of locally relevant content; (ii) poor web performance due to complex web pages and poor network conditions. In this paper, we describe our design, implementation and deployment experiences of GAIUS, a mobile content ecosystem that enables efficient creation and dissemination of locally relevant web content into hyperlocal communities in emerging markets. The basic building blocks of GAIUS are a lightweight content edge platform combined with a mobile application that collectively provide a Hyperlocal Web abstraction for mobile users to create and consume locally relevant content and interact with other users via a community abstraction. The GAIUS platform uses MAML, a web specification language that dramatically simplifies web pages to reduce the complexity of Web content within the GAIUS ecosystem, improve page load times and reduce network costs. In this paper, we describe our experiences deploying GAIUS across a large user base in India, Bangladesh and Kenya.</description>

      <title>Overview of AI and Communication for 6G Network: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that could drive the evolution and refinement of AI and communication for 6G, positioning them as a cornerstone of next-generation communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>6GENABLERS-DLT: DLT-based Marketplace for Decentralized Trading of 6G Telco resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6GENABLERS-DLT project addresses critical challenges in fostering multi-party collaboration within dynamic 6G environments. As operators and service providers increasingly depend on third-party resources to meet their contractual and operational needs, the project introduces an innovative, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-anchored Marketplace designed to streamline decentralized telco resource trading. This 6GENABLERS Marketplace serves as a collaborative platform where operators, resource providers, and service providers can seamlessly discover, advertise, and trade telco assets within a transparent, secure, and efficient permissioned environment. Distinguished from public DLT-Blockchain solutions, the Marketplace's permissioned nature ensures robust governance, privacy, and control, making it particularly suited to enterprise and consortium-based use cases in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. The adoption of a decentralized architecture eliminates reliance on a central operator, thereby mitigating risks associated with single points of failure and enhancing system trustworthiness, resilience, and fault tolerance. The Marketplace encompasses a wide range of resources integral to 6G networks, including virtualized mobile core components, Radio Access Network (RAN) assets, edge and cloud infrastructure, and vertical applications tailored to specific industry needs. This diversity enables stakeholders to dynamically access and scale resources, fostering operational efficiency and innovation across 6G ecosystems. Through the 6GENABLERS-DLT project, the vision of a collaborative, resource-rich 6G environment becomes a reality, laying the foundation for a next-generation telco ecosystem where decentralization empowers stakeholders to meet the demands of an interconnected, flexible, and scalable future.</description>

      <title>Cruise Control: Dynamic Model Selection for ML-Based Network Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern networks increasingly rely on machine learning models for real-time insights, including traffic classification, application quality of experience inference, and intrusion detection. However, existing approaches prioritize prediction accuracy without considering deployment constraints or the dynamism of network traffic, leading to potentially suboptimal performance. Because of this, deploying ML models in real-world networks with tight performance constraints remains an open challenge. In contrast with existing work that aims to select an optimal candidate model for each task based on offline information, we propose an online, system-driven approach to dynamically select the best ML model for network traffic analysis. To this end, we present Cruise Control, a system that pre-trains several models for a given task with different accuracy-cost tradeoffs and selects the most appropriate model based on lightweight signals representing the system's current traffic processing ability. Experimental results using two real-world traffic analysis tasks demonstrate Cruise Control's effectiveness in adapting to changing network conditions. Our evaluation shows that Cruise Control improves median accuracy by 2.78% while reducing packet loss by a factor of four compared to offline-selected models.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Channel Access in WLANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX is shown to be robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios, and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of a Physical Internet-based Intermodal Logistic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Physical Internet (PI) paradigm, which has gained attention in research and academia in recent years, leverages advanced logistics and interconnected networks to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, thereby enhancing efficiency, reducing costs and delays, and minimizing environmental impact. Within this system, PI-hubs function similarly to cross-docks enabling the splitting of PI-containers into smaller modules to be delivered through a network of interconnected hubs, allowing dynamic routing optimization and efficient consolidation of PI-containers. Nevertheless, the impact of the system parameters and of the relevant uncertainties on the performance of this innovative logistics framework is still unclear. For this reason, this work proposes a robustness analysis to understand how the PI logistic framework is affected by how PI-containers are handled, consolidated, and processed at the PI-hubs. To this end, the considered PI logistic system is represented via a mathematical programming model that determines the best allocation of PI-containers in an intermodal setting with different transportation modes. In doing so, four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are separately considered to investigate different aspects of the PI system's performance and the relevant robustness is assessed with respect to the PI-hubs' processing times and the number of modules per PI-container. In particular, a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is considered to evaluate, by means of a case study, the individual relevance of each input parameter on the resulting performance.</description>

      <title>LoLaFL: Low-Latency Federated Learning via Forward-only Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for enabling edge learning with distributed data while ensuring data privacy. However, the traditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly meet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model parameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required for convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To address this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding rate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant white-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency Federated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables layer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication rounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two \emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on the proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be harmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures of the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of features to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison with traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can achieve reductions in latency of over 91\% and 98\%, respectively, while maintaining comparable accuracies.</description>

      <title>Space-time Peer-to-Peer Distribution of Multi-party Entanglement for Any Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled states, of which bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network can be essential for further large-scale quantum networks. We propose a novel quantum network protocol called P2PGSD inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to efficiently implement the general graph state distribution in the network layer, which demonstrates advantages in resource efficiency and scalability over existing methods for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for a general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. In addition, we proposed the spacetime network inspired by the symmetry from relativity for memory management in network problems and used it to improve our proposed algorithm. The advantages of our protocols are confirmed by numerical simulations showing an improvement of up to 50\% for general sparse graph states, paving the way for a resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution across any network topology.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, achieving up to +0.29 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement at block error rate (BLER) = 0.35 in non-rainy and +0.25 at BLER = 0.2 in rainy conditions, ensuring superior visual quality compared to standard video coding (VC) methods across various conditions.</description>
