      <title>Reflective Empiricism: Bias Reflection and Introspection as a Scientific Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Reflective Empiricism, an extension of empirical science that incorporates subjective perception and consciousness processes as equally valid sources of knowledge. It views reality as an interplay of subjective experience and objective laws, comprehensible only through systematic introspection, bias reflection, and premise-based logical-explorative modeling. This approach overcomes paradigmatic blindness arising from unreflected subjective filters in established paradigms, promoting an adaptable science. Innovations include a method for bias recognition, premise-based models grounded in observed phenomena to unlock new conceptual spaces, and Heureka moments - intuitive insights - as starting points for hypotheses, subsequently tested empirically. The author's self-observation, such as analyzing belief formation, demonstrates its application and transformative power. Rooted in philosophical and scientific-historical references (e.g., Archimedes' intuition, quantum observer effect), Reflective Empiricism connects physics, psychology, and philosophy, enhancing interdisciplinary synthesis and accelerating knowledge creation by leveraging anomalies and subjective depth. It does not seek to replace empirical research but to enrich it, enabling a more holistic understanding of complex phenomena like consciousness and advancing 21st-century science.</description>

      <title>Modeling Coupled Epidemic-Information Dynamics via Reaction-Diffusion Processes on Multiplex Networks with Media and Mobility Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most existing epidemic models focus on the influence of isolated factors, infectious disease transmission is inherently shaped by the complex interplay of multiple interacting elements. To better capture real-world dynamics, it is essential to develop epidemic models that incorporate diverse, realistic factors. In this study, we propose a coupled disease-information spreading model on multiplex networks that simultaneously accounts for three critical dimensions: media influence, higher-order interactions, and population mobility. This integrated framework enables a systematic analysis of synergistic spreading mechanisms under practical constraints and facilitates the exploration of effective epidemic containment strategies. We employ a microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) to derive the coupled dynamical equations and identify epidemic thresholds, which are then validated through extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Our results show that both mass media dissemination and higher-order network structures contribute to suppressing disease transmission by enhancing public awareness. However, the containment effect of higher-order interactions weakens as the order of simplices increases. We also explore the influence of subpopulation characteristics, revealing that increasing inter-subpopulation connectivity in a connected metapopulation network leads to lower disease prevalence. Furthermore, guiding individuals to migrate toward less accessible or more isolated subpopulations is shown to effectively mitigate epidemic spread. These findings offer valuable insights for designing targeted and adaptive intervention strategies in complex epidemic settings.</description>

      <title>An ILP formulation to optimize flood evacuation paths by minimizing pedestrian speed, length and effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document presents an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach to optimize pedestrian evacuation in flood-prone historic urban areas. The model aims to minimize total evacuation cost by integrating pedestrian speed, route length, and effort, while also selecting the optimal number and position of shelters. A modified minimum cost flow formulation is used to capture complex hydrodynamic and behavioral conditions within a directed street network. The evacuation problem is modeled through an extended graph representing the urban street network, where nodes and links simulate paths and shelters, including incomplete evacuations (deadly nodes), enabling accurate representation of real-world constraints and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI Observatory for the Nuclear Sector: A tool for anticipatory governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI models are rapidly becoming embedded in all aspects of nuclear energy research and work but the safety, security, and safeguards consequences of this embedding are not well understood. In this paper, we call for the creation of an anticipatory system of governance for AI in the nuclear sector as well as the creation of a global AI observatory as a means for operationalizing anticipatory governance. The paper explores the contours of the nuclear AI observatory and an anticipatory system of governance by drawing on work in science and technology studies, public policy, and foresight studies.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Information Disorder: Modeling Mechanisms and Implications Based on a Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic literature review seeks to explain the mechanisms and implications of information disorder for public policy and the democratic process, by proposing a five-stage framework capturing its full life cycle. To our knowledge, no prior reviews in the field of public administration have offered a comprehensive, integrated model of information disorder; most existing studies are situated within communication, information science, or data science, and tend to focus on isolated aspects of the phenomenon. By connecting concepts and stages with enabling factors, agents, tactics and impacts, we reframe information disorder not as a question of "truthiness", individual cognition, digital literacy, or merely of technology, but as a socio-material phenomenon, deeply embedded in and shaped by the material conditions of contemporary digital society. This approach calls for a shift away from fragmented interventions toward more holistic, system-level policy responses.</description>

      <title>Systemic risk mitigation in supply chains through network rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The networked nature of supply chains makes them susceptible to systemic risk, where local firm failures can propagate through firm interdependencies that can lead to cascading supply chain disruptions. The systemic risk of supply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and dynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties contribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can be significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry unnecessarily high levels of systemic risk. We discuss the possibility of devising policies to reduce systemic risk through minimal, targeted interventions in supply chain networks through market-based incentives.</description>

      <title>Governance as a complex, networked, democratic, satisfiability problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions, solving societal challenges while respecting the will of the people. New governance frameworks represent this as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? We model the decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This framework allows to consider different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where small overlapping decision groups make specific decisions and share information. Effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. Beyond simulations, our conceptual framework can explore a wide range of governance strategies and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>
