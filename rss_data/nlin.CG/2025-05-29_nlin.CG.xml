      <title>Loop Patterns Formed by Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cellular Automata (CA) rule is presented that can generate "loop patterns" in a 2D grid under fixed boundary conditions. A loop is a cyclically closed path represented by one-cells enclosed by zero-cells. A loop pattern can contain several loops that are not allowed to touch each other. The problem is solved by designing an appropriate set of tiles that can overlap and which are used in the CA rule. Templates are derived from the tiles which are used for local pattern matching. In order to drive the evolution to the desired patterns, noise is injected if the templates do not match or other constraints are not fulfilled. The general CA rule can be specialized by enabling certain conditions, and the characteristics of five rule variants are explained. Simulations illustrate that the CA rule can securely evolve stable loop patterns. The preliminary theoretical analysis of the obtained loop patterns raises many interesting research problems for the future -- several of them have been briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Tuning of Interface Physics in Multiphase Lattice Boltzmann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning the interface properties of multiphase models is of paramount importance to the final goal of achieving a one-to-one matching with nucleation and cavitation experiments. The surface tension, at the leading order, and the Tolman length, at higher order, play a crucial role in the estimation of the free-energy barrier determining the experimentally observed nucleation rates. The lattice Boltzmann method allows for a computationally efficient modelling approach of multiphase flows, however, tuning results are concerned with the surface tension and neglect the Tolman length. We present a novel perspective that leverages all the degrees of freedom hidden in the forcing stencil of the Shan-Chen multiphase model. By means of the lattice pressure tensor we determine and tune the coefficients of higher-order derivative terms related to surface tension and Tolman length at constant interface width and density ratio. We test the method by means of both hydrostatic and dynamic simulations and demonstrate the dependence of homogeneous nucleation rates on the value of the Tolman length. This work provides a new tool that can be integrated with previously existing strategies thus marking a step forwards to a high-fidelity modelling of phase-changing fluid dynamics.</description>
