      <title>A finite-time quantum Otto engine with tunnel coupled one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a theoretical study of a finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle driven by inter-particle interactions in a weakly interacting one-dimensional Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime. Utilizing a $c$-field approach, we simulate the entire Otto cycle, i.e. the two work strokes and the two equilibration strokes. More specifically, the interaction-induced work strokes are modelled by treating the working fluid as an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution. The equilibration strokes, on the other hand, are modelled by treating the working fluid as an open quantum system tunnel-coupled to another quasicondensate which acts as either the hot or cold reservoir, albeit of finite size. We find that, unlike a uniform 1D Bose gas, a harmonically trapped quasicondensate cannot operate purely as a \emph{heat} engine; instead, the engine operation is enabled by additional \emph{chemical} work performed on the working fluid, facilitated by the inflow of particles from the hot reservoir. The microscopic treatment of dynamics during equilibration strokes enables us to evaluate the characteristic operational time scales of this Otto chemical engine, crucial for characterizing its power output, without any \emph{ad hoc} assumptions about typical thermalization timescales. We analyse the performance and quantify the figures of merit of the proposed Otto chemical engine, finding that it offers a favourable trade-off between efficiency and power output, particularly when the interaction-induced work strokes are implemented via a sudden quench. We further demonstrate that in the sudden quench regime, the engine operates with an efficiency close to the near-adiabatic (near maximum efficiency) limit, while concurrently achieving maximum power output.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Directed Percolation on a Dynamic Network using Rydberg Facilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The facilitation of Rydberg excitations in a gas of atoms provides an ideal model system to study epidemic evolution on (dynamic) networks and self organization of complex systems to the critical point of a non-equilibrium phase transition. Using Monte-Carlo simulations and a machine learning algorithm we show that the universality class of this phase transition can be tuned. The classes include directed percolation (DP), the most common class in short-range spreading models, and mean-field (MF) behavior, but also different types of anomalous directed percolation (ADP), characterized by rare long-range excitation processes. In a frozen gas, ground state atoms that can facilitate each other form a static network, for which we predict DP universality. Atomic motion then turns the network into a dynamic one with long-range (Levy-flight type) excitations. This leads to continuously varying critical exponents corresponding to the ADP universality class, eventually reaching MF behavior. These findings also explain the recently observed critical exponent of Rydberg facilitation in an ultra-cold gas experiment [Helmrich et al., Nature 577, 481 (2020)], which was in between DP and MF values.</description>

      <title>An efficient method to generate near-ideal hollow beams of different shapes for box potential of quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold quantum gases are usually prepared in conservative traps for quantum simulation experiments. The atomic density inhomogeneity, together with the consequent position-dependent energy and time scales of cold atoms in traditional harmonic traps, makes it difficult to manipulate and detect the sample at a better level. These problems are partially solved by optical box traps of blue-detuned hollow beams. However, generating a high-quality hollow beam with high light efficiency for the box trap is challenging. Here, we present a scheme that combines the fixed optics, including axicons and prisms, to pre-shape a Gaussian beam into a hollow beam, with a digital micromirror device (DMD) to improve the quality of the hollow beam further, providing a nearly ideal optical potential of various shapes for preparing highly homogeneous cold atoms. The highest power-law exponent of potential walls can reach a value over 100, and the light efficiency from a Gaussian to a hollow beam is also improved compared to direct optical shaping by a mask or a DMD. Combined with a one-dimensional optical lattice, a nearly ideal two-dimensional uniform quantum gas with different geometrical boundaries can be prepared for exploring quantum many-body physics to an unprecedented level.</description>

      <title>Conductivity of lattice bosons at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulations are quickly becoming an indispensable tool for studying particle transport in correlated lattice models. One of the central topics in the study of transport is the bad-metal behavior, characterized by the direct current (dc) resistivity linear in temperature. In the fermionic Hubbard model, optical conductivity has been studied extensively, and a recent optical lattice experiment has demonstrated bad metal behavior in qualitative agreement with theory. Far less is known about transport in the bosonic Hubbard model. We investigate the conductivity in the Bose-Hubbard model, and focus on the regime of strong interactions and high-temperatures. We use numerically exact calculations for small lattice sizes. At weak tunneling, we find multiple peaks in the optical conductivity that stem from the Hubbard bands present in the many-body spectrum. This feature slowly washes out as the tunneling rate gets stronger. At high temperature, we identify a regime of $T$-linear resistivity, as expected. When the interactions are very strong, the leading inverse-temperature coefficient in conductivity is proportional to the tunneling amplitude. As the tunneling becomes stronger, this dependence takes quadratic form. At very strong coupling and half filling, we identify a separate linear resistivity regime at lower temperature, corresponding to the hard-core boson regime. Additionally, we unexpectedly observe that at half filling, in a big part of the phase diagram, conductivity is an increasing function of the coupling constant before it saturates at the hard-core-boson result. We explain this feature based on the analysis of the many-body energy spectrum and the contributions to conductivity of individual eigenstates of the system.</description>

      <title>Optical Phase Aberration Correction with an Ultracold Quantum Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical aberration correction technique for ultracold quantum gas experiments which directly utilizes the quantum gas as a wavefront sensor. The direct use of the quantum gas enables correcting aberrations that are otherwise impractical to measure, e.g. introduced by vacuum windows. We report a root-mean-square precision and accuracy of 0.01{\lambda} and 0.03{\lambda}, respectively, and also show independently the reduction of aberrations through measurement of the trap frequency of our optical tweezer. These improvements were achieved for a tweezer size that is well below our imaging resolution. The present work is in particular intended to serve as a tutorial for experimentalists interested in implementing similar methods in their experiment.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell inequalities in an analogue black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signals of entanglement and nonlocality are quantitatively evaluated at zero and finite temperature in an analogue black hole realized in the flow of a quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The violation of Lorentz invariance inherent to this analog system opens the prospect to observe 3-mode quantum correlations and we study the corresponding violation of bipartite and tripartite Bell inequalities. It is shown that the long wavelength modes of the system are maximally entangled, in the sense that they realize a superposition of continuous variable versions of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states whose entanglement resists partial tracing.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Stark Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems. However, studies on NHSE in systems without translational symmetry remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed "imaginary Stark skin effect" (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. The energy spectrum of this model exhibits a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. These skin modes exhibit peculiar behaviors, expressed as a single stable exponential decay wave within the bulk region. We use the transfer matrix method to analyze the formation of the ISSE in this model. According to the eigen-decomposition of the transfer matrix, the wave function is divided into two parts, one of which dominates the behavior of the skin modes in the bulk. Our findings provide insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contribute to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems in general.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of non-ground-state caesium atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms serve as low-entropy sources for a multitude of quantum-science applications, ranging from quantum simulation and quantum many-body physics to proof-of-principle experiments in quantum metrology and quantum computing. For stability reasons, in the majority of cases the energetically lowest-lying atomic spin state is used. Here we report the Bose-Einstein condensation of caesium atoms in the Zeeman-excited mf = 2 state, realizing a non-ground-state Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable interactions and tunable loss. We identify two regions of magnetic field in which the two-body relaxation rate is low enough that condensation is possible. We characterize the phase transition and quantify the loss processes, finding unusually high three-body losses in one of the two regions. Our results open up new possibilities for the mixing of quantum-degenerate gases, for polaron and impurity physics, and in particular for the study of impurity transport in strongly correlated one-dimensional quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <title>Matter-wave collimation to picokelvin energies with scattering length and potential shape control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of atom interferometers depends on their ability to realize long pulse separation times and prevent loss of contrast by limiting the expansion of the atomic ensemble within the interferometer beam through matter-wave collimation. Here we investigate the impact of atomic interactions on collimation by applying a lensing protocol to a $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensate at different scattering lengths. Tailoring interactions, we measure energies corresponding to $340 \pm 12$ pK in one direction. Our results are supported by an accurate simulation, which allows us to extrapolate a 2D ballistic expansion energy of $438 \pm 77$ pK. Based on our findings we propose an advanced scenario, which enables 3D expansion energies below $16$ pK by implementing an additional pulsed delta-kick. Our results pave the way to realize ensembles with more than $1\times10^5$ atoms and 3D energies in the two-digit pK range in typical dipole trap setups without the need for micro-gravity or long baseline environments.</description>
