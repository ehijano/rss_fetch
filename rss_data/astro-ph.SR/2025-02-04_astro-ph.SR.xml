      <title>Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution are fast (dynamical-timescale) interactions in binary stars that drastically alter their evolution. They are key to understanding a plethora of astrophysical phenomena. Stellar mergers are thought to produce blue straggler stars, blue supergiants, and stars with peculiar rotation and surface chemical abundances. Common-envelope evolution is proposed as a key stage in the formation of gravitational wave sources, X-ray binaries, type Ia supernovae, cataclysmic variables, and other systems. A significant fraction (tens of percent) of binary stars undergo such a phase during their evolution. In this chapter, we first discuss processes leading to a stellar merger or common-envelope phase. We then explain these complex interactions, starting from underlying physical principles like entropy sorting in stellar mergers and the energy formalism in common envelopes. This is followed by a more complete picture revealed by three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations. The outcomes of these interactions are discussed comprehensively and special emphasis is given to the role of magnetic fields. Both stellar mergers and common-envelope evolution remain far from fully understood, and we conclude by highlighting open questions in their study.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of a Coronal Mass Ejection Observed During the Near-radial Alignment of Solar Orbiter and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) are the primary sources of geomagnetic storms at Earth. Negative out-of-ecliptic component (Bz) of magnetic field in the ICME or its associated sheath region is necessary for it to be geo-effective. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs containing data-constrained flux ropes are more suitable for forecasting their geo-effectiveness as compared to hydrodynamic models of the CME. ICMEs observed in situ by radially aligned spacecraft can provide an important setup to validate the physics-based heliospheric modeling of CMEs. In this work, we use the constant-turn flux rope (CTFR) model to study an ICME that was observed in situ by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and at Earth, when they were in a near-radial alignment. This was a stealth CME that erupted on 2020 April 14 and reached Earth on 2020 April 20 with a weak shock and a smoothly rotating magnetic field signature. We found that the CTFR model was able to reproduce the rotating magnetic field signature at both SolO and Earth with very good accuracy. The simulated ICME arrived 5 hours late at SolO and 5 hours ahead at Earth, when compared to the observed ICME. We compare the propagation of the CME front through the inner heliosphere using synthetic J-maps and those observed in the heliospheric imager data and discuss the role of incorrect ambient SW background on kinematics of the simulated CME. This study supports the choice of the CTFR model for reproducing the magnetic field of ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Using Polar Faculae to Determine the Sun's High-Latitude Rotation Rate. II: Simulations and New Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, I described a new way of determining the high-latitude solar rotation rate statistically from space-time maps of polar faculae observed in the 6767 \r{A} continuum by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Sheeley (2024). Now, I have tested the technique by applying it to simulated images whose faculae have known speeds, and I have been able to recover those speeds with an accuracy better than 0.01 km s$^{-1}$. Repeated measurements of the Sun's polar faculae gave the same high-latitude profile as before, but with a slightly faster synodic rotation rate of 9.$^{\circ}$10 day$^{-1}$ and a rotation period of 39.6 days. Applying this space-time tracking procedure to magnetic flux elements observed with the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), I obtained a similar rotation profile with a speed of 9.$^{\circ}$55 day$^{-1}$ and a synodic rotation period of 37.7 days. These rates are comparable to polar rotation rates, obtained by other techniques, but the new latitude profiles are noticeably flatter than the quartic fits to those prior measurements.</description>

      <title>An embedded Disk (eDisk) in the IceAge: Investigating the jet and outflow from CED 110 IRS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures ($\sim$1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 $\mu$m and [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of $\leq$ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} $\pm$ 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H$_2$ outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H$_2$ emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 $\pm$ 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {$\pm$ 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.</description>

      <title>Sun-as-a-star analysis of simulated solar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Stellar flares have an impact on habitable planets. To relate the observations of the Sun with those of stars, one needs to use a Sun-as-a-star analysis, that is, to degrade the resolution of the Sun to a single point. With the data of the Sun-as-a-star observations, a simulation of solar flares is required to provide a systemic clue for the Sun-as-a-star study.
  Aims: We aim to explore how the Sun-as-a-star spectrum varies with the flare magnitude and location based on a grid of solar flare models.
  Methods: Using 1D radiative hydrodynamics modeling and multi-thread flare assumption, we obtained the spectrum of a typical flare with an enhancement of chromospheric lines.
  Result: The Sun-as-a-star spectrum of the H$\alpha$ line shows enhanced and shifted components, which are highly dependent on the flare magnitude and location. The equivalent width $\Delta\mathrm{EW}$ is a good indicator of energy release. The bisector method can be used to diagnose the sign of the line-of-sight velocity in the flaring atmosphere. For both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, the Sun-as-a-star spectrum of a limb flare tends to be wider and shows a dip in the line center. In particular, we propose two quantities to diagnose the magnitude and location of the stellar flares. Besides this, caution must be taken when calculating the radiation energy, since the astrophysical flux-to-energy conversion ratio is dependent on the flare location.</description>

      <title>Detection of Ubiquitous Circumbinary Matter in Hot Subdwarfs Formed from Common-Envelope Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of compact binary systems is largely driven by their evolution through a common envelope (CE) phase, crucial for understanding phenomena such as type Ia supernovae and black hole mergers. Despite their importance, direct observational evidence for CE material has been elusive due to the transient nature of these envelopes. Numerical simulations suggest that some envelope material may persist post-ejection. In this study, we investigate circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding hot subdwarf (sdB) stars, focusing on material ejected during the CE phase of binary evolution. We analyze Ca II K absorption lines in 727 sdB candidates from the LAMOST-LRS survey, selecting 145 stars with strong absorption features, indicating the presence of CSM. We compare the velocities of the Ca II K lines with the systemic velocities of sdB binaries, confirming that the material originates from ejected common-envelope material. The results show that the CSM persists long after the CE event, suggesting the formation of a stable, long-lived circumstellar environment around sdB stars. This study enhances our understanding of the role of CSM in post-CE evolution and provides new insights into the physical processes shaping the evolution of sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>K-dwarf Radius Inflation and a 10-Gyr Spin-down Clock Unveiled through Asteroseismology of HD~219134 from the Keck Planet Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first asteroseismic analysis of the K3\,V planet host HD~219134, based on four consecutive nights of radial velocities collected with the Keck Planet Finder. We applied Gold deconvolution to the power spectrum to disentangle modes from sidelobes in the spectral window, and extracted 25 mode frequencies with spherical degrees $0\leq\ell\leq3$. We derive the fundamental properties using five different evolutionary-modeling pipelines and report a mass of 0.763 $\pm$ 0.020 (stat) $\pm$ 0.007 (sys) M$_\odot$, a radius of 0.748 $\pm$ 0.007 (stat) $\pm$ 0.002 (sys) R$_\odot$, and an age of 10.151 $\pm$ 1.520 (stat) $\pm$ 0.810 (sys) Gyr. Compared to the interferometric radius 0.783 $\pm$ 0.005~R$_\odot$, the asteroseismic radius is 4\% smaller at the 4-$\sigma$ level -- a discrepancy not easily explained by known interferometric systematics, modeling assumptions on atmospheric boundary conditions and mixing lengths, magnetic fields, or tidal heating. HD~219134 is the first main-sequence star cooler than 5000~K with an asteroseismic age estimate and will serve as a critical calibration point for stellar spin-down relations. We show that existing calibrated prescriptions for angular momentum loss, incorporating weakened magnetic braking with asteroseismically constrained stellar parameters, accurately reproduce the observed rotation period. Additionally, we revised the masses and radii of the super-Earths in the system, which support their having Earth-like compositions. Finally, we confirm that the oscillation amplitude in radial velocity scales as $(L/M)^{1.5}$ in K dwarfs, in contrast to the $(L/M)^{0.7}$ relation observed in G dwarfs. These findings provide significant insights into the structure and angular momentum loss of K-type stars.</description>

      <title>Revisiting turbulent properties of solar convection with 3D radiative hydrodynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the turbulent structure and dynamics of the upper solar convection zone using a 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulation model at 45 degrees latitude. The model reveals the self-formation of meridional flows, the leptocline, and the radial differential rotation. Unlike previous studies, the model shows a complex variation of the characteristic scales of turbulent flows with depth. In particular, an increase in the characteristic convective scale is trackable within an individual snapshot up to a depth of 7 Mm, near the bottom of the hydrogen ionization zone, where turbulent flows become weaker and more homogeneous. However, the turbulent spectra show an increase in scale with depth and a qualitative change in convective patterns below 7 Mm (near the bottom of the leptocline), suggesting changes in the diffusivity properties and energy exchange among different scales.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycles: Can They Be Predicted?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar magnetic field, thought to be generated by the motion of plasma within the Sun, alternates on the order of 11-year cycles and is incompletely understood. Industries rely on accurate forecasts of solar activity, but can solar cycles be predicted? And how well did predictions perform for the current cycle? The answer is less-than-stellar... Of more than 100 predictions, most underestimated the amplitude (peak sunspot number) of cycle 25, some massively so. Fewer predictions were made for the timing of solar maximum, but timing predictions seem to have performed better than amplitude predictions. Reasons for inaccurate prediction are suggested, and perspectives are given on how future studies might improve upon the extant literature.</description>

      <title>On field line slippage rates in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the solar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale magnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring information across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such as separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General Magnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the reconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field lines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local theory of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about reconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that location. The theory connects the concept of the field line slippage rate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the magnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned current density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar corona, discussed in relation to this new theory, is mathematically equivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic simulations. However, the general application of the theory is adaptable to the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence modelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The theory is illustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes: an analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the latter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if the given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the magnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.</description>

      <title>Testing the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs I.Hydrogen-dominated atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work was to measure the masses and radii of white dwarfs that belong to widely separated, common proper motion binaries with non-degenerate companions. These can be assessed, independently from theoretical mass-radius relations, through measurements of gravitational redshifts and photometric radii. We studied 50 white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, performing a detailed analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 18,500) spectra by means of state-of-the-art grids of synthetic models and specialized software. Hence, we measured accurate radial velocities from the H-alpha and H-beta line-cores, thus obtaining the white dwarf gravitational redshifts. Jointly with a photometric analysis that is formalized by a Bayesian inference method, we measured precise white dwarf radii that allowed us to directly measure the white dwarf masses from their gravitational redshifts. The distributions of measured masses and radii agree within 6% (at the 1-sigma level) from the theoretical mass-radius relation, thus delivering a much smaller scatter in comparison with previous analyses that used gravitational redshift measurements from low-resolution spectra. A comparison against model-dependent spectroscopic estimates produces a larger scatter of 15% on the mass determinations. We find an agreement within ~10% from previous model-based, photometric mass estimates from the literature. Combining gravitational redshift measurements and photometric analysis of white dwarfs delivers precise and accurate, empirical estimates of their masses and radii. This work confirms the reliability of the theoretical mass-radius relation from the lightest to the heaviest white dwarfs in our sample (0.38-1.3 Msun). [abridged]</description>

      <title>Ca II K Polar Network Index of the Sun: A Proxy for Historical Polar Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's polar magnetic field is pivotal in understanding solar dynamo processes and forecasting future solar cycles. However, direct measurements of the polar field is only available since the 1970s. The chromospheric Ca II K polar network index (PNI; the fractional area of the chromospheric network regions above a certain latitude) has recently emerged as a reliable proxy for polar magnetic fields. In this study, we derive PNI estimates from newly calibrated, rotation-corrected Ca II K observations from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (1904-2007) and modern data from the Rome Precision Solar Photometric Telescope (2000-2022). We use both of those Ca II K archives to identify polar network regions with an automatic adaptive threshold segmentation technique and calculate the PNI. The PNI obtained from both the archives shows a significant correlation with the measured polar field from WSO (Pearson correlation coefficient r &gt; 0.93) and the derived polar field based on an Advective Flux Transport Model (r &gt; 0.91). The PNI series also shows a significant correlation with faculae counts derived from Mount Wilson Observatory observations (r &gt; 0.87) for both KoSO and Rome-PSPT data. Finally, we use the PNI series from both archives to reconstruct the polar magnetic field over a 119-year-long period, which includes last 11 solar cycles (Cycle 14-24). We also obtain a relationship between the amplitude of solar cycles (in 13-month smoothed sunspot number) and the strength of the reconstructed polar field at the preceding solar cycle minimum to validate the prediction of the ongoing solar cycle, Cycle 25.</description>

      <title>The effect of thermal misbalance on magnetohydrodynamic modes in coronal magnetic cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dispersion of magnetohydrodynamic waves influenced by thermal misbalance in a cylindrical configuration with a finite axial magnetic field within solar coronal plasmas. Specifically, it examines how thermal misbalance, characterized by two distinct timescales directly linked to the cooling and heating functions, influences the dispersion relation. This investigation is a key approach for understanding non-adiabatic effects on the behaviour of these waves. Our findings reveal that the effect of thermal misbalance on fast sausage and kink modes, consistent with previous studies on slabs, is small but slightly more pronounced than previously thought. The impact is smaller at long-wavelength limits but increases at shorter wavelengths, leading to higher damping rates. This minor effect on fast modes occurs despite the complex interaction of thermal misbalance terms within the dispersion relation, even at low-frequency limits defined by the characteristic timescales. Additionally, a very small amplification is observed, indicating a suppressed damping state for the long-wavelength fundamental fast kink mode. In contrast, slow magnetoacoustic modes are significantly affected by thermal misbalance, with the cusp frequency shifting slightly to lower values, which is significant for smaller longitudinal wavenumbers. This thermal misbalance likely accounts for the substantial attenuation observed in the propagation of slow magnetoacoustic waves within the solar atmosphere. The long-wavelength limit leads to an analytical expression that accurately describes the frequency shifts in slow modes due to misbalance, closely aligning with both numerical and observational results.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of linear momentum in widely used hierarchical methods in gravitational gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) in the PHANTOM code for the calculation of forces in a self-gravitating system. The gravitational interaction forces are divided into short-range and long-range interactions depending on the value of the tree opening parameter of the hierarchical kd-tree. It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for any pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for the entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an unphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a pair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found to be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of Keplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the number of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2. For smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly longer.</description>

      <title>V498 Hya, a new candidate for a period bouncer Cataclysmic Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V498 Hya (SDSS J084555.07+033929.2) was identified as a short-period cataclysmic variable (CV) by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) in 2008. The superhump period was measured during the detected single superoutburst of V498 Hya. The quiescent spectrum subsequently taken by the \SDSSV\ Milky Way Mapper survey suggested that the CV donor may be a brown dwarf. We present time-resolved follow-up spectroscopy of V498 Hya in quiescence, obtained with the GTC OSIRIS spectrograph, from which we derived the 86.053 min spectroscopic period, systemic radial velocity, and the gravitational redshift of the Mg II line. We also modeled the spectral energy distribution to constrain the system parameters, including the &gt; 0.82 Ms mass of the white dwarf and the best-fit value 0.043 +/- 0.004 Ms of the donor star mass. This combination of parameters implies that V498 Hya has evolved past the period minimum and is a relatively rare ``period bouncer''.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>

      <title>Short-Period Small Planets with High Mutual Inclinations are more Common around Metal-Rich Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00442v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a correlation between the stellar metallicities and the mutual inclinations of multi-planet systems hosting short-period small planets (a/Rs&lt;12, Rp&lt;4Re). We analyzed 89 multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, K2, and TESS, where the innermost planets have periods shorter than 10 days. We found that the mutual inclinations of the innermost two planets are higher and more diverse around metal-rich stars. The mutual inclinations are calculated as the absolute differences between the best-fit inclinations of the innermost two planets from transit modeling, which represent the lower limits of the true mutual inclinations. The mean and variance of the mutual inclination distribution of the metal-rich systems are 3.1+-0.5 and 3.1+-0.4 degrees, while for the metal-poor systems they are 1.3+-0.2 and 1.0+-0.2 degrees. This finding suggests that inner planetary systems around metal-rich stars are dynamically hotter. We summarized the theories that could plausibly explain this correlation, including the influence of giant planets, higher solid densities in protoplanetary disks around metal-rich stars, or secular chaos coupled with an excess of angular momentum deficits. Planet formation and population synthesis models tracking the mutual inclination evolution would be essential to fully understand this correlation.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Stellar Chromospheres and Coronae on Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main source of bias in transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres is magnetic activity of the host star in the form of stellar spots, faculae or flares. However, the fact that main-sequence stars have a chromosphere and a corona, and that these optically thin layers are dominated by line emission may alter the global interpretation of the planetary spectrum, has largely been neglected. Using a JWST NIRISS/SOSS data set of hot Jupiter HAT-P-18 b, we show that even at near-IR and IR wavelengths, the presence of these layers leads to significant changes in the transmission spectrum of the planetary atmosphere. Accounting for these stellar outer layers thus improves the atmospheric fit of HAT-P-18 b, and increases its best-fit atmospheric temperature from 536 K to 736 K, a value much closer to the predicted equilibrium temperature of 852 K. Our analysis also decreases the best-fit abundance of CO2 by almost an order of magnitude. The approach provides a new window to the properties of chromospheres/corona in stars other than our Sun.</description>

      <title>Exploring the capability of the HH 80-81 protostellar jet to accelerate relativistic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays.
  Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration.
  Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission.
  Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tide consists of various waves that can resonate with orbital motion. We test this coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion using a simple two-dimensional shallow water model, which can be applied to a rocky planet covered with thin ocean or atmosphere. Then we take the earth-moon system as a fiducial model to calculate the tidal resonances and orbital evolution. We find that tidal dissipation can even increase with increasing orbital separation because of the coupling of dynamical tide and orbital motion. We draw the conclusion that the coupling is not negligible to study the orbital evolution on secular timescale.</description>

      <title>Deriving pulsar pair-production multiplicities from pulsar wind nebulae using H.E.S.S. and LHAASO observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) dominate the galactic gamma-ray sky at very high energies, and are major contributors to the leptonic cosmic ray flux. However, whether or not pulsars also accelerate ions to comparable energies is not yet experimentally confirmed. We aim to constrain the birth period and pair-production multiplicity for a set of pulsars. In doing so, we aim to constrain the proportion of ions in the pulsar magnetosphere and hence the proportion of ions that could enter the pulsar wind. We estimate possible ranges of the value of the average pair production multiplicity for a sample of 26 pulsars in the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalogue, which have also been observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescopes. We then derive lower limits for the pulsar birth periods and average pair production multiplicities for a subset of these sources where the extent of the pulsar wind nebula and surrounding supernova shell have been measured in the radio. We also derive curves for the average pair production multiplicities as a function of birth period for sources recently observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We show that there is a potential for hadrons entering the pulsar wind for most of the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO sources we consider, dependent upon the efficiency of luminosity conversion into particles. We also present estimates of the pulsar birth period for six of these sources, which all fall into the range of $\simeq$10-50 ms.</description>

      <title>The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01372v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that &gt;M4 stars at ages of &lt;10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. The tool is designed to generate simulated stellar spectra, enabling the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator that takes an input stellar spectrum-either observed or synthetic-and produces a simulated observation based on the instrument's performance and characteristics. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal Holes (CHs) are large-scale, low-density regions in the solar atmosphere which may expel high-speed solar wind streams that incite hazardous, geomagnetic storms. Coronal and solar wind models can predict these high-speed streams and the performance of the coronal model can be validated against segmented CH boundaries. We present a novel method named Sub-Transition Region Identification of Ensemble Coronal Holes (STRIDE-CH) to address prominent challenges in segmenting CHs with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imagery. Ground-based, chromospheric He I 10830 {\AA} line imagery and underlying Fe I photospheric magnetograms are revisited to disambiguate CHs from filaments and quiet Sun, overcome obscuration by coronal loops, and complement established methods in the community which use space-borne, coronal EUV observations. Classical computer vision techniques are applied to constrain the radiative and magnetic properties of detected CHs, produce an ensemble of boundaries, and compile these boundaries in a confidence map that quantifies the likelihood of CH presence throughout the solar disk. This method is science-enabling towards future studies of CH formation and variability from a mid-atmospheric perspective.</description>

      <title>Stellar Loci. VIII. Photometric Metallicities for 100 Million Stars Based on Synthetic Gaia Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the stellar locus method to synthetic $(BP-RP)_{XPSP}$ and $(BP-G)_{XPSP}$ colors derived from corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra to obtain precise estimates of metallicity for about 100 million stars in the Milky Way (34 million giants in the color range $0.6 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.75$ and 65 million dwarfs in the color range $0.2 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.5$). The sub milli-magnitude precision of the derived synthetic stellar colors enables estimates of metallicity for stars as low as [Fe/H] $\sim -4$. Multiple validation tests indicate that the typical metallicity precision is between 0.05 -- 0.1 dex for both dwarfs and giants at [Fe/H] = 0 as faint as G $\sim$ 16, and decreases to 0.15 -- 0.25 dex at [Fe/H] = $-$2.0. For $-4.0 &lt; $[Fe/H]$&lt; -3.0$, the typical metallicity precision decreases to on the order of 0.4 -- 0.5 dex, based on the results from the reference sample. Our achieved precision is comparable to or better than previous efforts using the entire XP spectra, and about three times better than our previous work based on Gaia EDR3 colors. This opens up new opportunities for investigations of stellar populations, the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the chemistry of stars and star clusters, and the identification of candidate stars for subsequent high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. The catalog is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12149/101548.</description>

      <title>High-precision broadband linear polarimetry of early-type binaries. V. The Binary System HD 165052 in Open Cluster NGC 6530</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20991</link>

Abstract: This study continues our investigation of early-type binaries using high-precision broad-band polarimetry, focusing on HD 165052, a massive O+O-type binary in the young cluster NGC 6530. Our aim was to monitor linear polarization variations and independently determine the orbital period through polarization data analysis. By examining the phase-locked Stokes parameters, we estimated the orbital inclination at about 55+5/-55 deg, and the orientation at 148+20/-22 deg. The binary's rotation direction is clockwise. Using the Dipol-2 polarimeter with the 60 cm KVA and Tohoku T60 telescopes, we achieved polarization measurement accuracy around 0.01 percent in the B, V, and R passbands. Period analysis identified a strong periodic signal with a cycle of about 1.48 days, corresponding to half of the orbital period of about 2.96 days. The second Fourier harmonics suggest a symmetric scattering geometry, likely due to electron scattering in interacting stellar winds. Our estimates indicate a mass-loss rate of approximately 3.5 x 10^(-7) solar masses per year. Observations of neighboring stars in NGC 6530 revealed complex interstellar polarization behaviors within the cluster, enhancing our understanding of its polarimetric environment.</description>

      <title>Solar Gamma-Ray Evidence for a Distinct Population of $&gt;$ 1 MeV Flare-Accelerated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant improvements in our understanding of nuclear $\gamma$-ray line production and instrument performance allow us to better characterize the continuum emission from electrons at energies $\gtrsim$ 300 keV during solar flares. We represent this emission by the sum of a power-law extension of hard X-rays (PL) and a power law times an exponential function (PLexp). We fit the $\gamma$-ray spectra in 25 large flares observed by SMM, RHESSI, and Fermi with this summed continuum along with calculated spectra of all known nuclear components. The PL, PLexp, and nuclear components are separated spectroscopically. A distinct origin of the PLexp is suggested by significant differences between its time histories and those of the PL and nuclear components. RHESSI imaging/spectroscopy of the 2005 January 20 flare, reveals that the PL and nuclear components come from the footpoints while the PLexp component comes from the corona. While the index and flux of the anisotropic PL component are strongly dependent on the flares' heliocentric angle, the PLexp parameters show no such dependency and are consistent with a component that is isotropic. The PLexp spectrum is flat at low energies and rolls over at a few MeV. Such a shape can be produced by inverse Compton scattering of soft X-rays by 10--20 MeV electrons and by thin-target bremsstrahlung from electrons with a spectrum that peaks between 3 -- 5 MeV, or by a combination of the two processes. These electrons can produce radiation detectable at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a direct progenitor detection for the Type Ic SN 2017ein based on late-time observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($&gt;$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for r-process nucleosynthesis in delayed MeV emission from the SGR 1806-20 magnetar giant flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of heavy elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) has been an enduring mystery for over half a century. Cehula et al. (2024) recently showed that magnetar giant flares, among the brightest transients ever observed, can shock-heat and eject neutron star crustal material at high velocity, achieving the requisite conditions for an $r$-process. Patel et al. (in prep.) confirmed an $r$-process in these ejecta using detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. Radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized nuclei releases a forest of gamma-ray lines, Doppler broadened by the high ejecta velocities $v \gtrsim 0.1c$ into a quasi-continuous spectrum peaking around 1 MeV. Here, we show that the predicted emission properties (light-curve, fluence, and spectrum) match a previously unexplained hard gamma-ray signal seen in the aftermath of the famous December 2004 giant flare from the magnetar SGR 1806-20. This MeV emission component, rising to peak around 10 minutes after the initial spike before decaying away over the next few hours, is direct observational evidence for the synthesis of $\sim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ of $r$-process elements. The discovery of magnetar giant flares as confirmed $r$-process sites, contributing at least $\sim 1$-$10\%$ of the total Galactic abundances, has implications for the Galactic chemical evolution, especially at the earliest epochs probed by low-metallicity stars. It also implicates magnetars as potentially dominant sources of heavy cosmic rays. Characterization of the $r$-process emission from giant flares by resolving decay line features offers a compelling science case for NASA's forthcoming COSI nuclear spectrometer, as well as next-generation MeV telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

      <title>HD 206893 B at High Spectral Resolution with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $&gt;8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $&gt;4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.</description>
