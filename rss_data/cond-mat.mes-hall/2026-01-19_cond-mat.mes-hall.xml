      <title>Lambert W Function Framework for Graphene Nanoribbon Quantum Sensing: Theory, Verification, and Multi-Modal Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $\eta_{\text{enh}} \propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $\delta = 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2\pi\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities. This unified framework provides design principles for next-generation graphene quantum sensors with analytically predictable performance.</description>

      <title>Combining laser ablation and Sol-Gel techniques for the synthesis of nanostructured organic-inorganic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we report a new and simple method that combines the pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) and the Sol-Gel techniques to obtain nanocomposite glasses and gelatins. Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are generated by PLAL using the corresponding target. The target is submerged in a transparent liquid solution made previously with tetraetylorthosilicate (TEOS) adding diluted hydrochloric acid as catalyzer. In the case of gelatins commercial gelatin and tap water are used. The laser source is a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm, with an energy of 100 mJ and 8 ns pulse duration at 10 Hz repetition rate focused on the target in a 2 mm diameter laser spot. The ablation time is 10 min for the glasses and gelatins. The Au-NPs are uniformly dispersed in the solution. After the ablation process the gels are sealed and stored at room temperature for several days. The samples are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, HRTEM, ellipsometry and AFM microscopy, these measurements reveal optical transparency and a refractive index near 1.45 for the pure glass, whereas a colorful aspect, a refractive index of 1.42, and a small surface roughness of 1.92 nm for the glass containing Au-NPs. In the case of gelatins self-sustained flexible films are obtained.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of magnons and phonons in Ni80Fe20 nanodot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of collective spin excitations by static or dynamic strain is an emerging phenomenon that requires in-depth understanding for design of future spin-wave-regulated devices. Here, we explore mutually interacting spin waves and acoustic wave modes in addition to few non-interactive modes through all optical excitation in ordered arrays of Ni80Fe20 nanomagnets. The acoustic wave originated from elastic deformation resonantly couple to the spin wave via magnetoelastic effect at their overlapping frequency. We demonstrate that the choice of the lattice type in which the magnetic nanodots are arranged is crucial for the observation of the magnetoelastic interaction. Therefore, the study shows that the simultaneous existence of elastic wave and spin wave offer ingeneously advantageous features to pave the way of energy-efficient magnetoacoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional thermal conductivity of suspended zigzag graphene nanomesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to the study of graphene itself, the study of nano-structured graphene is rather limited because it is difficult to prepare atomically ordered edges. In this study, we have fabricated a periodically patterned mesh structure of graphene with atomically precise zigzag edges (zGNM: zigzag graphene nanomesh) and studied its thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) by opto-thermal Raman measurement. Unintuitively, it is found that the $\kappa$ of zGNM of 2,3 monolayers (MLs) thick is inversely proportional to the nanoribbon width ($W$), while that of zGNM of 5$\sim$10 MLs thick is independent of $W$ down to 30 nm. Since the $\kappa$ of suspended zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) is suppressed by decreasing $W$, this nonclassical behavior of zGNM is due to the mesh structure. In addition, zGNRs show a higher $\kappa$ than GNRs with atomically rough edges. This is probably due to the atomically ordered zigzag edges.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale wireframe SQUID on a cantilever by corner lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fabrication of nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) at the apex of wireframe tips on self-aligned superconducting cantilever probes. The probes are made on silicon wafers using molding techniques in combination with corner lithography, which results in a nanowire frame tip with a tuneable apex structure. A shadow effect deposition using magnetron sputtering of Nb creates self-aligned superconducting wireframes on cantilevers with accompanying device circuitry. Superconducting weak links are realized at the apex of the wireframes with the use of focused ion beam nanopatterning. The realized SQUIDs have effective diameters ranging from several micrometers down to 100 nm and can be operated in magnetic fields up to 1 T. Furthermore, the nanowires in the wireframe can be used to flux modulate the SQUID locally. This fabrication process enables the production of wafer-scale templates for probes based on on-tip superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Conductance Oscillations in a Topological Insulator-Disordered Superconductor Hybrid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation on proximity-induced superconductivity in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 coupled to a disordered superconductor, amorphous indium oxide (a-InO). Resistance temperature measurements reveal superconducting signatures at low temperatures, even when InO is in an insulating state, indicating the persistence of superconducting correlations. Differential conductance spectra reveal nearly periodic oscillations at higher bias, together with a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak. Both effect disappears at high temperature, marking the critical temperature (T*) of the superconducting islands in InO. These results underscore the influence of topological surface states on proximity-induced superconductivity and highlight the role of superconducting fluctuations in disordered superconductor/topological-insulator hybrid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Geometrical optical activity induced by a continuous distribution of screw dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study light propagation in a medium with uniform torsion, modeled as a continuum of screw dislocations within the geometric theory of defects. By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $\Delta\theta = \Omega\rho L$, linear in the dislocation density $\Omega$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $\rho$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $\Delta n = 2c\Omega\rho/\omega$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Intrinsic Janus Structures: Design Principle and Anomalous Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Janus structures have garnered rapidly growing attention across multidisciplinary fields. However, despite extensive theoretical and experimental efforts, a principle for designing intrinsic Janus materials remains elusive. Here, we propose a first-principles alloy theory based on cluster expansion, incorporating a strong repulsive interaction of a cation-mediated anion-pair cluster and refined short-range cluster-cluster competitions, to unravel the formation mechanism of intrinsic Janus structures with a distorted 1T phase among numerous competing phases. Our theory not only explains why intrinsic Janus structures are accidentally observed in RhSeCl and BiTeI which are composed of alloyed elements from different groups, but also accurately predicts a wide range of 1T-like intrinsic Janus materials that are ready for synthesis. Intriguingly, as demonstrated in the case of RhSeCl, we reveal that intrinsic Janus materials can exhibit anomalous second-harmonic generation (SHG) with a distinct quantum geometric effect, originating from strong lattice and chemical-potential mirror asymmetry. Furthermore, a novel skin effect unexpectedly emerges in finite-thickness RhSeCl, accompanied by a hidden SHG effect within the bulk region. Our theory paves the way for the ab initio design of intrinsic Janus materials, significantly accelerating progress in Janus science.</description>

      <title>Microscopic quantum description of surface plasmon polaritons: revealing intrinsic ultrastrong light-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic quantum theory of surface plasmon polaritons valid for arbitrary metal-dielectric geometries. Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index. These results open new intriguing perspectives in the field of quantum plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Controlled Parity of Cooper Pair Tunneling in a Hybrid Superconducting Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cos\phi$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(k\phi)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pm\pi/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Radiative Energy Transfer Enables Stable, Low-Threshold Lasing in Hybrid Quantum Dot-Nanoplatelet Supraparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are promising building blocks for optoelectronics due to their solution processability, spectral tunability, and ability to self-assemble into complex architectures. However, their use in lasing application remains limited by high working thresholds, rapid nonradiative losses from Auger recombination, and sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we report hybrid microscale supraparticles composed of core/shell CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and CdSe/CdxZn1-xS nanoplatelets (NPLs), which overcome these limitations through efficient, cavity-mediated energy funneling and coupling. Broadband absorbing QDs rapidly transfer excitation to narrow emitting NPLs, enabling stable whispering gallery mode lasing with a low threshold of 0.35 mJ/cm2. These supraparticles retain optical performance after prolonged exposure to air, water, and continuous irradiation, offering practical advantages for optoelectronic devices and advanced pigment technologies. Ultimately, our approach provides a versatile, programmable platform for optical amplification and tunable emission control within colloidal photonic architectures. Keywords</description>

      <title>Growth of Large Crystals of Janus Phase RhSeCl Using Self-Selecting Vapour Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in 2D Janus materials has grown exponentially, particularly with regard to their applications in spintronics and optoelectronic devices. The defining feature of Janus materials is the ordered arrangement of different layer terminations - creating chemically distinct surfaces and an inherent out-of-plane polarity. Among the few known Janus materials, RhSeCl is particularly intriguing as a rare example of an intrinsic Janus compound. Owing to its exceptional chemical stability, RhSeCl offers a promising platform for exploring the physics related to the Janus-structure. However, synthesising large, high-quality crystals of this compound remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a novel synthetic pathway for growing crystals up to 6 mm in lateral size via a two-step self-selecting vapour growth reaction. We further present a comprehensive comparison of newly developed synthesis routes with all previously reported methods for RhSeCl. During these investigations, we identified a previously unreported impurity that forms in specific growth pathways and demonstrate how it can be avoided to obtain phase-pure few- and monolayer flakes. We showcase the reproducibility of the process to obtain high-quality, large single-crystals and flakes.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors</description>

      <title>Raman scattering fingerprints of the charge density wave state in one-dimensional NbTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-density waves (CDWs) are ordered quantum states of conduction electrons accompanied by periodic lattice distortions. Raman scattering (RS) spectroscopy is therefore well suited for probing CDW-induced structural modulations. We investigate the CDW state in quasi-one-dimensional NbTe$_4$ using RS spectroscopy. At $T$=5~K, the resonantly enhanced Raman spectrum exhibits 25 phonon modes. Polarization-dependent measurements reveal a strong coupling between phonon-mode symmetry and crystallographic symmetry, with modes polarized parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, along which the one-dimensional structure is elongated. Temperature-dependent RS measurements identify a transition between commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, accompanied by pronounced thermal hysteresis, with transition temperatures of approximately 45~K upon cooling and 90~K upon warming. The hysteresis width depends on the warming rate, indicating a finite nucleation rate of CDW domains and suggesting potential relevance for memory-device applications.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Tunable Electronic Structure of Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ has emerged as an attractive material platform to study intriguing phenomena related to topology and strong electron correlations. Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond spin-state switching dynamics of spin-crossover molecules condensed in thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photoinduced switching of Fe(II)-based spin-crossover complexes from singlet to quintet takes place at ultrafast time scales. This a priori spin-forbidden transition triggered numerous time-resolved experiments of solvated samples to elucidate the mechanism at play. The involved intermediate states remain uncertain. We apply ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy in molecular films as a method sensitive to spin, electronic, and nuclear degrees of freedom. Combining the progress in molecule synthesis and film growth with the opportunities at x-ray free-electron lasers, we analyze the transient evolution of the Fe L3 fine structure at room temperature. Our measurements and calculations indicate the involvement of an Fe triplet intermediate state. The high-spin state saturates at half of the available molecules, limited by molecule-molecule interaction within the film.</description>

      <title>Topology of ultra-localized insulators and superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topology of an insulator can be defined even when all eigenstates of the system are localized - an extreme case of Anderson insulators that we call ultra-localized. We derive the classification of such ultra-localized insulators in all symmetry classes and dimensions. We clarify their bulk-boundary correspondence and show that ultra-localized systems are in many instances phases of matter not described by the known classification of topological insulators and superconductors. As a consequence, we clarify which conventional topological phases are Wannierizable, and which topological phases cannot exist without delocalized states.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoconductivity in chiral multifold semimetals exemplified by pseudospin-1 nodal points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artefact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes, offering an overwhelmingly rich set of possibilities. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</description>

      <title>A molecule with half-M\"obius topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>

      <title>SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moir\'e Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments, which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.</description>

Abstract: High-quality micropillar cavities were grown using molecular-beam epitaxy. Stable continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature was demonstrated for microlasers with semiconductor and hybrid output mirrors. At 300 K, single-mode lasing was demonstrated for micropillars with a diameter of 5 $\mu$m at a wavelength of 960 nm, with a minimum lasing threshold of 1.2 mW and a bare quality-factor exceeding 8000.</description>
