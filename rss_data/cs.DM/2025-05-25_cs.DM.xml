      <title>Near optimal edge partitioning via intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of edge-centric graph partitioning, where the goal is to distribute the edges of a graph among several almost equally sized partitions in order to minimize the replication factor of vertices. We build a partitioning algorithm that guarantees near-perfect balance and replication factor $\sqrt{n}(1 + o(1))$ for arbitrary number of partitions $n$. This asymptotical bound cannot be improved. To do so, we introduce balanced intersecting systems. It is a construction similar to symmetric intersecting families, but the symmetry condition is replaced by a weaker balance condition. We build an algorithm that uses such a system, and prove that by using a system of optimal cardinality we achieve exactly optimal guarantees for the replication factor. Finally, we build balanced intersecting systems with asymptotically optimal cardinality.</description>

      <title>Advancing Uncertain Combinatorics through Graphization, Hyperization, and Uncertainization: Fuzzy, Neutrosophic, Soft, Rough, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better handle real-world uncertainty, concepts such as fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, and soft sets have been introduced. For example, neutrosophic sets, which simultaneously represent truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood, have proven to be valuable tools for modeling uncertainty in complex systems. These set concepts are increasingly studied in graphized forms, and generalized graph concepts now encompass well-known structures such as hypergraphs and superhypergraphs. Furthermore, hyperconcepts and superhyperconcepts are being actively researched in areas beyond graph theory.
  Combinatorics, uncertain sets (including fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, rough sets, soft sets, and plithogenic sets), uncertain graphs, and hyper and superhyper concepts are active areas of research with significant mathematical and practical implications. Recognizing their importance, this paper explores new graph and set concepts, as well as hyper and superhyper concepts, as detailed in the "Results" section of "The Structure of the Paper." Additionally, this work aims to consolidate recent findings, providing a survey-like resource to inform and engage readers.
  For instance, we extend several graph concepts by introducing Neutrosophic Oversets, Neutrosophic Undersets, Neutrosophic Offsets, and the Nonstandard Real Set. This paper defines a variety of concepts with the goal of inspiring new ideas and serving as a valuable resource for researchers in their academic pursuits.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Claw-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Matching Cut problem is to decide if the vertex set of a connected graph can be partitioned into two non-empty sets $B$ and $R$ such that the edges between $B$ and $R$ form a matching, that is, every vertex in $B$ has at most one neighbour in $R$, and vice versa. If for some integer $d\geq 1$, we allow every neighbour in $B$ to have at most $d$ neighbours in $R$, and vice versa, we obtain the more general problem $d$-Cut. It is known that $d$-Cut is NP-complete for every $d\geq 1$. However, for claw-free graphs, it is only known that $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for $d=1$ and NP-complete for $d\geq 3$. We resolve the missing case $d=2$ by proving NP-completeness. This follows from our more general study, in which we also bound the maximum degree. That is, we prove that for every $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut, restricted to claw-free graphs of maximum degree $p$, is constant-time solvable if $p\leq 2d+1$ and NP-complete if $p\geq 2d+3$. Moreover, in the former case, we can find a $d$-cut in linear time. We also show how our positive results for claw-free graphs can be generalized to $S_{1^t,l}$-free graphs where $S_{1^t,l}$ is the graph obtained from a star on $t+2$ vertices by subdividing one of its edges exactly $l$ times.</description>

      <title>On the geometric $k$-colored crossing number of $K_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \emph{geometric $k$-colored crossing number} of complete graphs $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$, which is the smallest number of monochromatic crossings in any $k$-edge colored straight-line drawing of $K_n$.
  We substantially improve asymptotic upper bounds on $\overline{\overline{\text{cr}}}_k(K_n)$ for $k=2,\ldots, 10$ by developing a procedure for general $k$ that derives $k$-edge colored drawings of $K_n$ for arbitrarily large $n$ from initial drawings with a low number of monochromatic crossings.
  We obtain the latter by heuristic search, employing a \textsc{MAX-$k$-CUT}-formulation of a subproblem in the process.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$.
  We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$.
  The third main result of this paper is the theorem that, for $n \geq 2, \varepsilon &gt; 0$, any automorphism $\phi$ of the unit distance graph of layer $L = L(n,1,2,\varepsilon) = \mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]$ is an isometry. This is related to the Beckman-Quarles theorem of 1953, which states that any unit-preserving mapping of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an isometry, and to the rational analogue of this theorem obtained by A. Sokolov in 2023.</description>
