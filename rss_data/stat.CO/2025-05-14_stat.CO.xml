      <title>rd2d: Causal Inference in Boundary Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary discontinuity designs -- also known as Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs, with Geographic RD designs as a prominent example -- are often used in empirical research to learn about causal treatment effects along a continuous assignment boundary defined by a bivariate score. This article introduces the R package rd2d, which implements and extends the methodological results developed in Cattaneo, Titiunik and Yu (2025) for boundary discontinuity designs. The package employs local polynomial estimation and inference using either the bivariate score or a univariate distance-to-boundary metric. It features novel data-driven bandwidth selection procedures, and offers both pointwise and uniform estimation and inference along the assignment boundary. The numerical performance of the package is demonstrated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Beyond Basic A/B testing: Improving Statistical Efficiency for Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we propose several approaches to addresses these challenges: (i) regression adjustment, generalized estimating equation, Man-Whitney U and Zero-Trimmed U that addresses each of these issues separately, and (ii) a novel doubly robust generalized U that handles ROI consideration, distribution robustness and small samples in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotic normality and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies and apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Dyadic Factorization and Efficient Inversion of Sparse Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inverting large sparse matrices, the key difficulty lies in effectively exploiting sparsity during the inversion process. One well-established strategy is the nested dissection, which seeks the so-called sparse Cholesky factorization. We argue that the matrices for which such factors can be found are characterized by a hidden dyadic sparsity structure. This paper builds on that idea by proposing an efficient approach for inverting such matrices. The method consists of two independent steps: the first packs the matrix into a dyadic form, while the second performs a sparse (dyadic) Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the packed matrix.
  The novel packing procedure works by recovering block-tridiagonal structures, focusing on aggregating terms near the diagonal using the $l_1$-norm, which contrasts with traditional methods that prioritize minimizing bandwidth, i.e. the $l_\infty$-norm. The algorithm performs particularly well for matrices that can be packed into banded or dyadic forms which are moderately dense. Due to the properties of $l_1$-norm, the packing step can be applied iteratively to reconstruct the hidden dyadic structure, which corresponds to the detection of separators in the nested dissection method.
  We explore the algebraic properties of dyadic-structured matrices and present an algebraic framework that allows for a unified mathematical treatment of both sparse factorization and efficient inversion of factors. For matrices with a dyadic structure, we introduce an optimal inversion algorithm and evaluate its computational complexity.
  The proposed inversion algorithm and core algebraic operations for dyadic matrices are implemented in the R package DyadiCarma, utilizing Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for high-performance computing. An independent R-based matrix packing module, supported by C++ code, is also provided.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Causal Effects Using Proxies of a Latent Interference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interference occurs when treatments assigned to some units affect the outcomes of others. Traditional approaches often assume that the observed network correctly specifies the interference structure. However, in practice, researchers frequently only have access to proxy measurements of the interference network due to limitations in data collection or potential mismatches between measured networks and actual interference pathways. In this paper, we introduce a framework for estimating causal effects when only proxy networks are available. Our approach leverages a structural causal model that accommodates diverse proxy types, including noisy measurements, multiple data sources, and multilayer networks, and defines causal effects as interventions on population-level treatments. Since the true interference network is latent, estimation poses significant challenges. To overcome them, we develop a Bayesian inference framework. We propose a Block Gibbs sampler with Locally Informed Proposals to update the latent network, thereby efficiently exploring the high-dimensional posterior space composed of both discrete and continuous parameters. We illustrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering causal effects even when only proxies of the interference network are available.</description>

      <title>neuralGAM: An R Package for Fitting Generalized Additive Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, Neural Networks are considered one of the most effective methods for various tasks such as anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection, or natural language processing. However, these networks suffer from the ``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network architecture. We illustrate the use of the neuralGAM package in both synthetic and real data examples.</description>

      <title>A General Purpose Approximation to the Ferguson-Klass Algorithm for Sampling from L\'evy Processes Without Gaussian Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approximation to the Ferguson-Klass algorithm for generating samples from L\'evy processes without Gaussian components. We show that the proposed method is more than 1000 times faster than the standard Ferguson-Klass algorithm without a significant loss of precision. This method can open an avenue for computationally efficient and scalable Bayesian nonparametric models which go beyond conjugacy assumptions, as demonstrated in the examples section.</description>

      <title>Valid Bootstraps for Network Embeddings with Applications to Network Visualisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in networks is an important step in modelling relationships and interactions between entities. We consider the challenge of bootstrapping an inhomogeneous random graph when only a single observation of the network is made and the underlying data generating function is unknown. We address this problem by considering embeddings of the observed and bootstrapped network that are statistically indistinguishable. We utilise an exchangeable network test that can empirically validate bootstrap samples generated by any method. Existing methods fail this test, so we propose a principled, distribution-free network bootstrap using k-nearest neighbour smoothing, that can pass this exchangeable network test in many synthetic and real-data scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of this work in combination with the popular data visualisation method t-SNE, where uncertainty estimates from bootstrapping are used to explain whether visible structures represent real statistically sound structures.</description>

      <title>Outlier-robust neural network training: variation regularization meets trimmed loss to prevent functional breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we tackle the challenge of outlier-robust predictive modeling using highly expressive neural networks. Our approach integrates two key components: (1) a transformed trimmed loss (TTL), a computationally efficient variant of the classical trimmed loss, and (2) higher-order variation regularization (HOVR), which imposes smoothness constraints on the prediction function. While traditional robust statistics typically assume low-complexity models such as linear and kernel models, applying TTL alone to modern neural networks may fail to ensure robustness, as their high expressive power allows them to fit both inliers and outliers, even when a robust loss is used. To address this, we revisit the traditional notion of breakdown point and adapt it to the nonlinear function setting, introducing a regularization scheme via HOVR that controls the model's capacity and suppresses overfitting to outliers. We theoretically establish that our training procedure retains a high functional breakdown point, thereby ensuring robustness to outlier contamination. We develop a stochastic optimization algorithm tailored to this framework and provide a theoretical guarantee of its convergence.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stochastic 3D modeling of the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in battery cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic 3D modeling approach for the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase in hierarchically structured cathodes of lithium-ion batteries is presented. The binder-conductive additive phase of these electrodes consists of carbon black, polyvinylidene difluoride binder and graphite particles. For its stochastic 3D modeling, a three-step procedure based on methods from stochastic geometry is used. First, the graphite particles are described by a Boolean model with ellipsoidal grains. Second, the mixture of carbon black and binder is modeled by an excursion set of a Gaussian random field in the complement of the graphite particles. Third, large pore regions within the mixture of carbon black and binder are described by a Boolean model with spherical grains. The model parameters are calibrated to 3D image data of cathodes in lithium-ion batteries acquired by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, model validation is performed by comparing model realizations with measured image data in terms of various morphological descriptors that are not used for model fitting. Finally, we use the stochastic 3D model for predictive simulations, where we generate virtual, yet realistic, image data of nanoporous binder-conductive additives with varying amounts of graphite particles. Based on these virtual nanostructures, we can investigate structure-property relationships. In particular, we quantitatively study the influence of graphite particles on effective transport properties in the nanoporous binder-conductive additive phase, which have a crucial impact on electrochemical processes in the cathode and thus on the performance of battery cells.</description>
