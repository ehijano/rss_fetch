      <title>Tracking the creation of single photon emitters in AlN by implantation and annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we inspect and analyze the effect of Al implantation into AlN by conducting confocal microscopy on the ion implanted regions, before and after implantation, followed by an annealing step. The independent effect of annealing is studied in an unimplanted control region, which showed that annealing alone does not produce new emitters. We observed that point-like emitters are created in the implanted regions after annealing by tracking individual locations in a lithographically patterned sample. The newly created quantum emitters show anti-bunching under ambient conditions and are spectrally similar to the previously discovered emitters in as-grown AlN.</description>

      <title>Optimization of passive superconductors for shaping stellarator magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the novel problem of optimizing a large set of passive superconducting coils (PSCs) with currents induced by a background magnetic field rather than power supplies. In the nuclear fusion literature, such coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators and provide passive stabilization. We perform the first optimizations of PSC arrays with respect to the orientation, shape, and location of each coil, jointly minimized with the background fields. We conclude by generating passive coil array solutions for four stellarators.</description>

      <title>Current Opinions on Memristor-Accelerated Machine Learning Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented advancement of artificial intelligence has placed immense demands on computing hardware, but traditional silicon-based semiconductor technologies are approaching their physical and economic limit, prompting the exploration of novel computing paradigms. Memristor offers a promising solution, enabling in-memory analog computation and massive parallelism, which leads to low latency and power consumption. This manuscript reviews the current status of memristor-based machine learning accelerators, highlighting the milestones achieved in developing prototype chips, that not only accelerate neural networks inference but also tackle other machine learning tasks. More importantly, it discusses our opinion on current key challenges that remain in this field, such as device variation, the need for efficient peripheral circuitry, and systematic co-design and optimization. We also share our perspective on potential future directions, some of which address existing challenges while others explore untouched territories. By addressing these challenges through interdisciplinary efforts spanning device engineering, circuit design, and systems architecture, memristor-based accelerators could significantly advance the capabilities of AI hardware, particularly for edge applications where power efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Pristine Molecular Orbitals from Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images via Artificial Intelligence Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular orbital (MO) is one of the most fundamental concepts for molecules, relating to all branches of chemistry, while scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been widely recognized for its potential to measure the spatial distribution of MOs. However, the precise characterization of MO with high resolution in real space is a long-standing challenge owing to the inevitable interference of high-angular-momentum contributions from functionalized tips in STM. Here, leveraging advances in artificial intelligence for image recognition, we establish a physics-driven deep-learning network, named STM-Net, to reconstruct MOs from high-resolution STM images with a functionalized tip, taking advantage of the separable characteristics of different angular momentum contributions. We demonstrate that STM-Net can be directly applied to a variety of experimental observations, successfully reconstructing pristine MO features for molecules under diverse conditions. Moreover, STM-Net can adapt to various states of the functionalized tip and the substrate, illustrating the broad applicability of our physics-driven framework. These results pave the way for accurate characterization of MO with high resolution, potentially leading to new insights and applications for this fundamental concept in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Polarization Inversion with $\mathcal{P}\cdot\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathcal{D}$ Symmetric Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that arbitrary scatterers preserving parity-time-duality ($\mathcal{P}\cdot\mathcal{T}\cdot\mathcal{D}$) symmetry inherently produce a backscattered wave whose electric field is the mirror-symmetric counterpart of the incident electric field, up to an amplitude factor, with respect to the system's characteristic mirror plane. Specifically, we establish that a general elliptically polarized wave, when reflected from such structures, exhibits a polarization state related to the polarization ellipse of the incident wave by a parity transformation. Notably, a circularly polarized wave reflects with spin angular momentum opposite to that of the incident field, in stark contrast to reflection from conventional conducting screens. These findings enable several applications such as reflective polarizers.</description>

      <title>Temporally symmetry-broken metasurfaces for ultrafast resonance creation and annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces, compact platforms for nanoscale light manipulation, are transforming technologies like holography, quantum cryptography, and optical computing. Despite their versatility, tunability in metasurfaces has mainly relied on shifting the resonance wavelength or increasing material losses to spectrally detune or quench resonant modes, respectively. However, both methods face fundamental limitations, such as limited Q-factor and near-field enhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on/off switching by completely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far-field. Here, we demonstrate temporal symmetry-breaking in metasurfaces via ultrafast optical pumping, marking the first experimental realization of radiative loss-driven resonance creation, annihilation, broadening, and sharpening. We introduce restored symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum as a new concept which are central to the realization of temporal symmetry-breaking. These states arise in metasurfaces with geometrically asymmetric unit cells, where the total dipole moment, composed of two antisymmetric dipoles, cancels out. Mie-resonant optical absorption within specific regions of the unit cell locally modifies the refractive index, disrupting the balance between the two dipole moments. A total dipole moment is thereby created or annihilated, and consequently, the radiative loss is tuned. This enables full control over coupling to incoming light, allowing precise adjustment of the resonance linewidth, near-field enhancement, and resonance amplitude. Our work establishes radiative loss-based active metasurfaces with potential applications ranging from high-speed optical and quantum communications to time-crystals and photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Observation of Strong Nonreciprocal Thermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kirchhoff`s law of thermal radiation stating the equivalence of emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength, angle, and polarization, has completely constrained emission and absorption processes. Achieving strong nonreciprocal emission points to fundamental advances for applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and sensing, but strong nonreciprocal thermal emission has not been experimentally realized. Here, we observe strong nonreciprocal thermal emission using a custom-designed angle-resolved magnetic thermal emission spectroscopy and an epitaxially-transferred gradient-doped metamaterial. We show that under magnetic field, the metamaterial strongly breaks the Kirchhoff`s law, with a difference between emissivity and absorptivity at the same wavelength and angle reaching as high as 0.43. Significant nonreciprocal emission persists over broad spectral and angular ranges. The demonstration of strong nonreciprocal thermal emission and the approach can be useful for systematic exploration of nonreciprocal thermal photonics for thermal management, infrared camouflage, and energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale robust graphene electronics under industrial processing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For commercial grade electronic devices, stable structures are required to ensure a long device life span. When such devices contain nanomaterials like graphene, it is crucial that these materials resist industrial processes and harsh environments. For environments that contain water, graphene delamination is a notorious drawback, as water intercalation and eventually liftoff readily occur in aqueous and especially in alkaline solutions. This limitation renders graphene incompatible with key wafer-processing steps in the semiconductor industry. In this work, a covalent pyrene-based adhesion layer is synthesized in a facile, two-step procedure. Through {\pi}-{\pi} interactions, the adhesion of graphene to silicon wafers was maintained under conditions that resemble harsh processes, i.e. acidic and alkaline solutions, several organic solvents, and sonication. Moreover, they could be produced with a device measurement yield up to 99.7% and reproducible device-to-device electronic performance on 4-inch silicon wafers. Our results show that a straightforward functionalization of silicon wafers with an adhesive layer can be directly applicable in industrial-scale fabrication processes, giving access to robust graphene field effect devices that are built to last long.</description>

      <title>Selective Actuation Enabled Multifunctional Magneto-mechanical Metamaterial for Programming Elastic Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active metamaterials are a type of metamaterial with tunable properties enabled by structural reconfigurations. Existing active metamaterials often achieve only a limited number of structural reconfigurations upon the application of an external load across the entire structure. Here, we propose a selective actuation strategy for inhomogeneous deformations of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which allows for the integration of multiple elastic wave tuning functionalities into a single metamaterial design. Central to this actuation strategy is that a magnetic field is applied to specific unit cells instead of the entire metamaterial, and the unit cell can transform between two geometrically distinct shapes, which exhibit very different mechanical responses to elastic wave excitations. Our numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate that the tunable response of the unit cell, coupled with inhomogeneous deformation achieved through selective actuation, unlocks multifunctional capabilities of magneto-mechanical metamaterials such as tunable elastic wave transmittance, elastic waveguide, and vibration isolation. The proposed selective actuation strategy offers a simple but effective way to control the tunable properties and thus enhances the programmability of magneto-mechanical metamaterials, which also expands the application space of magneto-mechanical metamaterials in elastic wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. Specifically, there are a total of 26 Rashba semiconductors with isolated spin splitting bands contributed by Se/Te-pz orbitals at conduction band minimum, and their Rashba constant is closely related to the intrinsic electric field and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. As the atomic number increases, the bandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a point where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs and it reopens with a nontrivial topology. In conjunction with band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double Rashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be further effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a continuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different spin textures. This work provides new insights into Rashba and topology physics and further presents indispensable inversion asymmetry materials for the development of nonlinear optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Atomic-scale Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin states in semiconductors provide exceptionally stable and noise-resistant environments for qubits, positioning them as optimal candidates for reliable quantum computing technologies. The proposal to use nuclear and electronic spins of donor atoms in silicon, introduced by Kane in 1998, sparked a new research field focused on the precise positioning of individual impurity atoms for quantum devices, utilising scanning tunnelling microscopy and ion implantation. This roadmap article reviews the advancements in the 25 years since Kane's proposal, the current challenges, and the future directions in atomic-scale semiconductor device fabrication and measurement. It covers the quest to create a silicon-based quantum computer and expands to include diverse material systems and fabrication techniques, highlighting the potential for a broad range of semiconductor quantum technological applications. Key developments include phosphorus in silicon devices such as single-atom transistors, arrayed few-donor devices, one- and two-qubit gates, three-dimensional architectures, and the development of a toolbox for future quantum integrated circuits. The roadmap also explores new impurity species like arsenic and antimony for enhanced scalability and higher-dimensional spin systems, new chemistry for dopant precursors and lithographic resists, and the potential for germanium-based devices. Emerging methods, such as photon-based lithography and electron beam manipulation, are discussed for their disruptive potential. This roadmap charts the path toward scalable quantum computing and advanced semiconductor quantum technologies, emphasising the critical intersections of experiment, technological development, and theory.</description>
