      <title>Fibonacci Lie algebra revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe old and prove new results on properties of the Fibonacci Lie algebra in a self-contained exposition. First, we study the growth of this algebra in more details. So, we show that the polynomial behaviour of the growth function in not uniform. We establish bounds on the growth of its universal enveloping algebra. We find bounds on nilpotency indices for elements of the Fibonacci restricted Lie algebra. We prove that the Fibonacci Lie algebra is not PI. Our approach is also based on geometric ideas. The Fibonacci Lie algebra is $\mathbb Z^2$-graded and its homogeneous components belong to a strip. We illustrate the results by computing the initial components and show positions of the homogeneous components in the strip. We also discuss properties and conjectures on related associative algebras and (restricted) Poisson algebras. Second, we prove infiniteness results on homology and Euler characteristic of arbitrary finitely generated graded Lie algebras of subexponential growth. In case of the Fibonacci Lie algebra, we find bounds on the homology groups and the Euler characteristic, and determine respective positions on plane. The computation of the initial part of the Euler characteristic of the Fibonacci Lie algebra shows that its behaviour is really chaotic. Finally, we formulate results and conjectures on homology groups and infinite presentation.</description>

      <title>Some Artin-Schelter Regular Algebras From Dual Reflection Groups and their Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group coacting on an Artin-Schelter regular algebra $A$ homogeneously and inner-faithfully. When the identity component $A_e$ is also Artin-Schelter regular, providing a generalization of the Shephard-Todd-Chevalley Theorem, we say that $G$ is a dual reflection group for $A$. We give two examples of dual reflection groups of order 16, and study algebraic and geometric properties of three associated Artin-Schelter regular algebras of dimension four.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Polygonal Cluster Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new family of noncommutative generalizations of cluster algebras called polygonal cluster algebras. These algebras generalize the noncommutative surfaces of Berenstein-Retakh, and are inspired by the emerging theory of $\Theta$-positivity for the groups $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$. They are generated by mutations of quivers which we call ST-compatible, and which encode the order of the products that appear in the exchange relations. We show that these ST-compatible quivers can be represented by tilings of surfaces by polygons, a generalization of the description of surface type cluster algebras. As examples, we construct tilings which produce ST-compatible versions of the Del Pezzo quivers and the quivers first described by Le for Fock-Goncharov coordinates for Lie groups of type $B$. We show that polygonal cluster algebras have natural evaluations in Clifford algebras, which we use to produce noncommutative generalizations of the Somos sequences and to parameterize the $\Theta$-positive semigroup of $\mathrm{Spin}(2,n)$. We indicate how this will be done for the semigroup in $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$ and how one will give coordinates for general $\Theta$-positive representations into $\mathrm{Spin}(p,q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid abelian groups, as introduced by Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze, form a subcategory of all condensed abelian groups satisfying some ''completeness'' conditions and having favourable categorical properties. Given a profinite ring $R$, there is an associated condensed ring $\underline{R}$ which is solid. We show that the natural embedding of profinite $R$-modules into solid $\underline{R}$-modules preserves $\mathrm{Ext}$ and tensor products, as well as the fact that profinite rings are analytic.</description>

      <title>2-generated axial algebras of Monster type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.10315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the basic setup for the project, initiated by Felix Rehren, aiming at classifying all 2-generated axial algebras of Monster type $(\alpha,\beta)$ over a field $\mathbb F$. Using this, we first show that every such algebra has dimension at most 8, except for the case $(\alpha,\beta)=(2,\tfrac{1}{2})$, where the Highwater algebra provides examples of dimension $n$, for all $n\in {\mathbb N}\cup \{\infty\}$. We then classify all 2-generated axial algebras of Monster type $(\alpha,\beta)$ over ${\mathbb Q}(\alpha,\beta)$, for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ algebraically independent over $\mathbb Q$. Finally, we generalise the Norton-Sakuma Theorem to every primitive $2$-generated axial algebra of Monster type $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{32})$ over a field of characteristic zero, dropping the hypothesis on the existence of a Frobenius form.</description>

      <title>Global Representation Ring and Knutson Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets. These are obtained from mixed double Poisson algebras, a new class of algebraic structures that are introduced and studied in the present work.</description>

      <title>On Krull-Gabriel dimension of cluster repetitive categories and cluster-tilted algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume that $K$ is an algebraically closed field and denote by $KG(R)$ the Krull-Gabriel dimension of $R$, where $R$ is a locally bounded $K$-category (or a bound quiver $K$-algebra). Assume that $C$ is a tilted $K$-algebra and $\widehat{C},\check{C},\widetilde{C}$ are the associated repetitive category, cluster repetitive category and cluster-tilted algebra, respectively. Our first result states that $KG(\widetilde{C})=KG(\check{C})\leq KG(\widehat{C})$. Since the Krull-Gabriel dimensions of tame locally support-finite repetitive categories are known, we further conclude that $KG(\widetilde{C})=KG(\check{C})=KG(\widehat{C})\in\{0,2,\infty\}$. Finally, in the Appendix Grzegorz Bobi\'nski presents a different way of determining the Krull-Gabriel dimension of the cluster-tilted algebras, by applying results of Geigle.</description>

      <title>Characterization and examples of commutative isoartinian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noetherian rings have played a fundamental role in commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, and algebraic geometry. Along with their dual, Artinian rings, they have many generalizations, including the notions of isonoetherian and isoartinian rings. In this paper, we prove that the Krull dimension of every isoartinian ring is at most one. We then use this result to provide a characterization of isoartinian rings. Specifically, we prove that a ring $R$ is isoartinian if and only if $R$ is uniquely isomorphic to the direct product of a finite number of rings of the following types: (i) Artinian local rings; (ii) non-Noetherian isoartinian local rings with a nilpotent maximal ideal; (iii) non-field principal ideal domains; (iv) Noetherian isoartinian rings $A$ with $\Min A$ being a singleton and $\Min A \subsetneq \Ass A$; (v) non-Noetherian isoartinian rings $A$ with $\Min A$ being a singleton and $\Min A \subsetneq \Ass A$; (vi) non-Noetherian isoartinian rings $A$ with a unique element in $\Min A$ that is not maximal, and $\Min A=\Ass A$. Several examples of these types of rings are also provided.</description>
