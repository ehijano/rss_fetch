      <title>QARPET: A Crossbar Chip for Benchmarking Semiconductor Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale integration of semiconductor spin qubits into industrial quantum processors hinges on the ability to characterize the performance of quantum components at scale. While the semiconductor industry has addressed scalable testing for transistors using device matrix arrays, extending this approach to quantum dot spin qubits is challenged by their operation at sub-kelvin temperatures, in the presence of magnetic fields, and by the use of radio-frequency signals. Here, we present QARPET (Qubit-Array Research Platform for Engineering and Testing), a scalable architecture for characterizing spin qubits using a quantum dot crossbar array with sublinear scaling of interconnects. The crossbar features tightly pitched (1 {\mu}m), individually addressable spin qubit tiles and is implemented in planar germanium, by fabricating a large device with the potential to host 1058 hole spin qubits. We focus our measurements on a patch of 40 tiles and demonstrate key device functionality at millikelvin temperature including unique tile addressability, threshold voltage and charge noise statistics, and characterisation of hole spin qubits and their coherence times in a single tile. These demonstrations pave the way for a new generation of quantum devices designed for the statistical characterisation of spin qubits and for developing automated routines for quantum dot tuning and spin qubit operation.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport through a Majorana zero modes interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermoelectric characteristics of a system consisting of two topological superconducting nanowires, each exhibiting Majorana zero modes at their ends, connected to leads within an interferometer configuration. By employing Green's function formalism, we derive the spectral properties and transport coefficients. Our findings indicate that bound states in the continuum (BICs) manifest in symmetric setups, influenced by the length of the wires and coupling parameters. Deviations of the magnetic flux from specific values transform BICs into quasi-BICs with finite width, resulting in conductance antiresonances. The existence and interplay of Majorana zero modes enhance thermoelectric performance in asymmetric configurations. Modulating the magnetic flux transitions BICs into quasi-BICs significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit, thereby proposing a strategy for optimizing thermoelectric efficiency in systems based on Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Entropic modulation of divalent cation transport through porous two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores in two-dimensional materials by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of \textit{monovalent} cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. More specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state with an entropic cost of order $9k_BT$. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Heat Transport via Evanescent Radiation by Hot Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.</description>

      <title>Influence of doping on non-equilibrium carrier dynamics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling doping is key to optimizing graphene for high-speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, its impact on non-equilibrium carrier lifetimes remains debated. Here, we systematically tune the doping level of quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) via potassium deposition and probe its ultrafast carrier dynamics directly in the band structure using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES). We find that increased doping lowers both the peak electronic temperature and the cooling rate of Dirac carriers, which we attribute to higher electronic heat capacity and reduced phonon emission phase space. Comparing quasi-freestanding graphene with graphene on a carbon buffer layer reveals faster relaxation in the latter, likely due to additional phonon modes being available for heat dissipation. These findings offer new insights for optimizing graphene in electronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the $g$-tensor formalism of semiconductor spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $g$-tensor formalism is a powerful method for describing the electrical driving of semiconductor spin qubits. However, up to now, this technique has only been applied to the simplest qubit dynamics, resonant monochromatic driving by a single gate. Here we study the description of (i) monochromatic driving using two driving gates and bichromatic driving via (ii) one or (iii) two gates. Assuming a general Hamiltonian with qubit states well separated from excited orbital states, we find that when (i) two driving gates are used for monochromatic driving or (ii) a single one for bichromatic, the $g$-tensor formalism successfully captures the leading-order dynamics. We express the Rabi frequency and the Bloch-Siegert shift using the $g$-tensor and its first and second derivatives with respect to the gate voltage. However, when (iii) bichromatic driving is realized using two distinct driving gates, we see a breakdown of $g$-tensor formalism: the Rabi frequency cannot be expressed using the $g$-tensor and its derivatives. We find that beyond the $g$-tensor and its derivatives, three additional parameters are needed to capture the dynamics. We demonstrate our general results by assuming an electron (hole) confined in a circular quantum dot, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Space-averaged non-equilibrium Green's function approach for quantum transport in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach offers a practical framework for simulating various phenomena in mesoscopic systems. As the dimension of electronic devices shrinks to just a few nanometers, the need for new effective-mass based 3D implementations of NEGF has become increasingly apparent. This work extends our previous Finite-Volume implementation -- originally developed for the self-consistent solution of the Schr\"odinger and Poisson equations in 2D -- into a full 3D NEGF framework. Our implementation begins with exploring a few problems with the common textbook Finite Difference implementations of NEGF. We then concisely demonstrate how Finite-Volume discretization addresses few key implementation challenges. Importantly, we explain how this type of discretization enables evaluating the self-energies, which account for the effects of reservoirs. The potential applications of this new method are illustrated through two examples. We anticipate that this implementation will be broadly applicable to open quantum systems, especially in cases where a fully three-dimensional domain is essential.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Without Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the Zeeman coupling between its stray magnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit interaction. The underlying photonic spin of the AC magnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable hot electron extraction in a two-dimensional semiconductor heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot carrier solar cells (HCSCs), harvesting excess energy of the hot carriers generated by above-band-gap photoexcitation, is crucial for pushing the solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley Queisser limit, which is challenging to realize mainly due to fast hot-carrier cooling. By performing transient reflectance spectroscopy in a MoSe2/hBN/WS2 junction, we demonstrate the gate-tunable harvest of hot electrons from MoSe2 to WS2. By spectrally distinguishing hot-electron extraction from lattice temperature increase, we find that electrostatically doped electrons in MoSe2 can boost hot-electron extraction density (n_ET) by factor up to several tens. Such enhancement arises from interaction between hot excitons and doped electrons, which converts the excess energy of hot excitons to excitations of the Fermi sea and hence generates hot electrons. Moreover, n_ET can be further enhanced by reducing the conduction band offset with external electric field. Our results provide in-depth insights into design of HCSCs with electrostatic strategies.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-orbit splitting in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) presents a challenge for spin and valley manipulation, as these applications operate more efficiently in the presence of strong SOC. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) significantly enhances SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been experimentally demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D-nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding device quality, SOC strength, and tunability. In this work, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we demonstrate a reproducible enhancement of spin-orbit splitting ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$) reaching values of up to $1.5\mathrm{meV}$ - more than one order of magnitude higher than in pristine bilayer graphene ($\Delta_\mathrm{SO}=40-80\mu\mathrm{eV}$). Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression by varying the perpendicular electric field, thereby controlling layer polarization. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish SOC as an efficient control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</description>

      <title>Phonon mediated spin polarization in a one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative study of electronic transport and spin polarization between clean and Aubry-Andre-Harper chains in the presence of electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions is presented. The entire system is simulated within a tight-binding framework based on the Hubbard-Holstein model. Transmission probability and spin polarization are evaluated using the Green's function method under the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation through a self-consistent procedure. The transmission profile is found to be consistent with the band structure, which is also discussed. An overall enhancement of spin polarization induced by e-ph interaction is reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our analysis may be useful for studying controlled spin-selective electron transmission in the presence of e-ph coupling.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity ground state in dilute Yu-Shiba-Rusinov dimers and chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on superconductors induce Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which are key to the design of low-dimensional correlated systems and topological superconductivity. Competing magnetic interactions and superconducting pairing lead to a rich phase diagram. Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we position Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$ to build a dimer with an odd-parity ground state, i.e., a partially screened YSR channel with the hybridized states spanning the Fermi level. This ground state makes the dimer a promising precursor for a topological YSR chain. By adding one atom at a time, we track the formation of YSR bands. The lowest-energy band crosses the Fermi level and we find strong site-dependent spectral variations especially at the chain's terminations. We attribute these features to quantum spin effects and ferromagnetic coupling influenced by the local chemical environment, rather than topological superconductivity or Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal waves in two-dimensional electron systems with temperature gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the interaction of dc temperature gradient with ac magnetic field in temperature-biased two-dimensional electron systems leads to formation of a new electromagnetic mode, a two-dimensional thermomagnetic wave (2d TMW). This wave is transverse electric and non-reciprocal, and its damping rate can be lower than that of conventional 2d plasma waves. The Q-factor of 2d TMW is independent of the wave vector. Numerical estimates show that in state-of-the-art two-dimensional electrons systems the 2d TMW Q-factor is the order of $10^{-3}$. We discuss possible ways to overcome this issue.</description>

      <title>Fractional chiral second-order topological insulator from a three-dimensional array of coupled wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model of a three-dimensional chiral second-order topological insulator (SOTI) from an array of weakly coupled nanowires. We show that, in a suitable parameter regime, the interplay between rotating magnetic fields and spatially modulated interwire tunnelings leads to the opening of gaps in the bulk and surface spectrum of the system, while one or more chiral hinge states propagating along a closed path of one-dimensional hinges are left gapless. The exact path of these hinge states is determined by the hierarchy of interwire couplings and the boundary termination of the sample. Depending on the ratio between the period of the rotating magnetic field and the Fermi wavelength, our model can realize both integer and fractional chiral SOTIs. The fractional regime emerges in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and features hinge states carrying only a fraction $e/p$ of the electronic charge $e$ for a positive odd integer $p$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Candidate States of $\nu=12/5$ in Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency short noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.</description>

      <title>Appearance of Multiple Spectral Gaps in Voltage-Biased Josephson Junctions Without Floquet Hybridization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-periodic drive enables the engineering of non-equilibrium quantum systems by hybridizing Floquet sidebands. We investigated DC voltage-biased planar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in which the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a time-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is performed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the evolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe multiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise from a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the superconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our numerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width to coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization. This work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing voltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and provides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet effects.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e enhanced flat band in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moir\'e potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir\'e interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moir\'e potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moir\'e bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moir\'e potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian and effective temperature of non-Hermitian quantum spin ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Charge-Transfer at Metal-Organic Interfaces Using Designer Shockley Surface States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic interfaces determine critical processes in organic electronic devices. The frontier molecular orbitals (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, HOMO and LUMO) are crucial in determining charge-injection and -collection processes into and from the organic semiconductor films. Here we show that we are able to tune the interfacial electronic structure of a strongly interacting interfacial system formed by adsorption of the electron acceptor 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN, C18N12) on Ag thin films on Cu(111). The thickness-dependent Shockley surface state emerging on this layered metallic system couples to the LUMO, which allows precise control over the energetic position and filling of the charge-transfer interface state relative to the Fermi level (EF). Our ability to tune the interfacial electronic structure while maintaining the structure of the molecular film represents an important step towards designing organic semiconductor interfaces.</description>

      <title>Dial It Down: The Effect of Strongly Interacting Adsorbates on the BiAg2 Rashba Surface State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors interfaced with spin-orbit coupled materials offer a rich playground for fundamental studies of controlling spin dynamics in spintronic devices. The adsorbate-surface interactions at such interfaces play a key role in determining the valence electronic and spin structure and consequently, the device physics as well. Here we present the adsorption and electronic structure of the strong organic electron acceptor 2,7-dinitropyrene-4,5,9,10-tetrone (NO2-PyT, C16H4N2O8) on the Rashba spin-orbit coupled surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111). We show that the strong adsorbate-surface alloy interaction leads to weakening of the electronic coupling between the surface alloy atoms and quench the spin-orbit coupled surface state in BiAg2/Ag(111). Our findings demonstrate an important challenge associated with using molecular adsorbates to tailor the spin polarization in BiAg2/Ag(111), and our work provides guidelines to consider while designing interfacial systems to engineer the spin polarization in Rashba surface alloys.</description>

      <title>Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a giant-mode cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation thresholds. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of ($10^6$), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Coherent Bandgap Modulation Probed by Parametric Nonlinear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions in crystals are powerful tools that seamlessly allow both functionalities of sizeable bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy. While we often assume that the border between the two regimes of modulation and detection is sharp and well-defined, there are experiments where the boundaries fade. The study of these transition regions allows us to identify the real potentials and inherent limitations of the most commonly used optical spectroscopy techniques. Here, we measure and explain the co-existence between bandgap modulation and non-invasive spectroscopy in the case of resonant perturbative nonlinear optics in an atomically thin direct gap semiconductor. We report a clear deviation from the typical quadratic power scaling of second-harmonic generation near an exciton resonance, and we explain this unusual result based on all-optical modulation driven by the intensity-dependent optical Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts in the $\pm$K valleys of the Brillouin zone. Our experimental results are corroborated by analytical and numerical analysis based on the semiconductor Bloch equations, from which we extract the resonant transition dipole moments and dephasing times of the used sample. These findings redefine the meaning of perturbative nonlinear optics by revealing how coherent light-matter interactions can modify the band structure of a crystal, even in the weak-field regime. Furthermore, our results strengthen the understanding of ultrafast all-optical control of electronic states in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in valleytronics, Floquet engineering, and light-wave electronics.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of broken time-reversal symmetry in centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric atomically thin crystals with nonlinear Kerr rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry, together with space-inversion symmetry, is one of the defining properties of crystals, underlying phenomena such as magnetism, topology and non-trivial spin textures. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide an excellent tunable model system to study the interplay between time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry, since both can be engineered on demand by tuning the number of layers and via all-optical bandgap modulation. In this work, we modulate and study time-reversal symmetry using third harmonic Kerr rotation in mono- and bilayer TMDs. By illuminating the samples with elliptically polarized light, we achieve spin-selective bandgap modulation and consequent breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The reduced symmetry modifies the nonlinear susceptibility tensor, causing a rotation of the emitted third harmonic polarization. With this method, we are able to probe broken time-reversal symmetry in both non-centrosymmetric (monolayer) and centrosymmetric (bilayer) crystals. Furthermore, we discuss how the detected third harmonic rotation angle directly links to the spin-valley locking in monolayer TMDs and to the spin-valley-layer locking in bilayer TMDs. Thus, our results define a powerful approach to study broken time-reversal symmetry in crystals regardless of space-inversion symmetry, and shed light on the spin, valley and layer coupling of atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: The ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic nanostructure are crucial for fundamental spintronics devices, motivated by its potential application in spintronics, we theoretically investigate the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of the cylindrical intrinsically magnetic topological insulator $\mathrm{MnBi_{2}Te_{4}}$ quantum wires for both cases. We demonstrate that a few surface states exist between the bulk band gap in the ferromagnetic phase, with only one spin branch. In the antiferromagnetic phase, we show that three coexistent states exist between the energy gaps of the quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Competing interlayer interactions in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene: From spontaneous electric polarization to quasi-magic angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The family of moir\'e materials provides a powerful platform for tuning interlayer couplings via the twist angle in systems with large spatial periodicity. In trilayer graphene systems, interlayer couplings at the two interfaces can possibly be tuned separately, and the competition between these interactions can therefore influence the electronic structure in a significant way. In this study, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (aAB) beyond the continuum model, using first-principles calculations combined with an accurate tight-binding model. We find that at large twist angles, the electronic features of aAB are well described by the interaction between the parabolic bands of the Bernal AB-bilayer and the Dirac bands of the twisted monolayer, resulting in a spontaneous electric polarization in the former that splits the parabolic bands. As the twist angle decreases, the coupling between adjacent layers at the twisted interface becomes dominant, which makes aAB look like twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) interacting with the outer Bernal layer. A moir\'e potential emerges in the TBG-like layers, leading to charge localization, while the outer Bernal layer exhibits charge delocalization with substantial sublattice polarization at the atomic scale. Furthermore, we identify narrow bands with a minimum width at a quasi-magic angle of 1.16 degrees, closely matching the magic angle of TBG. The enhanced electron correlation expected in these narrow bands suggests that aAB is a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We use bosonization, retaining band curvature terms, to analyze the Hall response of interacting bosonic and fermionic two-leg ladders threaded by a flux. We derive an explicit expression of the Hall imbalance in a perturbative expansion in the band curvature, retaining fully the interactions. We show that the flux dependence of the Hall imbalance allows to distinguish the two phases (Meissner and Vortex) that are present for a bosonic ladder. For small magnetic field we relate the Hall resistance, both for bosonic and fermionic ladders, to the density dependence of the charge sitffness of the system in absence of flux. Our expression unveil a universal interaction-independent behavior in the Galilean invariant case.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect: Orbital Skew Scattering and Crossover Between Diffusive and Intrinsic Orbital Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the orbital Hall conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy and impurity density. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. More generally, we argue that the newly unveiled orbital skew scattering mechanism governs the diffusive OHEs of a large class of 2D materials even when the crystal structure is inversion-symmetric. Our work unveils the crucial nature of non-perturbative vertex corrections for a complete description of orbital transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.</description>

We performed single crystal, transmission X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the crystal structure. Additionally, we characterized the samples through magnetization, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements. The $R = \text{Ce}$ system exhibits mixed-valence states and we observe maxima in the heat capacity at $T_1^* = 6 \, \text{K}$ and $T_2^* = 2 \, \text{K}$ (both absent for $R = \text{La}$) with no corresponding features in the resistivity or magnetization. We discuss the potential roles of multipolar and short-ranged/partial order in connection to the $T_1^*$ anomalous order.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the \textit{chiral anomaly}. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ is constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios: the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of (1) the same pseudospin variety and exhibiting Berry-curvature profiles differing by an overall factor of $\chi$, or (2) two distinct pseudospin representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are the leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a generalized Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict, using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase in the presence of disorder, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) in classifying a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. We demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This is relevant since topology may not be uniquely defined by the scattering invariant in short disordered wires. This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>

      <title>Tunable Enhancement of Magnetization Dynamics by Crystal Cut at Interface Exchange Coupled $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$/NiFe Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin dynamics in $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) heterostructures, uncovering a robust mechanism for in-situ modulation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) through precise control of temperature, applied magnetic field and crystal orientation. Employing cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interfacial coupling between the N\'eel vector of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and the magnetization of the Py layer is highly tunable across the Morin transition temperature $(T_M)$. Our experiments reveal distinct resonance behavior for different crystal orientations, highlighting the pivotal role of exchange coupling strength in dictating FMR frequencies. Theoretical modeling corroborates the experimental findings, elucidating the dependence of coupling on the relative alignment of the N\'eel vector and ferromagnetic magnetization. Notably, we achieve significant modulation of FMR frequencies by manipulating the N\'eel vector configuration, facilitated by temperature variations, applied magnetic fields and crystal orientation adjustments. These advancements demonstrate the potential for dynamic control of spin interactions in AFM/FM heterostructures, paving the way for the development of advanced spintronic devices with tunable magnetic properties. Our work provides critical insights into the fundamental interactions governing hybrid spin systems and opens new avenues for the design of versatile, temperature-responsive magnetoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Subband structure of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire: transition from normal type to inverted type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the $6\times6$ Kane model in the spherical approximation, both the electron and the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire are calculated using analytical method. The transcendental equations determining the subband energies in the nanowire are analytically derived by utilizing both the total angular momentum conservation and the hard wall boundary condition. We show there exists topological band transition in the HgTe nanowire, very similar to that demonstrated in a HgTe quantum well. Via tuning the radius of the nanowire, we find there is a gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure. When the radius is larger than the critical radius $R_{\rm c}\approx3.2$ nm, the HgTe nanowire is in the inverted regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of large-amplitude parametric oscillations in few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequencies. Here, we present measurements of the response of few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonators, each driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry between the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. The phase states of parametric oscillations with broken amplitude symmetry can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Therefore, they hold promise as units of binary information.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of Chern insulators in moire rhombohedral heptalayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Space AC Josephson Effect and Intervalley Coherence in Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekul\'e distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley current, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby inducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an orbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent dynamics in other 2D materials like twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular C$-$C single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that specular Andreev reflection occurs stably at altermagnet--superconductor interfaces, which is a phenomenon that has previously been predicted only in a limited range of materials, such as Dirac/Weyl materials with fine-tuned chemical potentials. Furthermore, the characteristic spin-split bands of the altermagnet lead to a distinctive spin polarization in the specular Andreev reflections. By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a photonic flat band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at an avoided crossing near the exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson effect in a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. Remarkably, we find that the current-phase relation (CPR) can be forward or backward skewed due to a pronounced second harmonic term. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. This second harmonic can be measured directly using double SQUID devices. The CPR skewness can be effectively manipulated by electric gating. Moreover, we identify two additional impacts of external electric and magnetic fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. This enhancement is surprising since supercurrents are typically suppressed by magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

      <title>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</title>

Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</description>

Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.</description>

      <title>The Fermi surface of RuO2 measured by quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ has emerged as a promising altermagnet candidate, owing to reports of this material hosting antiferromagnetic ordering accompanied by a spin-split electronic band structure characteristic of time-reversal symmetry-breaking. However, recent studies have robustly questioned this scenario. Here we map the Fermi surface of pristine single-crystalline RuO$_2$. By measuring magnetic quantum oscillations of a bulk thermodynamic property, our study resolves the electronic structure present in the bulk of RuO$_2$. Several Fermi sheets are discerned, with a range of effective quasiparticle masses up to five times that of the bare electron mass. We compare our measurements with the predictions for altermagnetic and nonmagnetic Fermi surfaces deduced from density functional theory calculations. The quantum oscillatory frequency spectra correspond very poorly to the profile expected for the case of altermagnetism; by contrast, they correspond well to the nonmagnetic scenario. Our findings place significant constraints on the bulk magnetic properties of RuO$_2$, and strongly suggest that this material is a paramagnet.</description>
