      <title>OLB: An Open Lora Buoy for Coastal Water Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanographic instrumentation technology is currently under rapid transition towards increasingly open-source technology. Open-source buoys compete with commercial and closed-source buoys both in price, functionality and availability. Long-range radio (LoRa) is a communication technology which is inexpensive both in terms of data transfer cost and power without the need for pre-existing infrastructure. In this paper, we present OLB, an open-source drifter buoy using LoRa for coastal water measurements. OLB is designed to be reliable, low-cost, modifiable and power efficient. We present validation experiments demonstrating that OLB can achieve a radio telemetry range of more than 2 kilometres, and has an expected battery lifetime of up to seven months. Finally, we discuss the role and contribution of OLB in the space of open-source instrumentation and ocean modelling.</description>

      <title>Coupling between sub-mesoscale eddies, internal waves, and turbulence in the deep Mediterranean: A spectral investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction between energy-abundant (sub-)mesoscale eddies and internal waves can lead to turbulence generation and may prove important for replenishment of nutrients for deep-sea life and circulation. However, observational evidence of such interaction is scarce and precise energy transfer is unknown. In this paper, an extensive spectral study is reported using mooring data from nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors in about half-a-cubic hectometer of seawater above a deep flat Northwestern-Mediterranean seafloor. The number of independent data records partially improves statistics for better determination of spectral slopes, which however do not show a roll-off to the viscous dissipation range of turbulence. The spectra hardly show power-laws omega^p having exponent p = -5/3 representing an inertial subrange that evidences shear-induced isotropic turbulence. Instead, they are dominated by p = -7/5 representing a buoyancy subrange, which evidences convection-induced anisotropic turbulence. In contrast with p=-5/3 that indicates a downgradient cascade of energy, p=-7/5 characterizes by an ambiguous cascade direction. At height h&lt;50 m above seafloor, p=-7/5 is found adjacent to instrumental noise. The p=-7/5 is also found in the sub-mesoscale/internal wave band that is elevated in variance by one order of magnitude. It is reasoned that this sub-inertial range cannot represent isotropic motions, hence p .ne. -5/3 at all heights, and a new deep-sea energy cascade is proposed between mesoscales and turbulence dissipation. Only higher up in more stratified waters an inertial subrange is formed. The transition from internal waves into large-scale turbulence follows p = -2, while a higher-frequency transition from 0 to pi phase change reflects overturns of slanted convection or standing-wave breaking leading to isotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>The Tara Polaris scientific vision: Advancing our understanding of the central Arctic Ocean to better address life in the Earth System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Arctic Ocean is currently experiencing, at the forefront of global concerns, the pressures of climate change and global pollution. To boost our ability to understand the state of this ecosystem, its evolution in this context and its resilience, the Tara Ocean Foundation has built the Tara Polar Station (TPS), intended to become a permanent observatory of the central Arctic Ocean. The objective of this initiative is threefold: to deepen our knowledge of the foundations of life in an ice-covered polar ocean, to better understand the dynamics of the coupled ocean-ice-atmosphere system and the role of living organisms, and to identify long-term trends in the main characteristics of the Central Arctic Ocean ecosystem resulting from global change. In this article, we describe the vision that guided the development of the Tara Polaris scientific programme, and more specifically the first of ten transpolar drifts that will be undertaken over the next 20 years aboard the TPS (Tara Polaris I, II, III, etc.). The research activities of the Tara Polaris I expedition will be grouped under four specific but interrelated themes: biosphere-atmosphere interactions, epi- and mesopelagic life in an ice-covered ocean, life in sea ice, and pollution. In addition, a theme that cuts across all environmental compartments and disciplines, and is implemented on all Tara Polaris expeditions, is the establishment of an observatory that will monitor the main sentinels of this ecosystem. This umbrella article introduces these different themes, which are then described in more detail in four other articles in this Special Feature, in addition to an article describing the technical characteristics of the TPS.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary time series attribution for heatwaves over Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events since the beginning of the 21st century has led to the development of new methods to attribute extreme events to anthropogenic climate change. How the extreme event is defined has a major influence on the attribution result. A frequently disregarded or evaded aspect concerns the temporal dependence and the clustering of extremes. This study presents an approach for attributing complete time series during extreme events to anthropogenic forcing. The approach is based on a non-stationary Markov process using bivariate extreme value theory to model the temporal dependence of the time series. We calculate the likelihood ratio of an observational time series from ERA5 given the distributions as estimated from CMIP6 simulations with historical natural-only and natural and anthropogenic forcing scenarios. The spatial fields are condensed by the extremal pattern index as a compact description of spatial extremes. In addition, the study examines the extent to which attribution statements about the occurrence of extreme heat events change when the effect of the mean warming is eliminated. The resulting attribution statement provides very strong evidence for the scenario with anthropogenic drivers over Europe, especially since the beginning of the 21st century. For central and southern Europe, the influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on heatwaves could already have been proven in the 1970s using today's methods. There is no reliable signal apart from a general increase in temperature, neither in terms of the temporal dependence of extreme heat days nor in terms of the shape of the extreme value distribution.</description>

      <title>Microscopy system for in situ sea ice structure and biology observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sea ice harbours a rich community of well-adapted microorganisms that inhabit liquid micro-spaces where extreme conditions prevail. Currently at risk under climate change, the sea-ice microbiome holds mysteries about evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere, which require methodological innovation to be unravelled. Gaining microscopic insight into the internal structure and biology of sea ice has traditionally been limited to destructive and extrusive ice core sampling methods. Here we present an in situ microscopic imaging system to observe undisturbed living microorganisms directly within sea the ice matrix. The complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, including its water crystal lattice, brine channels, air bubbles, and various impurities, presents engineering challenges for the development of this imaging system. Despite the fragile nature of the sea-ice matrix, we could successfully deploy, test and use the new in situ microscope during a recent expedition on the icepack in Arctic. We collected numerous images of live and intact single-celled and colony-forming diatoms, and documented for the first time at such a high resolution some microphysical features of sea ice. The hardware and software design of the endoscope is presented along with acquisition results of the microstructure and diatom images. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential for this new in situ microscopic imaging system to transform the way we study sea ice and to allow a deeper understanding of its complex microstructure and living microorganisms.</description>
