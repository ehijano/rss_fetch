      <title>fMRI Exploration of Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant strides in visual quality assessment, the neural mechanisms underlying visual quality perception remain insufficiently explored. This study employed fMRI to examine brain activity during image quality assessment and identify differences in human processing of images with varying quality. Fourteen healthy participants underwent tasks assessing both image quality and content classification while undergoing functional MRI scans. The collected behavioral data was statistically analyzed, and univariate and functional connectivity analyses were conducted on the imaging data. The findings revealed that quality assessment is a more complex task than content classification, involving enhanced activation in high-level cognitive brain regions for fine-grained visual analysis. Moreover, the research showed the brain's adaptability to different visual inputs, adopting different strategies depending on the input's quality. In response to high-quality images, the brain primarily uses specialized visual areas for precise analysis, whereas with low-quality images, it recruits additional resources including higher-order visual cortices and related cognitive and attentional networks to decode and recognize complex, ambiguous signals effectively. This study pioneers the intersection of neuroscience and image quality research, providing empirical evidence through fMRI linking image quality to neural processing. It contributes novel insights into the human visual system's response to diverse image qualities, thereby paving the way for advancements in objective image quality assessment algorithms.</description>

      <title>G-Refine: A General Quality Refiner for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of Text-to-Image (T2I) models, the quality defects of AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) pose a significant barrier to their widespread adoption. In terms of both perception and alignment, existing models cannot always guarantee high-quality results. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce G-Refine, a general image quality refiner designed to enhance low-quality images without compromising the integrity of high-quality ones. The model is composed of three interconnected modules: a perception quality indicator, an alignment quality indicator, and a general quality enhancement module. Based on the mechanisms of the Human Visual System (HVS) and syntax trees, the first two indicators can respectively identify the perception and alignment deficiencies, and the last module can apply targeted quality enhancement accordingly. Extensive experimentation reveals that when compared to alternative optimization methods, AIGIs after G-Refine outperform in 10+ quality metrics across 4 databases. This improvement significantly contributes to the practical application of contemporary T2I models, paving the way for their broader adoption. The code will be released on https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Refine.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Interactive Image Retrieval With Query Rewriting Using Large Language Models and Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image search stands as a pivotal task in multimedia and computer vision, finding applications across diverse domains, ranging from internet search to medical diagnostics. Conventional image search systems operate by accepting textual or visual queries, retrieving the top-relevant candidate results from the database. However, prevalent methods often rely on single-turn procedures, introducing potential inaccuracies and limited recall. These methods also face the challenges, such as vocabulary mismatch and the semantic gap, constraining their overall effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose an interactive image retrieval system capable of refining queries based on user relevance feedback in a multi-turn setting. This system incorporates a vision language model (VLM) based image captioner to enhance the quality of text-based queries, resulting in more informative queries with each iteration. Moreover, we introduce a large language model (LLM) based denoiser to refine text-based query expansions, mitigating inaccuracies in image descriptions generated by captioning models. To evaluate our system, we curate a new dataset by adapting the MSR-VTT video retrieval dataset to the image retrieval task, offering multiple relevant ground truth images for each query. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system against baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a notable 10\% improvement in terms of recall. Our contributions encompass the development of an innovative interactive image retrieval system, the integration of an LLM-based denoiser, the curation of a meticulously designed evaluation dataset, and thorough experimental validation.</description>

      <title>An automatic mixing speech enhancement system for multi-track audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a speech enhancement system for multitrack audio. The system will minimize auditory masking while allowing one to hear multiple simultaneous speakers. The system can be used in multiple communication scenarios e.g., teleconferencing, invoice gaming, and live streaming. The ITU-R BS.1387 Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) model is used to evaluate the amount of masking in the audio signals. Different audio effects e.g., level balance, equalization, dynamic range compression, and spatialization are applied via an iterative Harmony searching algorithm that aims to minimize the masking. In the subjective listening test, the designed system can compete with mixes by professional sound engineers and outperforms mixes by existing auto-mixing systems.</description>

      <title>ComposerX: Multi-Agent Symbolic Music Composition with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music composition represents the creative side of humanity, and itself is a complex task that requires abilities to understand and generate information with long dependency and harmony constraints. While demonstrating impressive capabilities in STEM subjects, current LLMs easily fail in this task, generating ill-written music even when equipped with modern techniques like In-Context-Learning and Chain-of-Thoughts. To further explore and enhance LLMs' potential in music composition by leveraging their reasoning ability and the large knowledge base in music history and theory, we propose ComposerX, an agent-based symbolic music generation framework. We find that applying a multi-agent approach significantly improves the music composition quality of GPT-4. The results demonstrate that ComposerX is capable of producing coherent polyphonic music compositions with captivating melodies, while adhering to user instructions.</description>

      <title>Deep Boosting Learning: A Brand-new Cooperative Approach for Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text matching remains a challenging task due to heterogeneous semantic diversity across modalities and insufficient distance separability within triplets. Different from previous approaches focusing on enhancing multi-modal representations or exploiting cross-modal correspondence for more accurate retrieval, in this paper we aim to leverage the knowledge transfer between peer branches in a boosting manner to seek a more powerful matching model. Specifically, we propose a brand-new Deep Boosting Learning (DBL) algorithm, where an anchor branch is first trained to provide insights into the data properties, with a target branch gaining more advanced knowledge to develop optimal features and distance metrics. Concretely, an anchor branch initially learns the absolute or relative distance between positive and negative pairs, providing a foundational understanding of the particular network and data distribution. Building upon this knowledge, a target branch is concurrently tasked with more adaptive margin constraints to further enlarge the relative distance between matched and unmatched samples. Extensive experiments validate that our DBL can achieve impressive and consistent improvements based on various recent state-of-the-art models in the image-text matching field, and outperform related popular cooperative strategies, e.g., Conventional Distillation, Mutual Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Beyond the above, we confirm that DBL can be seamlessly integrated into their training scenarios and achieve superior performance under the same computational costs, demonstrating the flexibility and broad applicability of our proposed method. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Paranioar/DBL.</description>

      <title>SafePaint: Anti-forensic Image Inpainting with Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing image inpainting methods have achieved remarkable accomplishments in generating visually appealing results, often accompanied by a trend toward creating more intricate structural textures. However, while these models excel at creating more realistic image content, they often leave noticeable traces of tampering, posing a significant threat to security. In this work, we take the anti-forensic capabilities into consideration, firstly proposing an end-to-end training framework for anti-forensic image inpainting named SafePaint. Specifically, we innovatively formulated image inpainting as two major tasks: semantically plausible content completion and region-wise optimization. The former is similar to current inpainting methods that aim to restore the missing regions of corrupted images. The latter, through domain adaptation, endeavors to reconcile the discrepancies between the inpainted region and the unaltered area to achieve anti-forensic goals. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis, we validate the effectiveness of domain adaptation for anti-forensic performance. Furthermore, we meticulously crafted a region-wise separated attention (RWSA) module, which not only aligns with our objective of anti-forensics but also enhances the performance of the model. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations show our approach achieves comparable results to existing image inpainting methods while offering anti-forensic capabilities not available in other methods.</description>

      <title>Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals. However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>WorldGPT: Empowering LLM as Multimodal World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models are progressively being employed across diverse fields, extending from basic environment simulation to complex scenario construction. However, existing models are mainly trained on domain-specific states and actions, and confined to single-modality state representations. In this paper, We introduce WorldGPT, a generalist world model built upon Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). WorldGPT acquires an understanding of world dynamics through analyzing millions of videos across various domains. To further enhance WorldGPT's capability in specialized scenarios and long-term tasks, we have integrated it with a novel cognitive architecture that combines memory offloading, knowledge retrieval, and context reflection. As for evaluation, we build WorldNet, a multimodal state transition prediction benchmark encompassing varied real-life scenarios. Conducting evaluations on WorldNet directly demonstrates WorldGPT's capability to accurately model state transition patterns, affirming its effectiveness in understanding and predicting the dynamics of complex scenarios. We further explore WorldGPT's emerging potential in serving as a world simulator, helping multimodal agents generalize to unfamiliar domains through efficiently synthesising multimodal instruction instances which are proved to be as reliable as authentic data for fine-tuning purposes. The project is available on \url{https://github.com/DCDmllm/WorldGPT}.</description>

      <title>MM-TTS: A Unified Framework for Multimodal, Prompt-Induced Emotional Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional Text-to-Speech (E-TTS) synthesis has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance human-computer interaction. However, current E-TTS approaches often struggle to capture the complexity of human emotions, primarily relying on oversimplified emotional labels or single-modality inputs. To address these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Emotional Text-to-Speech System (MM-TTS), a unified framework that leverages emotional cues from multiple modalities to generate highly expressive and emotionally resonant speech. MM-TTS consists of two key components: (1) the Emotion Prompt Alignment Module (EP-Align), which employs contrastive learning to align emotional features across text, audio, and visual modalities, ensuring a coherent fusion of multimodal information; and (2) the Emotion Embedding-Induced TTS (EMI-TTS), which integrates the aligned emotional embeddings with state-of-the-art TTS models to synthesize speech that accurately reflects the intended emotions. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MM-TTS compared to traditional E-TTS models. Objective metrics, including Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), show significant improvements on ESD dataset, with MM-TTS achieving scores of 7.35% and 3.07%, respectively. Subjective assessments further validate that MM-TTS generates speech with emotional fidelity and naturalness comparable to human speech. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MMTTS-D214</description>

      <title>UniScene: Multi-Camera Unified Pre-training via 3D Scene Reconstruction for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18829v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-camera 3D perception has emerged as a prominent research field in autonomous driving, offering a viable and cost-effective alternative to LiDAR-based solutions. The existing multi-camera algorithms primarily rely on monocular 2D pre-training. However, the monocular 2D pre-training overlooks the spatial and temporal correlations among the multi-camera system. To address this limitation, we propose the first multi-camera unified pre-training framework, called UniScene, which involves initially reconstructing the 3D scene as the foundational stage and subsequently fine-tuning the model on downstream tasks. Specifically, we employ Occupancy as the general representation for the 3D scene, enabling the model to grasp geometric priors of the surrounding world through pre-training. A significant benefit of UniScene is its capability to utilize a considerable volume of unlabeled image-LiDAR pairs for pre-training purposes. The proposed multi-camera unified pre-training framework demonstrates promising results in key tasks such as multi-camera 3D object detection and surrounding semantic scene completion. When compared to monocular pre-training methods on the nuScenes dataset, UniScene shows a significant improvement of about 2.0% in mAP and 2.0% in NDS for multi-camera 3D object detection, as well as a 3% increase in mIoU for surrounding semantic scene completion. By adopting our unified pre-training method, a 25% reduction in 3D training annotation costs can be achieved, offering significant practical value for the implementation of real-world autonomous driving. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/UniScene.</description>

      <title>Instant3D: Instant Text-to-3D Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has attracted much attention from the computer vision community. Existing methods mainly optimize a neural field from scratch for each text prompt, relying on heavy and repetitive training cost which impedes their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fast text-to-3D generation, dubbed Instant3D. Once trained, Instant3D is able to create a 3D object for an unseen text prompt in less than one second with a single run of a feedforward network. We achieve this remarkable speed by devising a new network that directly constructs a 3D triplane from a text prompt. The core innovation of our Instant3D lies in our exploration of strategies to effectively inject text conditions into the network. In particular, we propose to combine three key mechanisms: cross-attention, style injection, and token-to-plane transformation, which collectively ensure precise alignment of the output with the input text. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective activation function, the scaled-sigmoid, to replace the original sigmoid function, which speeds up the training convergence by more than ten times. Finally, to address the Janus (multi-head) problem in 3D generation, we propose an adaptive Perp-Neg algorithm that can dynamically adjust its concept negation scales according to the severity of the Janus problem during training, effectively reducing the multi-head effect. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving significantly better efficiency. The code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/ming1993li/Instant3DCodes.</description>

      <title>FineFake: A Knowledge-Enriched Dataset for Fine-Grained Multi-Domain Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for fake news detection have significantly contributed to the advancement of models in assessing the authenticity of news content. However, these benchmarks typically focus solely on news pertaining to a single semantic topic or originating from a single platform, thereby failing to capture the diversity of multi-domain news in real scenarios. In order to understand fake news across various domains, the external knowledge and fine-grained annotations are indispensable to provide precise evidence and uncover the diverse underlying strategies for fabrication, which are also ignored by existing benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-domain knowledge-enhanced benchmark with fine-grained annotations, named \textbf{FineFake}. FineFake encompasses 16,909 data samples spanning six semantic topics and eight platforms. Each news item is enriched with multi-modal content, potential social context, semi-manually verified common knowledge, and fine-grained annotations that surpass conventional binary labels. Furthermore, we formulate three challenging tasks based on FineFake and propose a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network. Extensive experiments are conducted on FineFake under various scenarios, providing accurate and reliable benchmarks for future endeavors. The entire FineFake project is publicly accessible as an open-source repository at \url{https://github.com/Accuser907/FineFake}.</description>

      <title>Attack on Scene Flow using Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. Robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants show a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.</description>

      <title>GaussianTalker: Speaker-specific Talking Head Synthesis via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Recent works on audio-driven talking head synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose and expression control caused by NeRF implicit representation, these methods still have some limitations, such as unsynchronized or unnatural lip movements, and visual jitter and artifacts. In this paper, we propose GaussianTalker, a novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation. Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis, delivering precise lip synchronization and exceptional visual quality. Our method achieves rendering speeds of 130 FPS on NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU, significantly exceeding the threshold for real-time rendering performance, and can potentially be deployed on other hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>Every Breath You Don't Take: Deepfake Speech Detection Using Breath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deepfake speech represents a real and growing threat to systems and society. Many detectors have been created to aid in defense against speech deepfakes. While these detectors implement myriad methodologies, many rely on low-level fragments of the speech generation process. We hypothesize that breath, a higher-level part of speech, is a key component of natural speech and thus improper generation in deepfake speech is a performant discriminator. To evaluate this, we create a breath detector and leverage this against a custom dataset of online news article audio to discriminate between real/deepfake speech. Additionally, we make this custom dataset publicly available to facilitate comparison for future work. Applying our simple breath detector as a deepfake speech discriminator on in-the-wild samples allows for accurate classification (perfect 1.0 AUPRC and 0.0 EER on test data) across 33.6 hours of audio. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art SSL-wav2vec model and show that this complex deep learning model completely fails to classify the same in-the-wild samples (0.72 AUPRC and 0.99 EER).</description>
