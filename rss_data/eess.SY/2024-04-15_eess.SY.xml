      <title>Fast Assignment in Asset-Guarding Engagements using Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter considers assignment problems consisting of n pursuers attempting to intercept n targets. We consider stationary targets as well as targets maneuvering toward an asset. The assignment algorithm relies on an n x n cost matrix where entry (i, j) is the minimum time for pursuer i to intercept target j. Each entry of this matrix requires the solution of a nonlinear optimal control problem. This subproblem is computationally intensive and hence the computational cost of the assignment is dominated by the construction of the cost matrix. We propose to use neural networks for function approximation of the minimum time until intercept. The neural networks are trained offline, thus allowing for real-time online construction of cost matrices. Moreover, the function approximators have sufficient accuracy to obtain reasonable solutions to the assignment problem. In most cases, the approximators achieve assignments with optimal worst case intercept time. The proposed approach is demonstrated on several examples with increasing numbers of pursuers and targets.</description>

      <title>Energy-Intensive Industries Providing Ancillary Services: A Real Case of Zinc Galvanizing Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-intensive industries can adapt to help balance the power grid. By using a real-world case study of a zinc galvanizing process in Denmark, we show how a modest investment in power control of the furnace enables the provision of various ancillary services. We consider two types of services, namely frequency containment reserve (FCR) and manual frequency restoration reserve (mFRR), and numerically conclude that the monetary value of both services is significant, such that the pay-back time of investment is potentially within a year. The FCR service provision is more preferable as its impact on the temperature of the zinc is negligible.</description>

      <title>Using Flexibility Envelopes for the Demand-Side Hierarchical Optimization of District Heating Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand-side control of district heating networks is notoriously challenging due to the large number of connected users and the high number of states to be considered. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hierarchical optimization scheme using the flexibility in heating demand provided by the users to improve the performance of the network. This hierarchical scheme relies on a low level controller to calculate the costs for a subsystem over a given set of potential pressure drops for that subsystem. The high level controller then uses these calculated costs to determine the optimal set of pressure drops for every subgraph of the partitioned network. The proposed hierarchical optimization scheme is demonstrated on a representative 20 user district heating network, resulting in a 67\% reduction in bypass mass flow while ensuring all network users stay within 2 \degree C of their desired nominal temperatures.</description>

      <title>A Novel Vision Transformer based Load Profile Analysis using Load Images as Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ViT4LPA, an innovative Vision Transformer (ViT) based approach for Load Profile Analysis (LPA). We transform time-series load profiles into load images. This allows us to leverage the ViT architecture, originally designed for image processing, as a pre-trained image encoder to uncover latent patterns within load data. ViT is pre-trained using an extensive load image dataset, comprising 1M load images derived from smart meter data collected over a two-year period from 2,000 residential users. The training methodology is self-supervised, masked image modeling, wherein masked load images are restored to reveal hidden relationships among image patches. The pre-trained ViT encoder is then applied to various downstream tasks, including the identification of electric vehicle (EV) charging loads and behind-the-meter solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and load disaggregation. Simulation results illustrate ViT4LPA's superior performance compared to existing neural network models in downstream tasks. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the attention weights within the ViT4LPA model to gain insights into its information flow mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Self-Tuning UHF RFID Antenna and Microfluidic Channel for Liquid Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic has been an enabling technology for over a decade, particularly in the field of medical and wearable devices, allowing for the manipulation of small amounts of fluid in confined spaces. Micro-channels can also be used for wireless sensing thanks to the variations in antenna properties when the fluid flows near it. However, up to now, microfluidic channels and sensing antennas have always been designed separately; instead, since the liquid flow and the antenna geometry both contribute to the overall performance, they should be considered simultaneously when optimizing the antenna-microfluidic system. In this paper, the joint design of the antenna and microfluidic channels is investigated for liquid quantification. Self-tuning RFID microchips are exploited to minimize communication degradation due to the increase of lossy liquid amount over the sensing antenna while digitalizing the impedance mismatch itself. To experimentally corroborate the joint design technique, two different geometries are obtained and prototyped starting from a given antenna-microfluidic layout by setting different goals for an optimization function. The two flexible RFID prototypes returned performance in agreement with the simulated ones, achieving a maximum sensitivity of about 20 units of the digital metric per milligram increase of water.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-Based Attitude Stabilization Using Synergistic Hybrid Feedback With Minimal Potential Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust global attitude stabilization problem for a rigid-body system using quaternion-based feedback. We propose a novel synergistic hybrid feedback with the following notable features: (1) It demonstrates central synergism by utilizing a minimal number of potential functions; (2) It ensures consistency with respect to the unit quaternion representation of rigid-body attitude; (3) Its state-feedback laws incorporate a shared action term that steers the system toward the desired attitude. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid feedback method effectively solves the problem at hand and guarantees robust uniform global asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Completion of Complex Tasks via Temporal Logic Trees and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for guaranteeing the completion of complex tasks with cyber-physical systems (CPS). Specifically, we leverage temporal logic trees constructed using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to (1) check for the existence of control policies that complete a specified task and (2) develop a computationally-efficient approach to synthesize the full set of control inputs the CPS can implement in real-time to ensure the task is completed. We show that, by checking the approximation directions of each state set in the temporal logic tree, we can check if the temporal logic tree suffers from the "leaking corner issue," where the intersection of reachable sets yields an incorrect approximation. By ensuring a temporal logic tree has no leaking corners, we know the temporal logic tree correctly verifies the existence of control policies that satisfy the specified task. After confirming the existence of control policies, we show that we can leverage the value functions obtained through Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to efficiently compute the set of control inputs the CPS can implement throughout the deployment time horizon to guarantee the completion of the specified task. Finally, we use a newly released Python toolbox to evaluate the presented approach on a simulated driving task.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Interval MDP for Robust Control Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abstraction of dynamical systems is a powerful tool that enables the design of feedback controllers using a correct-by-design framework. We investigate a novel scheme to obtain data-driven abstractions of discrete-time stochastic processes in terms of richer discrete stochastic models, whose actions lead to nondeterministic transitions over the space of probability measures. The data-driven component of the proposed methodology lies in the fact that we only assume samples from an unknown probability distribution. We also rely on the model of the underlying dynamics to build our abstraction through backward reachability computations. The nondeterminism in the probability space is captured by a collection of Markov Processes, and we identify how this model can improve upon existing abstraction techniques in terms of satisfying temporal properties, such as safety or reach-avoid. The connection between the discrete and the underlying dynamics is made formal through the use of the scenario approach theory. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages and main limitations of the proposed techniques with respect to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Maximal electric power generation from varying ocean waves with LC-tuned reactive PTO force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reactive Power Take Off (PTO) force is the key to maximizing mechanical power absorption and electric power generation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) from ocean waves with variable frequency, but its study is limited due to its difficulty in physical realization. This paper presents a simple yet effective $LC$-tuned WEC that generates a tunable reactive PTO force from tunable inductor $L$ and capacitor $C$ in the WEC. A complete closed loop system model of the WEC is derived first, then three quantitative rules are obtained from analyzing the model. These rules are used to tune the $LC$ network, and hence the reactive PTO force that drives the WEC, to resonate with the input wave force and generate maximal electric power over a range of wave frequencies. Mathematical analysis of the WEC and tuning rules reveals the analytical and quantitative descriptions of the WEC's mechanical power absorption, active and reactive electric power generation and power factor, optimal electric resistance load, and the generator and $LC$ capacity requirements. Simulation results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed WEC and verify the analysis results.</description>

      <title>Numerical Discretization Methods for Linear Quadratic Control Problems with Time Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the numerical discretization methods of the continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems (LQ-OCPs) with time delays. We describe the weight matrices of the LQ-OCPs as differential equations systems, allowing us to derive the discrete equivalent of the continuous-time LQ-OCPs. Three numerical methods are introduced for solving proposed differential equations systems: 1) the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method, 2) the matrix exponential method, and 3) the step-doubling method. We implement a continuous-time model predictive control (CT-MPC) on a simulated cement mill system, and the objective function of the CT-MPC is discretized using the proposed LQ discretization scheme. The closed-loop results indicate that the CT-MPC successfully stabilizes and controls the simulated cement mill system, ensuring the viability and effectiveness of LQ discretization.</description>

      <title>Swing-Up of a Weakly Actuated Double Pendulum via Nonlinear Normal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the nonlinear normal modes spawning from the stable equilibrium of a double pendulum under gravity, and we establish their connection to homoclinic orbits through the unstable upright position as energy increases. This result is exploited to devise an efficient swing-up strategy for a double pendulum with weak, saturating actuators. Our approach involves stabilizing the system onto periodic orbits associated with the nonlinear modes while gradually injecting energy. Since these modes are autonomous system evolutions, the required control effort for stabilization is minimal. Even with actuator limitations of less than 1% of the maximum gravitational torque, the proposed method accomplishes the swing-up of the double pendulum by allowing sufficient time.</description>

      <title>Prescribing Optimal Health-Aware Operation for Urban Air Mobility with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aims to expand existing transportation networks in metropolitan areas by offering short flights either to transport passengers or cargo. Electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft powered by lithium-ion battery packs are considered promising for such applications. Efficient mission planning is cru-cial, maximizing the number of flights per battery charge while ensuring completion even under unforeseen events. As batteries degrade, precise mission planning becomes challenging due to uncertainties in the end-of-discharge prediction. This often leads to adding safety margins, reducing the number or duration of po-tential flights on one battery charge. While predicting the end of discharge can support decision-making, it remains insufficient in case of unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions. This necessitates health-aware real-time control to address any unexpected events and extend the time until the end of charge while taking the current degradation state into account. This paper addresses the joint problem of mission planning and health-aware real-time control of opera-tional parameters to prescriptively control the duration of one discharge cycle of the battery pack. We pro-pose an algorithm that proactively prescribes operational parameters to extend the discharge cycle based on the battery's current health status while optimizing the mission. The proposed deep reinforcement learn-ing algorithm facilitates operational parameter optimization and path planning while accounting for the degradation state, even in the presence of uncertainties. Evaluation of simulated flights of a NASA concep-tual multirotor aircraft model, collected from Hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrates the algo-rithm's near-optimal performance across various operational scenarios, allowing adaptation to changed en-vironmental conditions.</description>

      <title>A least-square method for non-asymptotic identification in linear switching control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on linear system identification in the setting where it is known that the underlying partially-observed linear dynamical system lies within a finite collection of known candidate models. We first consider the problem of identification from a given trajectory, which in this setting reduces to identifying the index of the true model with high probability. We characterize the finite-time sample complexity of this problem by leveraging recent advances in the non-asymptotic analysis of linear least-square methods in the literature. In comparison to the earlier results that assume no prior knowledge of the system, our approach takes advantage of the smaller hypothesis class and leads to the design of a learner with a dimension-free sample complexity bound. Next, we consider the switching control of linear systems, where there is a candidate controller for each of the candidate models and data is collected through interaction of the system with a collection of potentially destabilizing controllers. We develop a dimension-dependent criterion that can detect those destabilizing controllers in finite time. By leveraging these results, we propose a data-driven switching strategy that identifies the unknown parameters of the underlying system. We then provide a non-asymptotic analysis of its performance and discuss its implications on the classical method of estimator-based supervisory control.</description>

Abstract: Object manipulation has been extensively studied in the context of fixed base and mobile manipulators. However, the overactuated locomotion modality employed by snake robots allows for a unique blend of object manipulation through locomotion, referred to as loco-manipulation. The following work presents an optimization approach to solving the loco-manipulation problem based on non-impulsive implicit contact path planning for our snake robot COBRA. We present the mathematical framework and show high-fidelity simulation results and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Neural Network Robustness Assessment in Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant attention given to the robustness assessment of neural networks. Robustness plays a critical role in ensuring reliable operation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in complex and uncertain environments. Deep learning's robustness problem is particularly significant, highlighted by the discovery of adversarial attacks on image classification models. Researchers have dedicated efforts to evaluate robustness in diverse perturbation conditions for image recognition tasks. Robustness assessment encompasses two main techniques: robustness verification/ certification for deliberate adversarial attacks and robustness testing for random data corruptions. In this survey, we present a detailed examination of both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR) in neural network assessment. Analyzing current research papers and standards, we provide an extensive overview of robustness assessment in image recognition. Three essential aspects are analyzed: concepts, metrics, and assessment methods. We investigate the perturbation metrics and range representations used to measure the degree of perturbations on images, as well as the robustness metrics specifically for the robustness conditions of classification models. The strengths and limitations of the existing methods are also discussed, and some potential directions for future research are provided.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based System Identification and Moving Horizon Estimation Using Low-Cost Sensors for a Miniature Car-Like Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an open-source miniature car-like robot with low-cost sensing and a pipeline for optimization-based system identification, state estimation, and control. The overall robotics platform comes at a cost of less than $700 and thus significantly simplifies the verification of advanced algorithms in a realistic setting. We present a modified bicycle model with Pacejka tire forces to model the dynamics of the considered all-wheel drive vehicle and to prevent singularities of the model at low velocities. Furthermore, we provide an optimization-based system identification approach and a moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme. In extensive hardware experiments, we show that the presented system identification approach results in a model with high prediction accuracy, while the MHE results in accurate state estimates. Finally, the overall closed-loop system is shown to perform well even in the presence of sensor failure for limited time intervals. All hardware, firmware, and control and estimation software is released under a BSD 2-clause license to promote widespread adoption and collaboration within the community.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics on signed graphs and graphons: Beyond the piece-wise constant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individual, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <title>Collective Bayesian Decision-Making in a Swarm of Miniaturized Robots for Surface Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot swarms can effectively serve a variety of sensing and inspection applications. Certain inspection tasks require a binary classification decision. This work presents an experimental setup for a surface inspection task based on vibration sensing and studies a Bayesian two-outcome decision-making algorithm in a swarm of miniaturized wheeled robots. The robots are tasked with individually inspecting and collectively classifying a 1mx1m tiled surface consisting of vibrating and non-vibrating tiles based on the majority type of tiles. The robots sense vibrations using onboard IMUs and perform collision avoidance using a set of IR sensors. We develop a simulation and optimization framework leveraging the Webots robotic simulator and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. We consider two existing information sharing strategies and propose a new one that allows the swarm to rapidly reach accurate classification decisions. We first find optimal parameters that allow efficient sampling in simulation and then evaluate our proposed strategy against the two existing ones using 100 randomized simulation and 10 real experiments. We find that our proposed method compels the swarm to make decisions at an accelerated rate, with an improvement of up to 20.52% in mean decision time at only 0.78% loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Multi-System Multivariate Interconnection and Divergence Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying outlier behavior among sensors and subsystems is essential for discovering faults and facilitating diagnostics in large systems. At the same time, exploring large systems with numerous multivariate data sets is challenging. This study presents a lightweight interconnection and divergence discovery mechanism (LIDD) to identify abnormal behavior in multi-system environments. The approach employs a multivariate analysis technique that first estimates the similarity heatmaps among the sensors for each system and then applies information retrieval algorithms to provide relevant multi-level interconnection and discrepancy details. Our experiment on the readout systems of the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach clusters readout systems and their sensors consistent with the expected calorimeter interconnection configurations, while capturing unusual behavior in divergent clusters and estimating their root causes.</description>

      <title>Supervisory Control Theory with Event Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control theory the only interaction mechanism between supervisor and plant is that the supervisor may enable/disable events from the plant and the plant makes a final decision about which of the enabled events is actually taking place. In this paper, the interaction between supervisor and plant is enriched by allowing the supervisor to force specific events (called forcible events) that are allowed to preempt uncontrollable events. A notion of forcible-controllability is defined that captures the interplay between controllability of a supervisor w.r.t. the uncontrollable events provided by a plant in the setting with event forcing. Existence of a maximally permissive, forcibly-controllable, nonblocking supervisor is shown and an algorithm is provided that computes such a supervisor. The approach is illustrated by two small case studies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven stabilization of an oscillating flow with LTI controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents advances towards the data-based control of periodic oscillator flows, from their fully-developed regime to their equilibrium stabilized in closed-loop, with linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers. The proposed approach directly builds upon Leclercq et al. (2019) and provides several improvements for an efficient online implementation, aimed at being applicable in experiments. First, we use input-output data to construct an LTI mean transfer functions of the flow. The model is subsequently used for the design of an LTI controller with Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) synthesis, that is practical to automate online. Then, using the controller in a feedback loop, the flow shifts in phase space and oscillations are damped. The procedure is repeated until equilibrium is reached, by stacking controllers and performing balanced truncation to deal with the increasing order of the compound controller. In this article, we illustrate the method on the classic flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re=100. Care has been taken such that the method may be fully automated and hopefully used as a valuable tool in a forthcoming experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) promises to revolutionize mobility and connectivity, integrating vehicles into a mobile Internet-of-Things (IoT)-oriented wireless sensor network (WSN). 5G technologies and mobile edge computing further support this vision by facilitating real-time connectivity and empowering massive access to the Internet. In this context, IoT-oriented WSNs play a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems, offering affordable alternatives for traffic monitoring and management. This paper's contribution is twofold: (i) surveying state-of-the-art model-based techniques for efficient sensor selection in traffic flow monitoring, emphasizing challenges of sensor placement; and (ii) advocating for data-driven methodologies to enhance sensor deployment efficacy and traffic modeling accuracy. Further considerations underscore the importance of data-driven approaches for adaptive transportation systems aligned with the IoV paradigm.</description>

      <title>On-line Motion Planning Using Bernstein Polynomials for Enhanced Target Localization in Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of autonomous vehicles for target localization in modern applications has emphasized their superior efficiency, improved safety, and cost advantages over human-operated methods. For localization tasks, autonomous vehicles can be used to increase efficiency and ensure that the target is localized as quickly and precisely as possible. However, devising a motion planning scheme to achieve these objectives in a computationally efficient manner suitable for real-time implementation is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce a motion planning solution for enhanced target localization, leveraging Bernstein polynomial basis functions to approximate the probability distribution of the target's trajectory. This allows us to derive estimation performance criteria which are used by the motion planner to enhance the estimator efficacy. To conclude, we present simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm.</description>

      <title>Load Shifting Versus Manual Frequency Reserve: Which One is More Appealing to Flexible Loads?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how a thermostatically controlled load can deliver flexibility either in form of manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR) or load shifting, and which one is financially more appealing to such a load. A supermarket freezer is considered as a representative flexible load, and a grey-box model describing its temperature dynamics is developed using real data from a supermarket in Denmark. Taking into account price and activation uncertainties, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program is formulated to maximize the flexibility value from the freezer. For practical reasons, we propose a linear policy to determine regulating power bids, and then linearize the mFRR activation conditions through the McCormick relaxation approach. For computational ease, we develop a decomposition technique, splitting the problem to a set of smaller subproblems, one per scenario. Examined on an out-of-sample simulation based on real Danish spot and balancing market prices in 2022, load shifting shows to be more profitable than mFRR provision, but is also more consequential for temperature deviations in the freezer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic control of greenhouse crop production is of great interest owing to the increasing energy and labor costs. In this work, we use two-level control, where the upper level generates suitable reference trajectories for states and control inputs based on day-ahead predictions. These references are tracked in the lower level using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). In order to apply NMPC, a model of the greenhouse dynamics is essential. However, the complex nature of the underlying model including discontinuities and nonlinearities results in intractable computational complexity and long sampling times. As a remedy, we employ NMPC as a data generator to learn the tracking control policy using deep neural networks. Then, the references are tracked using the trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) to reduce the computational burden. The efficiency of our approach under real-time disturbances is demonstrated by means of a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Neural-Fly Enables Rapid Learning for Agile Flight in Strong Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Executing safe and precise flight maneuvers in dynamic high-speed winds is important for the ongoing commoditization of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in different wind conditions share a common representation and that the wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12 minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to 43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight control with substantially smaller tracking error than state-of-the-art nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can transfer across drones with minimal performance degradation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models ((M)LLMs) has ushered in new avenues in artificial intelligence, particularly for autonomous driving by offering enhanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces LimSim++, an extended version of LimSim designed for the application of (M)LLMs in autonomous driving. Acknowledging the limitations of existing simulation platforms, LimSim++ addresses the need for a long-term closed-loop infrastructure supporting continuous learning and improved generalization in autonomous driving. The platform offers extended-duration, multi-scenario simulations, providing crucial information for (M)LLM-driven vehicles. Users can engage in prompt engineering, model evaluation, and framework enhancement, making LimSim++ a versatile tool for research and practice. This paper additionally introduces a baseline (M)LLM-driven framework, systematically validated through quantitative experiments across diverse scenarios. The open-source resources of LimSim++ are available at: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/limsim-plus/.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>
