      <title>A Formalization of Elementary Linear Algebra: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first installment of an exposition of an ACL2 formalization of elementary linear algebra, focusing on aspects of the subject that apply to matrices over an arbitrary commutative ring with identity, in anticipation of a future treatment of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, which has entries in a polyniomial ring.  The main contribution of this paper is a formal theory of the determinant, including its characterization as the unique alternating n-linear function of the rows of an non matrix, multiplicativity of the determinant, and the correctness of cofactor expansion.

      <description>arXiv:2507.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second installment of an exposition of an ACL2 formalization of elementary linear algebra.  It extends the results of Part I, which covers the algebra of matrices over a commutative ring, but focuses on aspects of the theory that apply only to matrices over a field: elementary row reduction and its application to the computation of matrix inverses and the solution of simultaneous systems of linear equations.

      <title>Regular $K_3$-irregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem proposed by Chartrand, Erd\H{o}s and Oellermann (1988) about the existence of regular $K_3$-irregular graphs. We first establish bounds on the $K_3$-degrees of such graphs and use them to prove that there are no such graphs with regularities at most $7$. For the regularity $8$, we narrow down the bounds on the order of such graphs to six possible values. We then present an explicit example of a $9$-regular $K_3$-irregular graph. Finally, we discuss an evolutionary algorithm developed to discover more examples of $r$-regular $K_3$-irregular graphs for consecutive values $r \in \{9, \dots, 30\}$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing entropy for power-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A power-free language is characterized by the number of symbols used and a limit on how many times a block of symbols can repeat consecutively. For certain values of these parameters, it is known that the number of legal words grows exponentially fast with respect to length. In the terminology of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, this means that the corresponding shift space has positive topological entropy.
  We prove that in many cases, this shift space has a unique measure of maximal entropy. The proof uses a weak analogue of Bowen's specification property. The lack of any periodic points in power-free shift spaces stands in striking contrast to other applications of specification-based techniques, where the number of periodic points often has exponential growth rate given by the topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Largest planar graphs of diameter $3$ and fixed maximum degree -- connection with fractional matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree diameter problem asks for the maximum possible number of vertices in a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and diameter $D$. In this paper, we focus on planar graphs of diameter $3$. Fellows, Hell and Seyffarth (1995) proved that for all $\Delta\geq 8$, the maximum number $\mathrm{np}_{\Delta, D}$ of vertices of a planar graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and diameter at most 3 satisfies $\frac{9}{2}\Delta - 3 \leq \mathrm{np}_{\Delta,3} \leq 8 \Delta + 12$. We show that the lower bound they gave is optimal, up to an additive constant, by proving that there exists $c&gt;0$ such that $\mathrm{np}_{\Delta,3} \leq \frac{9}{2}\Delta + c$ for every $\Delta\geq 0$. Our proof consists in a reduction to the fractional maximum matching problem on a specific class of planar graphs, for which we show that the optimal solution is $\tfrac{9}{2}$, and characterize all graphs attaining this bound.</description>

      <title>A Truly Subcubic Combinatorial Algorithm for Induced 4-Cycle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first truly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for detecting an induced $4$-cycle in a graph. The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node graphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting triangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular BMM hypothesis.
  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of induced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of various sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle detection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the lowest level of the classification, dubbing it a "curious" case [Dalirrooyfard, Vassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of this question.
  Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph detection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that has hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander decompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in the application of graph regularity lemmas). While our algorithm is slower than the (non-combinatorial) state-of-the-art $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$-time algorithm based on polynomial identity testing [Vassilevska W., Wang, Williams, Yu, SODA 2014], combinatorial advancements often come with other benefits. In particular, we give the first nontrivial deterministic algorithm for detecting induced $4$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Edge-coloring problems with forbidden patterns and planted colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-coloring problems with forbidden patterns refer to decision problems whose input is a graph $\mathbb G$ and where the goal is to determine whether the edges of $\mathbb G$ can be colored (with a fixed finite set of colors) in a way that in the resulting colored graph $(\mathbb G, \xi)$, none of a fixed set of edge-colored obstructions admits a homomorphism to $(\mathbb G, \xi)$. In the coloring extension setting, some of the edges of $\mathbb G$ are already colored and the goal is to find an extension of this coloring omitting the obstructions. We show that for certain sets of obstructions, there is a polynomial-time equivalence between the coloring problem and the extension problem. We also show that for natural sets of obstructions, such coloring problems exhibit a P vs. NP-complete complexity dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Bespoke multiresolution analysis of graph signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets, and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction. We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation, we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>

      <title>Sequence of Numbers of Linear Codes with Increasing Hull Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hull of a linear code $C$ is the intersection of $C$ with its dual code. We present and analyze the number of linear $q$-ary codes of the same length and dimension but with different dimensions for their hulls. We prove that for given dimension $k$ and length $n\ge 2k$ the number of all $[n,k]_q$ linear codes with hull dimension $l$ decreases as $l$ increases. We also present classification results for binary and ternary linear codes with trivial hulls (LCD and self-orthogonal) for some values of the length $n$ and dimension $k$, comparing the obtained numbers with the number of all linear codes for the given $n$ and $k$.</description>
