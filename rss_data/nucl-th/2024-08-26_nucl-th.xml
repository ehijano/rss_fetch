      <title>Refining the isovector component of the Woods-Saxon potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the isovector component in the phenomenological mean field model of nuclei. Lane's isospin dependence, initially proposed for the nuclear optical potential, is reexamined within the context of bound states using the Woods-Saxon potential. We demonstrate that the original parametrization can be reexpressed in terms of parameters associated with the compound nucleus, enhancing its suitability for bound states. Comparisons with the conventional symmetry term are performed to assess how well each approach fits experimental data on single-particle/hole energies and reproduces charge-radius systematics. Our results indicate that Lane's formula provides better accuracy compared with the traditional approach to the nuclear potential. Additionally, we find that the isovector component of the nuclear potential favors a surface-peaked form factor, especially one described by the first derivative of the Fermi like function divided by the radial coordinate. This consideration is crucial for open-shell nuclei where Woods-Saxon eigenfunctions serve as a realistic basis for other many-body methods. Our findings also enable discrimination among various shell-model calculations of the isospin-symmetry breaking correction to superallowed $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ nuclear $\beta$ decays [I.~S. Towner and J.~C. Hardy, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 77}, 025501 (2008)]. This disparity currently constitutes the main source of theoretical uncertainty in subsequent tests of the standard model.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic equation of state with a momentum dependent interaction and neutron star structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of free quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.</description>

      <title>Global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of nuclear low-lying states and double-beta decay with a covariant energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of nuclear low-lying states within the framework of multireference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT) using a relativistic point-coupling energy density functional (EDF). This study is made possible by the newly developed subspace-projected (SP)-CDFT, where the wave functions of nuclear low-lying states for target EDF parameter sets are expanded in a subspace spanned by the wave functions of low-lying states from training parameter sets. We analyze the global sensitivity of excitation energies, electric quadrupole transition strengths, and the nuclear matrix element of neutrinoless double-beta decay in $^{136}$Xe and $^{150}$Nd to EDF parameters, and explore the correlations between these quantities and nuclear matter properties. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical uncertainty of low-lying states through their posterior distributions.</description>

      <title>Spatial imaging of polarized deuterons at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffractive vector meson production at small-$x$ in the collision of electrons and polarized deuterons $e+d^{\uparrow}$. We consider the polarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which results in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when the deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section exhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized deuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius provides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave function. Furthermore, we observe slightly increased gluon saturation effects when the deuteron is longitudinally polarized compared to the transversely polarized case. The small-$x$ observables studied in this work will be accessible at the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Variational inference of effective range parameters for ${}^3$He-${}^4$He scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use two different methods, Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference (VI), to perform a Bayesian calibration of the effective-range parameters in ${}^3$He-${}^4$He elastic scattering. The parameters are calibrated to data from a recent set of $^{3}$He-${}^4$He elastic scattering differential cross section measurements. Analysis of these data for $E_{\rm lab} \leq 4.3$ MeV yields a unimodal posterior for which both methods obtain the same structure. However, the effective-range expansion amplitude does not account for the $7/2^-$ state of ${}^7$Be so, even after calibration, the description of data at the upper end of this energy range is poor. The data up to $E_{\rm lab}=2.6$ MeV can be well described, but calibration to this lower-energy subset of the data yields a bimodal posterior. After adapting VI to treat such a multi-modal posterior we find good agreement between the VI results and those obtained with parallel-tempered Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <title>Vertex correction to nuclear matrix elements of double-$\beta$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predicted neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay is the crucial phenomenon to prove the existence of the Majorana neutrino, which gives a foundation to leptogenesis to explain the matter prevalence of the universe. The nuclear matrix element (NME) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay is an important theoretical quantity to determine the effective neutrino mass and help the detector design for the next generation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search. Reliable calculation of this NME is a long-standing problem because of the diversity of the predicted values of the NME. The main reason for this difficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition operator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex corrections for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe in the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the leptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The unperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation. These corrections reduce the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME by 30%. The effective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown for the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is not quite different from that for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME; the difference is only 10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$ to reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay can be approximately used for the calculation of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-$p$ bound state and completeness of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a bound state of a $\phi$ meson and proton has been recently indicated on the basis of a combined analysis of the measured $\phi$-$p$ correlation function and the QCD lattice calculations of $\phi$-$p$ interaction in the spin 1/2 and 3/2 channels. We check whether the correlation functions and bound state formation rate satisfy the sum rule which follows from the completeness of quantum states. The sum rule is not satisfied but it is close to it, suggesting that the inferred scattering parameters, which determine the correlation functions, are not fully consistent with the potential responsible for the bound state existence.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark diffusion in 2+1D and Glasma-like plasmas: evidence of a transport peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how plasma excitations affect the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in 2+1 dimensional and Glasma-like plasmas, akin to the pre-equilibrium matter describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions at early times. We find that the transport coefficient $2\kappa$ transverse to and $\kappa_z$ along the beam direction display a qualitatively different evolution. We attribute this to the underlying excitation spectra of these systems, thus providing evidence for the existence of non-perturbative properties in the spectrum. This is accomplished by first reconstructing the diffusion coefficients using gauge-fixed correlation functions, which accurately reproduces the time evolution of $2\kappa$ and $\kappa_z$. We then modify these excitation spectra to study the impact of their non-perturbative features on the transport coefficients. In particular, we find evidence for a novel transport peak in the low-frequency spectrum that is crucial for heavy-quark diffusion. We also demonstrate that gluonic excitations are broad while scalar excitations associated with $\kappa_z$ are narrow and strongly enhanced at low momenta. Our findings indicate that the large values and dynamical properties of transport coefficients in the Glasma could originate from genuinely non-perturbative features in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Search for the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$ decay by triangle singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the resonance production in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$ decay through the triangle singularity (TS) mechanism, within an effective Lagrangian approach. We find that the appropriate loop decay process could develop a triangle singularity in the invariant mass $M_{\pi\Lambda}$ around $1.35$ GeV, with the shape depending on the quantum numbers of $\Sigma^*$ states that couple to the final $\pi\Lambda$ system. Especially, the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state newly predicted in the pentaquark model, if exists, significantly enhances the TS contribution and sharpens the TS peak due to the $S$-wave $\Sigma^*\pi\Sigma$ vertex in the loop. Therefore, the existence of the $\Sigma(1380)1/2^-$ state can be examined by measuring the TS signal in $\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda$. Considering also possible tree-level diagrams, we additionally obtain the branching ratio ${\rm Br}(\Lambda^+_c \to \gamma \pi^+ \Lambda)\simeq 1.5\times 10^{-5}$. We suggest the investigation of this reaction by future BESIII, LHCb, and Belle experiments.</description>

      <title>Generating ultra-compact neutron stars with bosonic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.</description>

      <title>Ab initio leading order effective potential for elastic proton scattering based on the symmetry-adapted no-core shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the Watson expansion of the multiple scattering series, we employ a nonlocal translationally invariant nuclear density derived within the symmetry-adapted no-core shell model (SA-NCSM) framework from a chiral next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) nucleon-nucleon interaction and the very same interaction for a consistent full-folding calculation of the effective (optical) potential for nucleon-nucleus scattering for medium-heavy nuclei. The leading order effective (optical) folding potential is computed by integrating over a translationally invariant SA-NCSM one-body scalar density, spin-projected momentum distribution, and the Wolfenstein amplitudes $A$, $C$, and $M$. The resulting nonlocal potentials serve as input for a momentum space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, whose solutions are summed up to obtain nucleon-nucleus scattering observables. In the SA-NCSM, the model space is systematically up-selected using $\SpR{3}$ symmetry considerations. For the light nucleus of $^6$He, we establish a systematic selection scheme in the SA-NCSM for scattering observables. Then, we apply this scheme to calculations of scattering observables, such as differential cross sections, analyzing powers, and spin rotation functions for elastic proton scattering from $^{20}$Ne and $^{40}$Ca in the energy regime between 65 and 200 MeV, and compare to available data. Our calculations show that the leading order effective nucleon-nucleus potential in the Watson expansion of multiple scattering theory obtained from an up-selected SA-NCSM model space describes $^{40}$Ca elastic scattering observables reasonably well to about 60 degrees in the center-of-mass frame, which coincides roughly with the validity of the NNLO chiral interaction used to calculate both the nucleon-nucleon amplitudes and the one-body scalar and spin nuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Inter-band B(E1) Strengths in Heavy Nuclei based on the Proxy-SU(3) Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational bands of positive and negative parity are frequently found experimentally in heavy deformed even-even nuclei along with their corresponding $E2$ intra-band and $E1$ inter-band transitions. In $SU(3)$ symmetry-based models, calculating the $B(E2)$ strengths is relatively straightforward due to the relation between the $E2$ operator and the quadrupole generator of the algebra. However, calculating the $B(E1)$ strengths is a more difficult task, requiring computations involving the shell-model expansion of the dipole operator and multi-shell matrix elements. In this work the $E1$ operator is expanded in $SU(3)$ second quantization and applied to calculate the inter-band $B(E1)$ strengths of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the recently proposed proxy-$SU(3)$ scheme.</description>

Abstract: The Short-Time approximation is a method introduced to evaluate electroweak nuclear response for systems with $A\geq12$, extending the reach of first-principle many-body Quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Using realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions and consistent one- and two-body electromagnetic currents, we calculate longitudinal and transverse response densities and response functions of $^{12}\text{C}$. We compare the resulting cross sections with experimental data for electron-nucleus scattering, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole-Octupole Residual Interaction in the Proxy-$SU(3)$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The octupole deformation of atomic nuclei is a relevant research area given its implications in the nuclear structure and fundamental physics, however, inclusion of octupole degrees of freedom in the nuclear interaction has been explored little in $SU(3)$ symmetry-based models. In this article we expand the octupole operator $\mathcal{O}^3_\mu$ in the $SU(3)$ second quantization formalism and use it to formulate an octupole-octupole residual interaction $\mathcal{O}^3\cdot \mathcal{O}^3$ which is incorporated in Elliott's model Hamiltonian. We compute the matrix elements of this extended Hamiltonian and use them to calculate energy levels and analyse the $B(E3; 3^-_1\rightarrow 0^+_1)$ transition strength of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the proxy-$SU(3)$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Study of the effects of external imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential on quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider. In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach with $N_f=1+1$ dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. In addition to this, we find that the behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not significantly affected by chiral chemical potential in the region of the parameters consider in this paper.</description>

      <title>Minijet quenching in non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy deposition and thermalisation of high-momentum on-shell partons (minijets) travelling through a non-equilibrium Quark-Gluon Plasma using QCD kinetic theory. For thermal backgrounds, we show that the parton energy first flows to the soft sector by collinear cascade and then isotropises via elastic scatterings. In contrast, the momentum deposition from a minijet reaches the equilibrium distribution directly. For expanding non-equilibrium QGP, we study the time for a minijet perturbation to lose memory of its initial conditions, namely, the hydrodynamisation time. We show that the minijet evolution scales well with the relaxation time ${\tau}_R \propto {\eta}/s/T ({\tau} )$, where $T ({\tau} )$ is the effective temperature and ${\eta}/s$ is the viscosity over entropy ratio.</description>
