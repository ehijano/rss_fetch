      <title>Game-theoretic Distributed Learning Approach for Heterogeneous-cost Task Allocation with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates heterogeneous-cost task allocation with budget constraints (HCTAB), wherein heterogeneity is manifested through the varying capabilities and costs associated with different agents for task execution. Different from the centralized optimization-based method, the HCTAB problem is solved using a fully distributed framework, and a coalition formation game is introduced to provide a theoretical guarantee for this distributed framework. To solve the coalition formation game, a convergence-guaranteed log-linear learning algorithm based on heterogeneous cost is proposed. This algorithm incorporates two improvement strategies, namely, a cooperative exchange strategy and a heterogeneous-cost log-linear learning strategy. These strategies are specifically designed to be compatible with the heterogeneous cost and budget constraints characteristic of the HCTAB problem. Through ablation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these two improvements. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing task allocation algorithms and learning algorithms in terms of solving the HCTAB problem.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for School Assignment: Group Fairness and Multi-criteria Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15623v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning students to schools, when students have different utilities for schools and schools have capacity. There are additional group fairness considerations over students that can be captured either by concave objectives, or additional constraints on the groups. We present approximation algorithms for this problem via convex program rounding that achieve various trade-offs between utility violation, capacity violation, and running time. We also show that our techniques easily extend to the setting where there are arbitrary covering constraints on the feasible assignment, capturing multi-criteria and ranking optimization.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Coalitions between EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastructure globally. This expansion, however, places significant charging demand on the electricity grid, impacting grid operations and electricity pricing. While coordination among all charging stations is beneficial, it may not be always feasible. However, a subset of charging stations, which could be jointly operated by a company, could coordinate to decide their charging profile. In this paper we investigate whether such coalitions between charging stations is better than no coordination.
  We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station's cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a nominal charging profile. We consider a solution concept that we call $\mathcal{C}$-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition $\mathcal{C}$ of charging stations coordinating to reduce their cumulative costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity of charging stations, to determine when independent (uncoordinated) operation of charging stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, the coalition, and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to intuition, we demonstrate scenarios where allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating as a coalition. Jointly, these results provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinate their charging behavior, and open several research directions.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Cyber Resilience: The Confluence of Game, Control, and Learning Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyber resilience is a complementary concept to cybersecurity, focusing on the preparation, response, and recovery from cyber threats that are challenging to prevent. Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</description>
