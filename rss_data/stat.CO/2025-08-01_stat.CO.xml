      <title>Efficient inference of dynamic gene regulatory networks using discrete penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) orchestrate cellular decision making and survival strategies. Inferring the structure of these networks from high-dimensional transcriptomics data is a central challenge in systems biology. Traditional approaches to GRN inference, such as the graphical lasso and its joint extensions, rely on $\ell_1$ penalty to induce sparsity but can bias network recovery and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. Here, we present a scalable framework for the joint inference of dynamic GRNs using a discrete $\ell_0$ penalty, enabling direct and unbiased control over network sparsity. Leveraging recent algorithmic advances, we efficiently solve the resulting mixed-integer optimization problem for populations structured as arbitrary tree hypergraphs, accommodating both continuous and categorical distinctions among biological samples. After validating our method on synthetic benchmarks, we apply it to single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data from glioblastoma (GBM) patient tumors. Our approach reconstructs gene networks across tumor clusters, maps network rewiring along hypoxia gradients, and reveals niche-specific differences between primary and recurrent tumors. By providing a robust and interpretable tool for GRN inference in complex tissues, our work facilitates high-resolution dissection of tumor heterogeneity and adaptation, with broad applicability to emerging large-scale transcriptomic datasets.</description>

      <title>A-optimal Designs under Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize and identify A-optimal designs under generalized linear models. When a predetermined finite set of experimental settings is given, we derive analytic solutions or establish necessary and sufficient conditions for obtaining A-optimal approximate allocations. We show that a lift-one algorithm based on our formulae may outperform commonly used algorithms for finding A-optimal allocations. When continuous factors or design regions get involved, we develop a ForLion algorithm that is guaranteed to find A-optimal designs with mixed factors. Numerical studies show that our algorithms are able to find highly efficient designs with reduced numbers of distinct experimental settings, which may save both experimental time and cost significantly. Along with a rounding-off algorithm that converts approximate allocations to exact ones, we demonstrate that stratified samplers based on A-optimal allocations may provide more accurate parameter estimates than commonly used samplers, including D-optimal ones.</description>
