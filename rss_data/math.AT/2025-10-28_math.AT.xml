      <title>N^d-indexed persistence modules, higher dimensional partitions and rank invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules via higher dimensional partitions. Their barcodes are defined in terms of the extended interior of the corresponding Young diagrams. For two decomposable N^d-indexed persistence modules, we present a necessary and sufficient condition, in terms of the partitions, for their rank invariants to be the same. This generalizes the well-known fact that for an N-indexed persistence module, its barcode and its rank invariant determine each other, i.e., the rank invariant is a complete invariant.</description>

      <title>The Goresky-Hingston Coproduct on Based Loop Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a lift of the Goresky-Hingston coproduct on the based loop space. Using this lift, we produce formulas for the interaction of the coproduct with the $\pi_1$-action and with maps of manifolds. These results lets us compute the coproduct on the based loop space for manifolds of the form $S^n/G$.</description>

      <title>The Goresky-Hingston Coproduct in Morse Homology with DG Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the Goresky-Hingston coproduct on the free loop space with real coefficients via the quasi-isomorphism $C_*(\Lambda M)\simeq C_*(M,C_*(\Omega M))$. This lets us describe the coproduct on the Leray-Serre spectral sequence as the diagonal on the manifold and the coproduct on the based loop space. With this description, we compute the coproduct with real coefficients for manifolds of the form $M=S^n/G$. The appendix contains results on inverting morphisms of $\mathcal{A}_\infty$-modules that are required for our computations.</description>

      <title>Segal models for equivariant incomplete infinite loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model equivariant infinite loop spaces indexed on incomplete universes via suitable equivariant analogs of $\Gamma$-spaces. The choice of universe dictates a transfer system which in turn dictates the Segal condition on equivariant $\Gamma$-spaces. Equivariant $\Gamma$-spaces themselves come in different but equivalent guises interpolating between categories $\Gamma$ as defined by Segal and $\Gamma_G$ as defined by Shimakawa. The main application is the construction of Segal $K$-theory of normed permutative categories.</description>

      <title>Through the Grapevine: Vineyard Distance as a Measure of Topological Dissimilarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure of distance between datasets, based on vineyards from topological data analysis, which we call the vineyard distance. Vineyard distance measures the extent of topological change along an interpolation from one dataset to another, either along a pre-computed trajectory or via a straight-line homotopy. We demonstrate through theoretical results and experiments that vineyard distance is less sensitive than $L^p$ distance (which considers every single data value), but more sensitive than Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams (which accounts only for shape and not location). This allows vineyard distance to reveal distinctions that the other two distance measures cannot. In our paper, we establish theoretical results for vineyard distance including as upper and lower bounds. We then demonstrate the usefulness of vineyard distance on real-world data through applications to geospatial data and to neural network training dynamics.</description>

      <title>Self-covering, finiteness, commutativity, and fibering over tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological space is called self-covering if it is a nontrivial cover of itself. We prove that, under mild assumptions, a closed self-covering manifold with an abelian fundamental group fibers over a torus in various senses. As a corollary, if its dimension is above $5$ and its fundamental group is free abelian, then it is a fiber bundle over a circle. We also construct non-fibering examples when these assumptions are not fulfilled. In particular, one class of examples illustrates that the structure of self-covering manifolds is more complicated when the fundamental groups are nonabelian, and the corresponding fibering problem encounters significant difficulties.</description>

      <title>Duality in tensor-triangular geometry via proxy-smallness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make a systematic study of duality phenomena in tensor-triangular geometry, generalising and complementing previous results of Balmer--Dell'Ambrogio--Sanders and Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar. A key feature of our approach is the use of proxy-smallness to remove assumptions on functors preserving compact objects, and to this end we introduce proxy-small geometric functors and establish their key properties. Given such a functor, we classify the rigid objects in its associated torsion category, giving a new perspective on results of Benson--Iyengar--Krause--Pevtsova. As a consequence, we show that any proxy-small geometric functor satisfies Grothendieck duality on a canonical subcategory of objects, irrespective of whether its right adjoint preserves compact objects. We use this as a tool to classify Matlis dualising objects and to provide a suitable generalisation of the Gorenstein ring spectra of Dwyer--Greenlees--Iyengar in tensor-triangular geometry. We illustrate the framework developed with various examples and applications, showing that it captures Matlis duality and Gorenstein duality in commutative algebra, duality phenomena in chromatic and equivariant stable homotopy theory, and Watanabe's theorem in polynomial invariant theory.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fibrations in Higher Topos Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to put the theory of approximate fibrations into the framework of higher topos theory. We define the notion of an approximate fibration for a general geometric morphism of $\infty$-topoi, give several characterizations in terms of shape theory and compare it to the original definition for maps of topological spaces of Coram and Duvall. Furthermore, we revisit the notion of cell-like maps between topoi, and generalize Lurie's shape-theoretic characterization by giving a purely topos-theoretical proof.</description>

      <title>Topological complexity of oriented Grassmann manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb Z_2$-zero-divisor cup-length, denoted by $\operatorname{zcl}_{\mathbb Z_2}(\widetilde G_{n,3})$, of the Grassmann manifolds $\widetilde G_{n,3}$ of oriented $3$-dimensional vector subspaces in $\mathbb R^n$. Some lower and upper bounds for this invariant are obtained for all integers $n\ge6$. For infinitely many of them the exact value of $\operatorname{zcl}_{\mathbb Z_2}(\widetilde G_{n,3})$ is computed, and in the rest of the cases these bounds differ by 1. We thus establish lower bounds for the topological complexity of Grassmannians $\widetilde G_{n,3}$.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Rips: Stable Multiparameter Filtrations of Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the monoidal Rips filtration, a filtered simplicial set for weighted directed graphs and other lattice-valued networks. Our construction generalizes the Vietoris-Rips filtration for metric spaces by replacing the maximum operator, determining the filtration values, with a more general monoidal product. We establish interleaving guarantees for the monoidal Rips persistent homology, capturing existing stability results for real-valued networks. When the lattice is a product of totally ordered sets, we are in the setting of multiparameter persistence. Here, the interleaving distance is bounded in terms of a generalized network distance. We use this to prove a novel stability result for the sublevel Rips bifiltration. Our experimental results show that our method performs better than Flagser in a graph regression task, and that combining different monoidal products in point cloud classification can improve performance.</description>

      <title>Pre-Lie algebras up to homotopy with divided powers and homotopy of operadic mapping spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this memoir is to study pre-Lie algebras up to homotopy with divided powers, and to use this algebraic structure for the study of mapping spaces in the category of operads. We define a new notion of algebra called $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebra which characterizes the notion of $\Gamma(\mathcal{P}re\mathcal{L}ie_\infty,-)$-algebra. We also define a notion of a Maurer-Cartan element in complete $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebras which generalizes the classical definition in Lie algebras. We prove that for every complete brace algebra $A$, and for every $n\geq 0$, the tensor product $A\otimes\Sigma N^*(\Delta^n)$ is endowed with the structure of a complete $\Gamma\Lambda\mathcal{PL}_\infty$-algebra, and define the simplicial Maurer-Cartan set $\mathcal{MC}_\bullet(A)$ associated to $A$ as the Maurer-Cartan set of $ A\otimes\Sigma N^*(\Delta^\bullet)$. We compute the homotopy groups of this simplicial set, and prove that the functor $\mathcal{MC}_\bullet(-)$ satisfies a homotopy invariance result, which extends the Goldman-Millson theorem in dimension $0$. As an application, we give a description of mapping spaces in the category of non-symmetric operads in terms of this simplicial Maurer-Cartan set. We etablish a generalization of the latter result for symmetric operads.</description>

Abstract: We show a criterion for a skeleton of a manifold triangulation being embeddable into Euclidean space in terms of the complement of a submanifold. As an application, we obtain embeddability of a $(q-1)$-skeleton of a triangulation of an $S^p$-bundle over $S^q$ into $\mathbb{R}^{p+q}$.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>
