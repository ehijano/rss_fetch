      <title>Toward Efficient Deep Blind RAW Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple low-vision tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution depart from RGB images and further reduce the degradations, improving the quality. However, modeling the degradations in the sRGB domain is complicated because of the Image Signal Processor (ISP) transformations. Despite of this known issue, very few methods in the literature work directly with sensor RAW images. In this work we tackle image restoration directly in the RAW domain. We design a new realistic degradation pipeline for training deep blind RAW restoration models. Our pipeline considers realistic sensor noise, motion blur, camera shake, and other common degradations. The models trained with our pipeline and data from multiple sensors, can successfully reduce noise and blur, and recover details in RAW images captured from different cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most exhaustive analysis on RAW image restoration. Code available at https://github.com/mv-lab/AISP</description>

      <title>PNR: Physics-informed Neural Representation for high-resolution LFM reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has been widely utilized in various fields for its capability to efficiently capture high-resolution 3D scenes. Despite the rapid advancements in neural representations, there are few methods specifically tailored for microscopic scenes. Existing approaches often do not adequately address issues such as the loss of high-frequency information due to defocus and sample aberration, resulting in suboptimal performance. In addition, existing methods, including RLD, INR, and supervised U-Net, face challenges such as sensitivity to initial estimates, reliance on extensive labeled data, and low computational efficiency, all of which significantly diminish the practicality in complex biological scenarios. This paper introduces PNR (Physics-informed Neural Representation), a method for high-resolution LFM reconstruction that significantly enhances performance. Our method incorporates an unsupervised and explicit feature representation approach, resulting in a 6.1 dB improvement in PSNR than RLD. Additionally, our method employs a frequency-based training loss, enabling better recovery of high-frequency details, which leads to a reduction in LPIPS by at least half compared to SOTA methods (1.762 V.S. 3.646 of DINER). Moreover, PNR integrates a physics-informed aberration correction strategy that optimizes Zernike polynomial parameters during optimization, thereby reducing the information loss caused by aberrations and improving spatial resolution. These advancements make PNR a promising solution for long-term high-resolution biological imaging applications. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>PDFed: Privacy-Preserving and Decentralized Asynchronous Federated Learning for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PDFed, a decentralized, aggregator-free, and asynchronous federated learning protocol for training image diffusion models using a public blockchain. In general, diffusion models are prone to memorization of training data, raising privacy and ethical concerns (e.g., regurgitation of private training data in generated images). Federated learning (FL) offers a partial solution via collaborative model training across distributed nodes that safeguard local data privacy. PDFed proposes a novel sample-based score that measures the novelty and quality of generated samples, incorporating these into a blockchain-based federated learning protocol that we show reduces private data memorization in the collaboratively trained model. In addition, PDFed enables asynchronous collaboration among participants with varying hardware capabilities, facilitating broader participation. The protocol records the provenance of AI models, improving transparency and auditability, while also considering automated incentive and reward mechanisms for participants. PDFed aims to empower artists and creators by protecting the privacy of creative works and enabling decentralized, peer-to-peer collaboration. The protocol positively impacts the creative economy by opening up novel revenue streams and fostering innovative ways for artists to benefit from their contributions to the AI space.</description>

      <title>Developing a Dual-Stage Vision Transformer Model for Lung Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung diseases have become a prevalent problem throughout the United States, affecting over 34 million people. Accurate and timely diagnosis of the different types of lung diseases is critical, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods could speed up these processes. A dual-stage vision transformer is built throughout this research by integrating a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Swin Transformer to classify 14 different lung diseases from X-ray scans of patients with these diseases. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 92.06\% when making predictions on an unseen testing subset of the dataset after data preprocessing and training the neural network. The model showed promise for accurately classifying lung diseases and diagnosing patients who suffer from these harmful diseases.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing beta-amyloid PET images from T1-weighted Structural MRI: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-amyloid positron emission tomography (A$\beta$-PET) imaging has become a critical tool in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research and diagnosis, providing insights into the pathological accumulation of amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. However, the high cost, limited availability, and exposure to radioactivity restrict the widespread use of A$\beta$-PET imaging, leading to a scarcity of comprehensive datasets. Previous studies have suggested that structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is more readily available, may serve as a viable alternative for synthesizing A$\beta$-PET images. In this study, we propose an approach to utilize 3D diffusion models to synthesize A$\beta$-PET images from T1-weighted MRI scans, aiming to overcome the limitations associated with direct PET imaging. Our method generates high-quality A$\beta$-PET images for cognitive normal cases, although it is less effective for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to the variability in A$\beta$ deposition patterns among subjects. Our preliminary results suggest that incorporating additional data, such as a larger sample of MCI cases and multi-modality information including clinical and demographic details, cognitive and functional assessments, and longitudinal data, may be necessary to improve A$\beta$-PET image synthesis for MCI patients.</description>

      <title>Deep-ER: Deep Learning ECCENTRIC Reconstruction for fast high-resolution neurometabolic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Altered neurometabolism is an important pathological mechanism in many neurological diseases and brain cancer, which can be mapped non-invasively by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI). Advanced MRSI using non-cartesian compressed-sense acquisition enables fast high-resolution metabolic imaging but has lengthy reconstruction times that limits throughput and needs expert user interaction. Here, we present a robust and efficient Deep Learning reconstruction to obtain high-quality metabolic maps.
  Methods: Fast high-resolution whole-brain metabolic imaging was performed at 3.4 mm$^3$ isotropic resolution with acquisition times between 4:11-9:21 min:s using ECCENTRIC pulse sequence on a 7T MRI scanner. Data were acquired in a high-resolution phantom and 27 human participants, including 22 healthy volunteers and 5 glioma patients. A deep neural network using recurring interlaced convolutional layers with joint dual-space feature representation was developed for deep learning ECCENTRIC reconstruction (Deep-ER). 21 subjects were used for training and 6 subjects for testing. Deep-ER performance was compared to conventional iterative Total Generalized Variation reconstruction using image and spectral quality metrics.
  Results: Deep-ER demonstrated 600-fold faster reconstruction than conventional methods, providing improved spatial-spectral quality and metabolite quantification with 12%-45% (P&lt;0.05) higher signal-to-noise and 8%-50% (P&lt;0.05) smaller Cramer-Rao lower bounds. Metabolic images clearly visualize glioma tumor heterogeneity and boundary.
  Conclusion: Deep-ER provides efficient and robust reconstruction for sparse-sampled MRSI. The accelerated acquisition-reconstruction MRSI is compatible with high-throughput imaging workflow. It is expected that such improved performance will facilitate basic and clinical MRSI applications.</description>

      <title>Photon Inhibition for Energy-Efficient Single-Photon Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon cameras (SPCs) are emerging as sensors of choice for various challenging imaging applications. One class of SPCs based on the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detects individual photons using an avalanche process; the raw photon data can then be processed to extract scene information under extremely low light, high dynamic range, and rapid motion. Yet, single-photon sensitivity in SPADs comes at a cost -- each photon detection consumes more energy than that of a CMOS camera. This avalanche power significantly limits sensor resolution and could restrict widespread adoption of SPAD-based SPCs. We propose a computational-imaging approach called \emph{photon inhibition} to address this challenge. Photon inhibition strategically allocates detections in space and time based on downstream inference task goals and resource constraints. We develop lightweight, on-sensor computational inhibition policies that use past photon data to disable SPAD pixels in real-time, to select the most informative future photons. As case studies, we design policies tailored for image reconstruction and edge detection, and demonstrate, both via simulations and real SPC captured data, considerable reduction in photon detections (over 90\% of photons) while maintaining task performance metrics. Our work raises the question of ``which photons should be detected?'', and paves the way for future energy-efficient single-photon imaging.</description>

      <title>DRL-STNet: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-modality Medical Image Segmentation via Disentangled Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is essential for medical image segmentation, especially in cross-modality data scenarios. UDA aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, thereby reducing the dependency on extensive manual annotations. This paper presents DRL-STNet, a novel framework for cross-modality medical image segmentation that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs), disentangled representation learning (DRL), and self-training (ST). Our method leverages DRL within a GAN to translate images from the source to the target modality. Then, the segmentation model is initially trained with these translated images and corresponding source labels and then fine-tuned iteratively using a combination of synthetic and real images with pseudo-labels and real labels. The proposed framework exhibits superior performance in abdominal organ segmentation on the FLARE challenge dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 11.4% in the Dice similarity coefficient and by 13.1% in the Normalized Surface Dice metric, achieving scores of 74.21% and 80.69%, respectively. The average running time is 41 seconds, and the area under the GPU memory-time curve is 11,292 MB. These results indicate the potential of DRL-STNet for enhancing cross-modality medical image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Med-IC: Fusing a Single Layer Involution with Convolutions for Enhanced Medical Image Classification and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of medical images, especially those that resemble cells, have similar characteristics. These images, which occur in a variety of shapes, often show abnormalities in the organ or cell region. The convolution operation possesses a restricted capability to extract visual patterns across several spatial regions of an image. The involution process, which is the inverse operation of convolution, complements this inherent lack of spatial information extraction present in convolutions. In this study, we investigate how applying a single layer of involution prior to a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture can significantly improve classification and segmentation performance, with a comparatively negligible amount of weight parameters. The study additionally shows how excessive use of involution layers might result in inaccurate predictions in a particular type of medical image. According to our findings from experiments, the strategy of adding only a single involution layer before a CNN-based model outperforms most of the previous works.</description>

      <title>Towards Integrating Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation into the Radiotherapy Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of contouring target structures and organs-at-risk (OAR) in radiotherapy planning is crucial for ensuring treatment efficacy and patient safety. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have significantly improved OAR contouring performance, yet the reliability of these models, especially in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, remains a concern in clinical settings. This application study explores the integration of epistemic uncertainty estimation within the OAR contouring workflow to enable OOD detection in clinically relevant scenarios, using specifically compiled data. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced statistical method for OOD detection to enhance the methodological framework of uncertainty estimation. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that epistemic uncertainty estimation is effective in identifying instances where model predictions are unreliable and may require an expert review. Notably, our approach achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.95 for OOD detection, with a specificity of 0.95 and a sensitivity of 0.92 for implant cases, underscoring its efficacy. This study addresses significant gaps in the current research landscape, such as the lack of ground truth for uncertainty estimation and limited empirical evaluations. Additionally, it provides a clinically relevant application of epistemic uncertainty estimation in an FDA-approved and widely used clinical solution for OAR segmentation from Varian, a Siemens Healthineers company, highlighting its practical benefits.</description>

      <title>3DPX: Single Panoramic X-ray Analysis Guided by 3D Oral Structure Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic X-ray (PX) is a prevalent modality in dentistry practice owing to its wide availability and low cost. However, as a 2D projection of a 3D structure, PX suffers from anatomical information loss and PX diagnosis is limited compared to that with 3D imaging modalities. 2D-to-3D reconstruction methods have been explored for the ability to synthesize the absent 3D anatomical information from 2D PX for use in PX image analysis. However, there are challenges in leveraging such 3D synthesized reconstructions. First, inferring 3D depth from 2D images remains a challenging task with limited accuracy. The second challenge is the joint analysis of 2D PX with its 3D synthesized counterpart, with the aim to maximize the 2D-3D synergy while minimizing the errors arising from the synthesized image. In this study, we propose a new method termed 3DPX - PX image analysis guided by 2D-to-3D reconstruction, to overcome these challenges. 3DPX consists of (i) a novel progressive reconstruction network to improve 2D-to-3D reconstruction and, (ii) a contrastive-guided bidirectional multimodality alignment module for 3D-guided 2D PX classification and segmentation tasks. The reconstruction network progressively reconstructs 3D images with knowledge imposed on the intermediate reconstructions at multiple pyramid levels and incorporates Multilayer Perceptrons to improve semantic understanding. The downstream networks leverage the reconstructed images as 3D anatomical guidance to the PX analysis through feature alignment, which increases the 2D-3D synergy with bidirectional feature projection and decease the impact of potential errors with contrastive guidance. Extensive experiments on two oral datasets involving 464 studies demonstrate that 3DPX outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in various tasks including 2D-to-3D reconstruction, PX classification and lesion segmentation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Complexity-Rate-Quality Pareto-Front for Adaptive VVC Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pareto-front optimization is crucial for addressing the multi-objective challenges in video streaming, enabling the identification of optimal trade-offs between conflicting goals such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity. This paper explores the construction of efficient bitrate ladders for adaptive Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming, focusing on optimizing these trade-offs. We investigate various ladder construction methods based on Pareto-front optimization, including exhaustive Rate-Quality and fixed ladder approaches. We propose a joint decoding time-rate-quality Pareto-front, providing a comprehensive framework to balance bitrate, decoding time, and video quality in video streaming. This allows streaming services to tailor their encoding strategies to meet specific requirements, prioritizing low decoding latency, bandwidth efficiency, or a balanced approach, thus enhancing the overall user experience. The experimental results confirm and demonstrate these opportunities for navigating the decoding time-rate-quality space to support various use cases. For example, when prioritizing low decoding latency, the proposed method achieves decoding time reduction of 14.86% while providing Bjontegaard delta rate savings of 4.65% and 0.32dB improvement in the eXtended Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (XPSNR)-Rate domain over the traditional fixed ladder solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Medical Image Fusion For Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early detection and nuanced subtype classification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a predominant cause of cancer mortality worldwide, is a critical and complex issue. In this paper, we introduce an innovative integration of multi-modal data, synthesizing fused medical imaging (CT and PET scans) with clinical health records and genomic data. This unique fusion methodology leverages advanced machine learning models, notably MedClip and BEiT, for sophisticated image feature extraction, setting a new standard in computational oncology. Our research surpasses existing approaches, as evidenced by a substantial enhancement in NSCLC detection and classification precision. The results showcase notable improvements across key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Specifically, our leading multi-modal classifier model records an impressive accuracy of 94.04%. We believe that our approach has the potential to transform NSCLC diagnostics, facilitating earlier detection and more effective treatment planning and, ultimately, leading to superior patient outcomes in lung cancer care.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of learning-based image codecs on fingerprint storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of learning-based coding techniques and the development of learning-based image coding standards, such as JPEG-AI, point towards the adoption of such solutions in different fields, including the storage of biometric data, like fingerprints. However, the peculiar nature of learning-based compression artifacts poses several issues concerning their impact and effectiveness on extracting biometric features and landmarks, e.g., minutiae. This problem is utterly stressed by the fact that most models are trained on natural color images, whose characteristics are very different from usual biometric images, e.g, fingerprint or iris pictures. As a matter of fact, these issues are deemed to be accurately questioned and investigated, being such analysis still largely unexplored.
  This study represents the first investigation about the adaptability of learning-based image codecs in the storage of fingerprint images by measuring its impact on the extraction and characterization of minutiae. Experimental results show that at a fixed rate point, learned solutions considerably outperform previous fingerprint coding standards, like JPEG2000, both in terms of distortion and minutiae preservation. Indeed, experimental results prove that the peculiarities of learned compression artifacts do not prevent automatic fingerprint identification (since minutiae types and locations are not significantly altered), nor do compromise image quality for human visual inspection (as they gain in terms of BD rate and PSNR of 47.8% and +3.97dB respectively).</description>

      <title>A Generalized Tensor Formulation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution Under General Spatial Blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral super-resolution is commonly accomplished by the fusing of a hyperspectral imaging of low spatial resolution with a multispectral image of high spatial resolution, and many tensor-based approaches to this task have been recently proposed. Yet, it is assumed in such tensor-based methods that the spatial-blurring operation that creates the observed hyperspectral image from the desired super-resolved image is separable into independent horizontal and vertical blurring. Recent work has argued that such separable spatial degradation is ill-equipped to model the operation of real sensors which may exhibit, for example, anisotropic blurring. To accommodate this fact, a generalized tensor formulation based on a Kronecker decomposition is proposed to handle any general spatial-degradation matrix, including those that are not separable as previously assumed. Analysis of the generalized formulation reveals conditions under which exact recovery of the desired super-resolved image is guaranteed, and a practical algorithm for such recovery, driven by a blockwise-group-sparsity regularization, is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed generalized tensor approach outperforms not only traditional matrix-based techniques but also state-of-the-art tensor-based methods; the gains with respect to the latter are especially significant in cases of anisotropic spatial blurring.</description>

      <title>DualDn: Dual-domain Denoising via Differentiable ISP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising is a critical component in a camera's Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. There are two typical ways to inject a denoiser into the ISP pipeline: applying a denoiser directly to captured raw frames (raw domain) or to the ISP's output sRGB images (sRGB domain). However, both approaches have their limitations. Residual noise from raw-domain denoising can be amplified by the subsequent ISP processing, and the sRGB domain struggles to handle spatially varying noise since it only sees noise distorted by the ISP. Consequently, most raw or sRGB domain denoising works only for specific noise distributions and ISP configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DualDn, a novel learning-based dual-domain denoising. Unlike previous single-domain denoising, DualDn consists of two denoising networks: one in the raw domain and one in the sRGB domain. The raw domain denoising adapts to sensor-specific noise as well as spatially varying noise levels, while the sRGB domain denoising adapts to ISP variations and removes residual noise amplified by the ISP. Both denoising networks are connected with a differentiable ISP, which is trained end-to-end and discarded during the inference stage. With this design, DualDn achieves greater generalizability compared to most learning-based denoising methods, as it can adapt to different unseen noises, ISP parameters, and even novel ISP pipelines. Experiments show that DualDn achieves state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to different denoising architectures. Moreover, DualDn can be used as a plug-and-play denoising module with real cameras without retraining, and still demonstrate better performance than commercial on-camera denoising.

      <title>Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images with deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is acknowledged that the most common cause of dementia worldwide is Alzheimer's disease (AD). This condition progresses in severity from mild to severe and interferes with people's everyday routines. Early diagnosis plays a critical role in patient care and clinical trials. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to create a framework for identifying specific disease features from MRI scans Classification of dementia involves approaches such as medical history review, neuropsychological tests, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the image dataset obtained from Kaggle faces a significant issue of class imbalance, which requires equal distribution of samples from each class to address. In this article, to address this imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is utilized. Furthermore, a pre-trained convolutional neural network has been applied to the DEMNET dementia network to extract key features from AD images. The proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.67%.</description>

      <title>Simulating Dynamic Tumor Contrast Enhancement in Breast MRI using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for virtual contrast enhancement in breast MRI, offering a promising non-invasive alternative to traditional contrast agent-based DCE-MRI acquisition. Using a conditional generative adversarial network, we predict DCE-MRI images, including jointly-generated sequences of multiple corresponding DCE-MRI timepoints, from non-contrast-enhanced MRIs, enabling tumor localization and characterization without the associated health risks. Furthermore, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the synthetic DCE-MRI images, proposing a multi-metric Scaled Aggregate Measure (SAMe), assessing their utility in a tumor segmentation downstream task, and conclude with an analysis of the temporal patterns in multi-sequence DCE-MRI generation. Our approach demonstrates promising results in generating realistic and useful DCE-MRI sequences, highlighting the potential of virtual contrast enhancement for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly for patients where contrast agent administration is contraindicated.</description>

      <title>Spatial Visibility and Temporal Dynamics: Revolutionizing Field of View Prediction in Adaptive Point Cloud Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning Model for Key Frame Identification from Cow Teat Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy of mastitis risk assessment in cows using neural networks and video analysis. Mastitis, an infection of the udder tissue, is a critical health problem for cows and can be detected by examining the cow's teat. Traditionally, veterinarians assess the health of a cow's teat during the milking process, but this process is limited in time and can weaken the accuracy of the assessment. In commercial farms, cows are recorded by cameras when they are milked in the milking parlor. This paper uses a neural network to identify key frames in the recorded video where the cow's udder appears intact. These key frames allow veterinarians to have more flexible time to perform health assessments on the teat, increasing their efficiency and accuracy. However, there are challenges in using cow teat video for mastitis risk assessment, such as complex environments, changing cow positions and postures, and difficulty in identifying the udder from the video. To address these challenges, a fusion distance and an ensemble model are proposed to improve the performance (F-score) of identifying key frames from cow teat videos. The results show that these two approaches improve performance compared to using a single distance measure or model.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Low-light Image Enhancement with Lookup Tables and Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LIE) aims at precisely and efficiently recovering an image degraded in poor illumination environments. Recent advanced LIE techniques are using deep neural networks, which require lots of low-normal light image pairs, network parameters, and computational resources. As a result, their practicality is limited. In this work, we devise a novel unsupervised LIE framework based on diffusion priors and lookup tables (DPLUT) to achieve efficient low-light image recovery. The proposed approach comprises two critical components: a light adjustment lookup table (LLUT) and a noise suppression lookup table (NLUT). LLUT is optimized with a set of unsupervised losses. It aims at predicting pixel-wise curve parameters for the dynamic range adjustment of a specific image. NLUT is designed to remove the amplified noise after the light brightens. As diffusion models are sensitive to noise, diffusion priors are introduced to achieve high-performance noise suppression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Improving Visual Object Tracking through Visual Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning a discriminative model to distinguish a target from its surrounding distractors is essential to generic visual object tracking. Dynamic target representation adaptation against distractors is challenging due to the limited discriminative capabilities of prevailing trackers. We present a new visual Prompting mechanism for generic Visual Object Tracking (PiVOT) to address this issue. PiVOT proposes a prompt generation network with the pre-trained foundation model CLIP to automatically generate and refine visual prompts, enabling the transfer of foundation model knowledge for tracking. While CLIP offers broad category-level knowledge, the tracker, trained on instance-specific data, excels at recognizing unique object instances. Thus, PiVOT first compiles a visual prompt highlighting potential target locations. To transfer the knowledge of CLIP to the tracker, PiVOT leverages CLIP to refine the visual prompt based on the similarities between candidate objects and the reference templates across potential targets. Once the visual prompt is refined, it can better highlight potential target locations, thereby reducing irrelevant prompt information. With the proposed prompting mechanism, the tracker can generate improved instance-aware feature maps through the guidance of the visual prompt, thus effectively reducing distractors. The proposed method does not involve CLIP during training, thereby keeping the same training complexity and preserving the generalization capability of the pretrained foundation model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks indicate that PiVOT, using the proposed prompting method can suppress distracting objects and enhance the tracker.</description>

      <title>Implicit Image-to-Image Schrodinger Bridge for Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models are widely recognized for their effectiveness in image restoration tasks; however, their iterative denoising process, which begins from Gaussian noise, often results in slow inference speeds. The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining equal or improved fidelity to the ground truth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence histology data is emerging as an important method for understanding the tumour micro-environment in cancer. This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers. Distinctively, HEMIT's mIHC images are multi-component and cellular-level aligned with H&amp;E, enriching supervised stain translation tasks. To our knowledge, HEMIT is the first publicly available cellular-level aligned dataset that enables H&amp;E to multi-target mIHC image translation. This dataset provides the computer vision community with a valuable resource to develop novel computational methods which have the potential to gain new insights from H&amp;E slide archives.
  We also propose a new dual-branch generator architecture, using residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin Transformers which achieves better translation outcomes than other popular algorithms. When evaluated on HEMIT, it outperforms pix2pixHD, pix2pix, U-Net, and ResNet, achieving the highest overall score on key metrics including the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Pearson correlation score (R), and Peak signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, downstream analysis has been used to further validate the quality of the generated mIHC images. These results set a new benchmark in the field of stain translation tasks.</description>

Abstract: Trauma significantly impacts global health, accounting for over 5 million deaths annually, which is comparable to mortality rates from diseases such as tuberculosis, AIDS, and malaria. In Iran, the financial repercussions of road traffic accidents represent approximately 2% of the nation's Gross National Product each year. Bleeding is the leading cause of mortality in trauma patients within the first 24 hours following an injury, making rapid diagnosis and assessment of severity crucial. Trauma patients require comprehensive scans of all organs, generating a large volume of data. Evaluating CT images for the entire body is time-consuming and requires significant expertise, underscoring the need for efficient time management in diagnosis. Efficient diagnostic processes can significantly reduce treatment costs and decrease the likelihood of secondary complications. In this context, the development of a reliable Decision Support System (DSS) for trauma triage, particularly focused on the abdominal area, is vital. This paper presents a novel method for detecting liver bleeding and lacerations using CT scans, utilising the GAN Pix2Pix translation model. The effectiveness of the method is quantified by Dice score metrics, with the model achieving an accuracy of 97% for liver bleeding and 93% for liver laceration detection. These results represent a notable improvement over current state-of-the-art technologies. The system's design integrates seamlessly with existing medical imaging technologies, making it a practical addition to emergency medical services. This research underscores the potential of advanced image translation models like GAN Pix2Pix in improving the precision and speed of medical diagnostics in critical care scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for the Automated Characterization of Gram-Stained Blood Culture Slides Using a Large-Scale Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new framework for the artificial intelligence-assisted characterization of Gram-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). As a test for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections, Gram stains provide critical early data to inform patient treatment. Rapid and reliable analysis of Gram stains has been shown to be positively associated with better clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for improved tools to automate Gram stain analysis. In this work, we developed a novel transformer-based model for Gram-stained WSI classification, which is more scalable to large datasets than previous convolutional neural network (CNN) -based methods as it does not require patch-level manual annotations. We also introduce a large Gram stain dataset from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA) to evaluate our model, exploring the classification of five major categories of Gram-stained WSIs: Gram-positive cocci in clusters, Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, Gram-positive rods, Gram-negative rods, and slides with no bacteria. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.805, 0.905) and an AUC of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.922, 0.976) using five-fold nested cross-validation on our 475-slide dataset, demonstrating the potential of large-scale transformer models for Gram stain classification. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our trained model, which achieves strong performance on external datasets without additional fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: Full-reference point cloud quality assessment (FR-PCQA) aims to infer the quality of distorted point clouds with available references. Most of the existing FR-PCQA metrics ignore the fact that the human visual system (HVS) dynamically tackles visual information according to different distortion levels (i.e., distortion detection for high-quality samples and appearance perception for low-quality samples) and measure point cloud quality using unified features. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose a perception-guided hybrid metric (PHM) that adaptively leverages two visual strategies with respect to distortion degree to predict point cloud quality: to measure visible difference in high-quality samples, PHM takes into account the masking effect and employs texture complexity as an effective compensatory factor for absolute difference; on the other hand, PHM leverages spectral graph theory to evaluate appearance degradation in low-quality samples. Variations in geometric signals on graphs and changes in the spectral graph wavelet coefficients are utilized to characterize geometry and texture appearance degradation, respectively. Finally, the results obtained from the two components are combined in a non-linear method to produce an overall quality score of the tested point cloud. The results of the experiment on five independent databases show that PHM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers significant performance improvement in multiple distortion environments.
