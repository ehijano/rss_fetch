      <title>Inhibition of whisker growth by crafting more decomposition-resistant Ti2SnC MAX phase through vanadium solid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional synergy of ceramic and metallic properties within MAX phases positions them as highly promising for a wide array of applications. However, their stability has been threatened by the phenomenon of A-site metal whisker growth. Herein, we have significantly mitigated tin whisker growth in Ti2SnC by incorporating vanadium solutes at its M-site. With an increase in vanadium concentration, there is a marked reduction in the degree of decomposition of the M-site solid solution when subjected to the same level of externally destructive treatments, thereby inhibiting whisker proliferation. Both experimental outcomes and theoretical calculations reveal that the vanadium solid solution augments the hardness, Pughs ratio, and Poissons ratio of Ti2SnC, enhancing its mechanical strength and toughness. The incorporation of V atoms introduces stronger V C and V Sn bonds, as evidenced by its electronic density of states and bulk modulus, thus significantly bolstering the resistance of MAX phases against decomposition and effectively curtailing whisker growth. Additionally, the phenomenon reported in this paper also conforms to the electrostatic theory of whisker growth. This work for the first time achieves the suppression of A-site whisker growth through an M-site solid solution, thereby extending their potential for applications where durability and reliability are paramount.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Thermodynamics of Al$_{10}$V: An Analytical Treatment of Localized Anharmonic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex intermetallic structures possess cage-like environments that can host additional guest atoms. In Al$_{10}$V, these atoms give rise to low-frequency, localized vibrations (Einstein modes) that dominate the thermodynamic response at low temperature. They become imaginary under volume expansion as temperature rises, invalidating the harmonic approximation. We develop a framework to incorporate these strongly anharmonic vibrational modes into first-principles thermodynamic calculations. By explicitly modeling the cage potential and solving the associated Schr\"odinger equation numerically, we compute the full anharmonic free energy contribution and demonstrate its impact on thermodynamic phase stability. Our results reproduce key experimental signatures, including the anomalous rise in the thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat at low temperatures, and reveal that the presence of guest atoms is essential to stabilizing the Al$_{10}$V phase at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of the electromagnon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytical theory of the electromagnon resonance for the multiferroics of spin origin. We consider the spin density evolution under the influence of magnetoelectric coupling in the presence of the electromagnetic wave. The dielectric permeability is found for the eigen-wave perturbations accompanied by perturbations of the electric field. The imaginary part of the dielectric permeability is found as the function of the applied electric field frequency, while the frequency of the eigen-waves is found from the dispersion equation as the function of the wave vector and parameters of the system. The result shows the existence of two peaks. One sharp peak is associated with the magnon resonance, while the second wide peak at the approximately four times smaller frequency is interpreted as the electromagnon resonance in accordance with existing experimental data.</description>

      <title>A new Surrogate Microstructure Generator for Porous Materials with Applications to the Buffer Layer of TRISO Nuclear Fuel Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a surrogate material model for generating microstructure samples reproducing the morphology of the real material. The generator is based on Gaussian random fields, with a Mat\'ern kernel and a topological support field defined through ellipsoidal inclusions clustered by a random walk algorithm. We identify the surrogate model parameters by minimizing misfits in a list of statistical and geometrical descriptors of the material microstructure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for porous nuclear materials, we apply the generator to the buffer layer of Tristructural Isotropic Nuclear Fuel (TRISO) particles. This part has been shown to be failure sensitive part of TRISO nuclear fuel and our generator is optimized with respect to a dataset of FIB-SEM tomography across the buffer layer thickness. We evaluate the performance by applying mechanical modeling with problems of linear elastic homogenization and linear elastic brittle fracture material properties and comparing the behaviour of the dataset microstructure and the surrogate microstructure. This shows good agreement between the dataset microstructure and the generated microstructures over a large range of porosities.</description>

      <title>Unveiling defect motifs in amorphous GeSe using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ovonic threshold switching (OTS) selectors play a critical role in non-volatile memory devices because of their nonlinear electrical behavior and polarity-dependent threshold voltages. However, the atomic-scale origins of the defect states responsible for these properties are not yet fully understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by machine-learning interatomic potentials to investigate defects in amorphous GeSe. We begin by benchmarking several potential architectures-including descriptor-based models and graph neural network (GNN) models-and show that faithfully representing amorphous GeSe requires capturing higher-order interactions (at least four-body correlations) and medium-range structural order. We find that GNN architectures with multiple interaction layers successfully capture these correlations and structural motifs, preventing the spurious defects that less expressive models introduce. With our optimized GNN potential, we examine twenty independent 960-atom amorphous GeSe structures and identify two distinct defect motifs: aligned Ge chains, which give rise to defect states near the conduction band, and overcoordinated Ge chains, which produce defect states near the valence band. We further correlate these electronic defect levels with specific structural features-namely, the average alignment of bond angles in the aligned chains and the degree of local Peierls distortion around overcoordinated Ge atoms. These findings provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and deepen our understanding of defect-driven OTS phenomena in amorphous GeSe.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of three-dimensional Kane plasmons in the narrow-bandgap Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.</description>

      <title>Advancing atomic electron tomography with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of three-dimensional (3D) atomic structures is crucial for understanding and controlling the properties of nanomaterials. Atomic electron tomography (AET) offers non-destructive atomic imaging with picometer-level precision, enabling the resolution of defects, interfaces, and strain fields in 3D, as well as the observation of dynamic structural evolution. However, reconstruction artifacts arising from geometric limitations and electron dose constraints can hinder reliable atomic structure determination. Recent progress has integrated deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, into AET workflows to improve reconstruction fidelity. This review highlights recent advances in neural network-assisted AET, emphasizing its role in overcoming persistent challenges in 3D atomic imaging. By significantly enhancing the accuracy of both surface and bulk structural characterization, these methods are advancing the frontiers of nanoscience and enabling new opportunities in materials research and technology.</description>

      <title>Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral in-plane heterostructures enable precise control of electronic properties and quantum effects in 2D materials. However, their periodic synthesis is challenging because it requires precise control to maintain sharp, coherent interfaces and compatible growth conditions across different domains. Herein, we report the successful heteroepitaxial growth of Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 and periodic lateral heterostructures on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) through in-situ multiple growth steps at different stages using a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. These trilateral heterostructures are fabricated by growing triangular or hexagonal Bi2Te3 islands at the very beginning, with typical sizes of several hundred nanometers, on the single-crystalline hBN, followed by the lateral growth of Sb2Te3 to form bilateral heterostructures, and finally growing Bi2Te3 on the side facets of the bilateral heterostructures. The electron microscopy results confirm the core area as Bi2Te3, the intermediate layer as Sb2Te3, and the outermost region as Bi2Te3. The resulting heterostructures are approximately 4-8 nm thick and several hundred nanometers in lateral dimensions. These heterostructures are found to grow epitaxially on hBN (&lt; +-4 deg misalignment), and the individual layers are strongly epitaxially aligned with each other. The in-plane heterojunctions are analyzed using the aberration-corrected (Cs-corrected) high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy technique. We have explored and established the plasmonic properties of these fabricated Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 lateral heterostructures. In addition, the electronic states and the topological properties of the few quintuple layers (QLs) (2- to 4-QLs) Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 lateral periodic heterostructures are investigated by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of zero-dimensional topological states in ultranarrow germanene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected zero-dimensional (0D) modes, such as corner and end states with fractionalized charge, promise robust qubits and efficient electronics. Yet, reversible, electric-field manipulation and control of these modes has remained elusive. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally electric-field-driven on/off switching of 0D topological end modes in two- and three-hexagon wide germanene nanoribbons in a vertical tunnel junction set-up. We demonstrate the annihilation and restoration of end states in topological samples, but also the induction of 0D topological modes in initially trivial ribbons. The process is reversible, and the system operates at 77 Kelvin. This atomic-scale platform realizes a proof-of-principle for a 0D topological field-effect device, opening an unexpected path for ultra-small memory, quantum computing, and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Vibrational properties of epitaxial graphene buffer layer on silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibrational properties of semiconducting graphene buffer layer epitaxially grown on hexagonal silicon carbide are determined using first-principles calculations on a realistic structural model. Despite the important chemical and structural disorder associated with the partial covalent bonding with the substrate, the buffer-layer carbon atoms still display quasidispersive phonons mimicking those of graphene. The related frequency softening and broadening provide a natural interpretation of the measured Raman signal. The vibrations determining thermal conduction are found to delocalize completely on the SiC substrate, leading to an effective spatial separation between material components determining, respectively, electronic and thermal transport properties. This situation opens perspectives for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties of Janus bilayer Cl3Cr2I3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material CrI3 has aroused extensive attention, because it could provide a new platform for investigating the relations between crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we study crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties of three configurations (Cl-Cl I-I and Cl-I) of Janus bilayer Cl3Cr2I3 with two stacking orders (AB and AA1=3) by using the first principles approach incorporating the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect and the dipole correction. It is found that the spin polarization and the SOC effect can expand the lattice constant and the interlayer distance (ID) of the three configurations. Especially, the ID of the I-I configuration is 1 {\AA} larger than that of the Cl-Cl configuration. The total energy calculation results show that the atomic configuration, the SOC effect and the stacking order play an important role in determining the magnetic ground states of the Janus layers. Our results indicate the atomic configurations of the Janus bilayers are not conducive to the increase of critical temperature. Interestingly, the Cl-I configuration has a vertical dipole moment, and its AFM state has large spin splitting. It is revealed that the non-periodic structure, the symmetry breaking of the average potential and the weak interlayer interaction lead to the vertical dipole moment and the abnormal AFM state that is not the most stable state.</description>

      <title>High-speed quantitative nanomechanical mapping by photothermal off-resonance atomic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure surface topography of solid, soft, and living matter at the nanoscale. Moreover, by mapping forces as a function of distance to the surface, AFM can provide a wealth of information beyond topography, with nanomechanical properties as a prime example. Here we present a method based on photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT) to increase the speed of such force spectroscopy measurements by at least an order of magnitude, thereby enabling high-throughput, quantitative nanomechanical mapping of a wide range of materials. Specifically, we use photothermal actuation to modulate the position of the AFM probe at frequencies that far exceed those possible with traditional actuation by piezo-driven z scanners. Understanding and accounting for the microscale thermal and mechanical behavior of the AFM probe, we determine the resulting probe position at sufficient accuracy to allow rapid and quantitative nanomechanical examination of polymeric and metallic materials.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale FEM Model of Concrete: Statistical Assessment of Inherent Stress Concentrations in Dependence on Phase Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate-cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution. Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field. The results are based on a statistical evaluation of stress concentrations arising from variations in material stiffness. The model is applied to investigate the impact of using recycled crushed bricks as aggregates in concrete, with particular emphasis on the stiffness mismatch between the matrix and aggregates. The study examines how this stiffness contrast affects stress distribution and ultimately influences the composite's failure mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Preferred Synthesis of Armchair SnS2 Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.</description>

      <title>XHEMTs on Ultrawide Bandgap Single-Crystal AlN Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlN has the largest bandgap in the wurtzite III-nitride semiconductor family, making it an ideal barrier for a thin GaN channel to achieve strong carrier confinement in field-effect transistors, analogous to silicon-on-insulator technology. Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth of Chalcogenides and Oxy-Chalcogenides Using Chloride Exchange Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides, including complex chalcogenides and transition metal dichalcogenides, are emerging semiconductors with direct or indirect band gaps within the visible spectrum. These materials are being explored for various photonic and electronic applications, such as photodetectors, photovoltaics, and phase-change electronics. Understanding the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for optimizing their functionalities. Therefore, the availability of large, high-quality single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides is essential for a better comprehension of their structure and properties. In this study, we present a novel crystal growth method that utilizes the exchange reaction between BaS and ZrCl$_4$/ HfCl$_4$. By carefully controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the binary sulfide to the chloride, we can grow single crystals of several materials, such as ZrS$_2$, HfS$_2$, BaZrS$_3$, and ZrOS. This method results in large single crystals with a short reaction time of 24 to 48 hours. High-resolution thin film diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirm the quality of the crystals produced through this exchange reaction. We also report the optical properties of these materials investigated using photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The chloride exchange reaction method paves the way for the synthesis of single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenide systems with a short reaction time but with low mosaicity and can be an alternative growth technique for single crystals of materials that are difficult to synthesize using conventional growth techniques.</description>

      <title>Giant Magneto-Optical Effects in Two-Dimensional Flat-Band Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal giant magneto-optical responses in two-dimensional(2D) antiferromagnets with nearly flat electronic bands, based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretical analysis. We identify a record-large second-order magneto-optical Schafer-Hubert(SH) effect, featuring a polarization rotation angle of 28 degree, in monolayer antiferromagnetic RuOCl2, driven by flatband-enhanced interband optical transitions. Both the valence and conduction bands exhibit pronounced directional flatness, giving rise to highly anisotropic optical absorption and broadband hyperbolic frequency windows spanning the entire visible spectrum. This anisotropy leads to an exceptionally strong linear dichroism (LD) reaching 50%, far exceeding values reported in other 2D magnetic systems. Remarkably, the giant SH effect and LD appear at distinct photon energies, reflecting a momentum-direction-dependent crossover between flat and dispersive bands. Both responses are further amplified with increasing RuOCl2 film thickness. Our results establish flat-band antiferromagnets as a fertile platform for realizing giant nonlinear magneto-optical effects and open new avenues for 2D opto-spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Negative capacitance overcomes Schottky-gate limits in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Potentials for Alloys: A Detailed Workflow to Predict Phase Diagrams and Benchmark Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their unique structural and functional properties. In the study of HEAs, thermodynamic properties and phase stability play a crucial role, making phase diagram calculations significantly important. However, phase diagram calculations with conventional CALPHAD assessments based on experimental or ab-initio data can be expensive. With the emergence of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we have developed a program named PhaseForge, which integrates MLIPs into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) framework using our MLIP calculation library, MaterialsFramework, to enable efficient exploration of alloy phase diagrams. Moreover, our workflow can also serve as a benchmarking tool for evaluating the quality of different MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Non-collinear magnetism contra frustration: Magnetic order and anisotropy in hexagonal MnPtGa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Hop-Decorate: An Automated Atomistic Workflow for Generating Defect Transport Data in Chemically Complex Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemically complex materials (CCMs) exhibit extraordinary functional properties but pose significant challenges for atomistic modeling due to their vast configurational heterogeneity. We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Role of hydrogen dynamics and deposition conditions in photochromic YHO/MoO$_3$ bilayer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Effective Mass on ab initio Phonon-limited Electron Mobility of GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</description>

      <title>A many-body characterization of the fundamental gap in monolayer CrI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Quantitative correlation between structural (dis-)order and diffuseness of phase transition in lead scandium tantalate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics show a phase transition to a paraelectric phase at a well-defined transition temperature. Introducing disorder makes this transition diffuse, and the system becomes a relaxor. Since the degree of (dis-)order is usually manipulated by varying the chemical composition, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between disorder and the degree of diffuseness. Perovskite structured lead scandium tantalate (Pb[Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$]O$_3$, PST) offers the opportunity to tune the character of the transition by thermal annealing without changing the stoichiometry. Here it is demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the structural ordering, quantified by the intensity ratio $S$ of the pseudocubic (111)/(200) x-ray diffraction peaks, and the diffuseness parameter $\gamma$ deduced from temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. The relation is universal, independent of whether the sample is a thin film, multilayer capacitor or bulk ceramic, and also independent of the absolute value of the dielectric permittivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. Here we propose a previously unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This novel MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. Our results are demonstrated in semimetal WTe$_2$ thin films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based Artificial Intelligence method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>$La_3Pd_2NaO_9$: A High-Valent Insulating Palladate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-valent palladate, $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$, has been synthesized for the first time. Single crystals with dimensions of 20 ${\mu}$m on edge were successfully grown using the flux method at 420 $^o$C and 70 bar oxygen pressure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP) measurements show that the atomic ratio of La: (Pd+Na) is 3: 3 and Pd: Na is 2: 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the oxidation state of Pd is dominated by +4. Synchrotron X-ray single-crystal diffraction measurements revealed that this material crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with charge ordering of Na and Pd. Real-space imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the crystal structure and revealed excellent sample homogeneity. Electrical resistivity measurements show an insulating behavior. Magnetic measurements show an unexpected paramagnetic behavior, which probably originate from a small fraction of high-spin Pd$^{2+}$ evidenced by XPS. The successful growth of $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$ single crystals with a high-valent oxidation state of Pd offers an approach for exploring interesting palladates, including potential bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper palladates analogous to the high temperature superconducting $La_3Ni_2O_7$.</description>

      <title>Exceedingly large in-plane critical field of finite-momentum pairing state in bulk superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux profoundly influences the phase factor of charge particles, leading to exotic quantum phenomena. A recent example is that the orbital effect of magnetic field could induce finite-momentum pairing state in nanoflakes, which offers a new pathway to realize the spatially modulated superconductivity distinct from the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state induced by Zeeman effect. However, whether such intriguing state can exist in the bulk materials under extremely large magnetic field remains elusive. Here we report the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state with exceedingly large in-plane critical field in a bulk superconducting superlattice. Remarkably, the in-plane critical field shows a pronounced upturn behavior, exceeding eight times the Pauli limit which is comparable to monolayer Ising superconductor. Under high in-plane magnetic fields, significant anisotropic transport behavior between the interlayer and intralayer directions is detected, highlighting the critical role of suppressed interlayer coherence in the orbital effect induced finite-momentum pairing state. Crucially, this finite-momentum pairing state remains robust against moderate disorder. Our findings suggest that van der Waals superlattices, with strong Ising spin-orbit coupling and tunable interlayer coherence, offer new avenues for constructing and modulating unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>An equation of motion for unsteady frictional slip pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.</description>

      <title>Pseudo anomalous Hall effect in semiconductors and semimetals: A classical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-linear field dependence in the Hall effect, often indistinguishable from the anomalous Hall effect, can be realized entirely within the classical mechanism due to the Lorentz force by analyzing multi-valley models for semiconductors and semimetals. The non-linear component in the Hall resistivity $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ originates from carrier mobility anisotropy or the coexistence of different charges. Since $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ is inversely proportional to the carrier difference between electrons and holes $\Delta n$, it exceeds its zero-field value near charge neutrality. As a practical example, we show that the magnitude of the classical non-linear Hall response in ZrTe$_5$ is comparable to the experimental values, underscoring the importance of accounting for classical contributions before attributing non-linear Hall effects to quantum mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electrical charge decay on dielectric surface in nitrogen/C4F7N mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of electrical charge on a dielectric surface in nitrogen-C4F7N (Novec4710, C4) mixtures is investigated using measurement of electric field via in-situ electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) technique. The charge is deposited on the surface of the alumina by generating a barrier discharge in the gap, and the amount of charge is determined from electrical current measurements and numerical modeling. For different admixtures (0, 10, and 50 percent) of C4F7N in nitrogen, the presence of surface charge is detected even 60 hours after charge deposition. It is found that C4F7N admixture lead to a significantly longer-lasting surface charge, indicating a slower charge decay. Using an isothermal charge decay model, charge traps are identified for pure nitrogen charge deposition, which are in agreement with results found in the literature. Charge deposition in C4F7N admixtures leads to modification or creation of new traps with higher trap energies. The EFISH measurements are used to determine the C4F7N nonlinear hyperpolarizability tensor component. Direct comparison of the experimental results from two developed methods (EFISH and electrical measurements) and the numerical model gives a closer insight into the surface charge spread over the dielectrics, resulting in surface charge density estimation.</description>

      <title>Superconducting critical temperature and dimensionality tuning of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ via biaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.</description>

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface. Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observation of a spin-textured nematic Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as dislocations, have a significant impact on the phonon thermal transport properties in non-metallic materials. To unravel these effects, understanding of defect phonon modes is essential. Herein, at the atomic scale, the localized phonons of individual dislocation at a Si/Ge interface are measured via monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. These modes are then correlated with the local microstructure, further revealing the dislocation effects on the local thermal transport properties. The dislocation causes phonon redshift in several milli-electron-volts within about two to four nanometers of the core, where both of the strain field and Ge-segregation play roles. With the presence of dislocation, the local interfacial thermal conductance can be either enhanced or reduced, depending on the complex interaction and competition between lattice-disorder (dislocation) and element-disorder (heterointerface mixing and Ge-segregation) at the interface. These findings provide valuable insights to improve the thermal properties of thermoelectric generators and thermal management systems through proper defect engineering.</description>

Abstract: Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: An ab initio scheme based on the Kubo-Greenwood linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Selection for Efficient MLIP Dataset Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of constructing a dataset for MLIP development which gives the maximum quality in the minimum amount of compute time is complex, and can be approached in a number of ways. We introduce a ``Bayesian selection" approach for selecting from a candidate set of structures, and compare the effectiveness of this method against other common approaches in the task of constructing ideal datasets targeting Silicon surface energies. We show that the Bayesian selection method performs much better than Simple Random Sampling at this task (for example, the error on the (100) surface energy is 4.3x lower in the low data regime), and is competitive with a variety of existing selection methods, using ACE and MACE features.</description>

      <title>Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.</description>

      <title>Energy-resolved tip-orbital fingerprint in scanning tunneling spectroscopy based on the revised Chen's derivative rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast excitation of polar skyrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

      <title>Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</description>

      <title>Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.</description>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for hardware that mimics the brain's ability to extract structure from limited data. In the retina, ganglion cells detect features from sparse inputs via lateral inhibition, where neurons antagonistically suppress activity of neighbouring cells. Biological neurons exhibit diverse heterogeneous nonlinear responses, linked to robust learning and strong performance in low-data regimes.
  Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' photonic system where spatially-competing lasing modes in a network laser act as heterogeneous, inhibitively-coupled neurons - enabling few-shot classification and segmentation. This compact (150 micron) silicon-compatible scheme addresses key challenges in photonic computing: physical nonlinearity and spatial footprint. We report 98.05% and 87.85% accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and 90.12% on BreaKHis cancer diagnosis - outperforming software CNNs including EfficientNet in few-shot and class-imbalanced regimes. We demonstrate combined segmentation and classification on the HAM10k skin lesion dataset, achieving DICE and Jaccard scores of 84.49% and 74.80%. These results establish a new class of nonlinear photonic hardware for versatile, data-efficient neuromorphic computing.</description>

The superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure is predicted to reach 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), with potential further improvements under applied strain. We note that the changes in the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Observation of Orbital-Selective Dual Modulations in an Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Kagome Metal TbTi3Bi4</title>

Abstract: Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power-law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.</description>

Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships is an essential yet challenging aspect of materials discovery and development. To facilitate this process, recent studies in materials informatics have sought latent embedding spaces of crystal structures to capture their similarities based on properties and functionalities. However, abstract feature-based embedding spaces are human-unfriendly and prevent intuitive and efficient exploration of the vast materials space. Here we introduce Contrastive Language--Structure Pre-training (CLaSP), a learning paradigm for constructing crossmodal embedding spaces between crystal structures and texts. CLaSP aims to achieve material embeddings that 1) capture property- and functionality-related similarities between crystal structures and 2) allow intuitive retrieval of materials via user-provided description texts as queries. To compensate for the lack of sufficient datasets linking crystal structures with textual descriptions, CLaSP leverages a dataset of over 400,000 published crystal structures and corresponding publication records, including paper titles and abstracts, for training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLaSP through text-based crystal structure screening and embedding space visualization.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>

Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Framework for Accelerating High-Accuracy Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, the resulting student NNP achieves up to 106x speedup in inference compared to the teacher NNP, enabling significantly faster and more efficient MD simulations.</description>
