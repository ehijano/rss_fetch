      <title>Attention-Enhanced Reservoir Computing as a Multiple Dynamical System Approximator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has proven effective for tasks such as time-series prediction, particularly in the context of chaotic systems. However, conventional reservoir computing frameworks often face challenges in achieving high prediction accuracy and adapting to diverse dynamical problems due to their reliance on fixed weight structures. A concept of an attention-enhanced reservoir computer has been proposed, which integrates an attention mechanism into the output layer of the reservoir computing model. This addition enables the system to prioritize distinct features dynamically, enhancing adaptability and prediction performance. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of the attention-enhanced reservoir computer to learn and predict multiple chaotic attractors simultaneously with a single set of weights, thus enabling transitions between attractors without explicit retraining. The method is validated using benchmark tasks, including the Lorenz system, R\"ossler system, Henon map, Duffing oscillator, and Mackey-Glass delay-differential equation. Our results indicate that the attention-enhanced reservoir computer achieves superior prediction accuracy, valid prediction times, and improved representation of spectral and histogram characteristics compared to traditional reservoir computing methods, establishing it as a robust tool for modeling complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Joint Reduced Model for the Laminar and Chaotic Attractors in Plane Couette Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to develop a low-dimensional reduced-order model for plane Couette flow in the permanently chaotic regime studied by Kreilos &amp; Eckhardt (2012). Our three-dimensional model is obtained by restricting the dynamics to the slowest mixed-mode SSM of the edge state. We show that this results in a nonlinear model that accurately reconstructs individual trajectories, representing the entire chaotic attractor and the laminar dynamics simultaneously. In addition, we derive a two-dimensional Poincar\'e map that enables the rapid computation of the periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor.</description>

      <title>Why is distortion inevitable in opinion propagation on social media? Noise induced layer-wised synchronization in Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media as a dominant information propagation platform has intensified scholarly concerns about systemic information distortion,a phenomenon where content undergoes progressive alteration during multi layered transmission. However, existing literature extensively documents distortion patterns, the fundamental mechanisms coupling network architecture with cognitive noise remain poorly quantified. Here, we introduce a novel fractal network with coupled Noise Frustrated Hegselmann Krause (NFHK) framework that systematically disentangles these intertwined factors. By integrating fractal topology analysis with modified bounded confidence dynamics, our model reveals how hierarchical network structures (characterized by scale invariant connectivity patterns) amplify stochastic noise through successive retransmission layers. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, multi agent simulations, and empirical validation of typical retweet cascades, we demonstrate two key phenomena: (i) distortion escalates super linearly with network depth and (ii) peer nodes exhibit emergent layer wise synchronization despite lacking direct connections among themselves and form a number of synchronous groups based on the number of network layers. These findings establish a unified mechanism explaining distortion accumulation in digital ecosystems while challenging conventional "echo chamber" narratives. Our noise frustration protocol can offer actionable insights for policymakers to design topology aware regulatory frameworks. This work bridges complex systems theory with computational social science, providing both a mathematical foundation for distortion analysis and a toolkit for platform governance.</description>

      <title>Globalizing manifold-based reduced models for equations and data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the very few mathematically rigorous nonlinear model reduction methods is the restriction of a dynamical system to a low-dimensional, sufficiently smooth, attracting invariant manifold. Such manifolds are usually found using local polynomial approximations and, hence, are limited by the unknown domains of convergence of their Taylor expansions. To address this limitation, we extend local expansions for invariant manifolds via Pad\'e approximants, which re-express the Taylor expansions as rational functions for broader utility. This approach significantly expands the range of applicability of manifold-reduced models, enabling reduced modeling of global phenomena, such as large-scale oscillations and chaotic attractors of finite element models. We illustrate the power of globalized manifold-based model reduction on several equation-driven and data-driven examples from solid mechanics and fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>
