      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebras, Z-algebra Structure and Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) associated with an arbitrary toroidal algebra g_tor. We show that U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) contains two elliptic quantum algebras associated with a corresponding affine Lie algebra bg as subalgebras. They are analogue of the horizontal and the vertical subalgebras in the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa}(g_tor). A Hopf algebroid structure is introduced as a co-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) using the Drinfeld comultiplication. We also investigate the Z-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) and show that the Z-algebra governs the irreducibility of the level (k(\not=0),l)-infinite dimensional U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor)-modules in the same way as in the elliptic quantum group U_{q,p}(g). As an example, we construct the level (1,l) irreducible representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) for the simply laced gtor. We also construct the level (0,1) representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_N,tor) and discuss a conjecture on its geometric interpretation as an action on the torus equivariant elliptic cohomology of the affine A_{N-1} quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expose the elliptic quantum groups in the Drinfeld realization associated with both the affine Lie algebra \g and the toroidal algebra \g_tor. There the level-0 and level \not=0 representations appear in a unified way so that one can define the vertex operators as intertwining operators of them. The vertex operators are key for many applications such as a derivation of the elliptic weight functions, integral solutions of the (elliptic) q-KZ equation and a formulation of algebraic analysis of the elliptic solvable lattice models. Identifying the elliptic weight functions with the elliptic stable envelopes we make a correspondence between the level-0 representation of the elliptic quantum group and the equivariant elliptic cohomology. We also emphasize a characterization of the elliptic quantum groups as $q$-deformations of the W-algebras.</description>

      <title>Categorification of based modules over the complex representation ring of $S_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex representation rings of finite groups are the fundamental class of fusion rings, categorified by the corresponding fusion categories of complex representations. The category of $\mathbb{Z}_+$-modules of finite rank over such a representation ring is also semisimple.
  In this paper, we classify the irreducible based modules of rank up to 5 over the complex representation ring $r(S_4)$ of the symmetric group $S_4$. Totally 16 inequivalent irreducible based modules are obtained. Based on such a classification result, we further discuss the categorification of based modules over $r(S_4)$ by module categories over the complex representation category ${\rm Rep}(S_4)$ of $S_4$ arisen from projective representations of certain subgroups of $S_4$.</description>

      <title>Multiplication formula for Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multiplication formula of $F$-polynomial of representations of Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials. Since the truncated $q$-characters of some real simple modules over a quantum affine group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ can be expressed in terms of such $F$-polynomials, one can describe the product of two simple modules over $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ using this multiplication formula.</description>

      <title>Filtration of tensor product of local Weyl modules for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tensor product of local Weyl modules for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]$ whose highest weights are multiples of the first and $n^{th}$ fundamental weights. We determine the graded character of these tensor product modules in terms of the graded character of local Weyl modules and prove that these modules admit a filtration whose successive quotients are either truncated Weyl modules or fusion products of Demazure modules. Furthermore, we establish that the truncated Weyl modules appearing as quotients in the filtration of tensor products of local Weyl modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$ are indeed isomorphic to fusion products of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$-modules which establish the independence of a family of fusion product modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$ from the set of its evaluation parameters.</description>

      <title>Khovanov algebras of type B and tensor powers of the natural $\mathrm{OSp}$-representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of projective endofunctors for modules of Khovanov algebras $K$ of type B. In particular we compute the composition factors and the graded layers of the image of a simple module under such a projective functor. We then study variants of such functors for a subquotient $e\tilde{K}e$. Via a comparison of two graded lifts of the Brauer algebra we relate the Khovanov algebra to the Brauer algebra and use this to show that projective functors describe translation functors on representations of the orthosymplectic supergroup $\mathrm{OSp}(r|2n)$. As an application we get a description of the Loewy layers of indecomposable summands in tensor powers of the natural representation of $\mathrm{OSp}(r|2n)$.</description>

      <title>Double extensions of quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebras with degenerate center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the process of symplectic double extensions for Lie superalgebras with degenerate center. The construction is a superization of a recent work by Fischer, and generalize our previous work. We provide a standard model for such double extensions, where the symplectic form is either orthosymplectic or periplectic. Additionally, we show that every double extension is naturally equivalent to either of these two standard types of extensions. Several examples in low dimensions are given to illustrate the concept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the combinatorial invariance conjecture for parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, formulated by Mario Marietti, is equivalent to its restriction to maximal quotients. This equivalence lies at the other extreme in respect to the equivalence, recently proved by Barkley and Gaetz, with the invariance conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, which turns out to be equivalent to the conjecture for maximal quotients.</description>

      <title>A fusion construction of local L-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new conjectural way to calculate the local $L$-factor $L=L_\chi(\pi,\rho,s)$ where $\pi$ is a representation of a $p$-adic group $G$, $\rho$ is an algebraic representation of the dual group $G^{\vee}$ and $\chi$ is an algebraic character of $G$ satisfying a positivity condition.
  A method going back to Godement and Jacquet yields a description of $L$ using as an input a certain space ${\mathcal S}_\rho$ of functions on $G$ depending on $\rho$. A (partly conjectural) description of ${\mathcal S}_\rho$ involving trace of Frobenius functions associated to perverse sheaves on the loop space of a semigroup containing $G$ was developed %by Bouthier, Ngo and Sakellaridis, partly based on an earlier work of Braverman and Kazhdan. Here we propose a different, more general conjectural description of ${\mathcal S}_\rho$: it also refers to trace of Frobenius functions but instead of the loop space of a semi-group we work with the ramified global Grassmannian fibering over the configuration space of points on a global curve defined by Beilinson-Drinfeld and Gaitsgory (a relation between two approaches is discussed in the appendix).
  Our main result asserts validity of our conjectures where $\pi$ is generated by an Iwahori fixed vector: we show that in this case it is compatible with the standard formula for $L$ involving local Langlands correspondence which is known for such representations $\pi$.
  The proof is based on properties of the coherent realization of the affine Hecke category.</description>

      <title>Pr\"ufer modules in filtration categories of semi-bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an associative unitary ring. A brick in the module category $R-Mod$ is a finitely generated module with a division ring as endomorphism ring. Two non-isomorphic bricks $X,Y$ are said to be orthogonal if $Hom(X,Y)=Hom(Y,X)=0$, and a class ${\mathcal X}$ of pairwise orthogonal bricks is called a semi-brick. We consider the full subcategory $Filt({\mathcal X})$ of modules with filtration in ${\mathcal X}$ and show that this category is a wide category.
  Let ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$ be the class of modules $M$ with $Ext^1(X, M)=0$ for all $X\in {\mathcal X}$. Then for each module $Y\in R-Mod$ there exists a ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$-envelope $Y_{{\mathcal X}}(\infty)$ which can be constructed as the direct limit of iterated universal short exact sequences.
  Let now in addition the projective dimension of every $X\in {\mathcal X}$ be lower or equal $1$. Then we call for $Y\in {\mathcal X}$ the ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$-envelope a Pr\"ufer module since they share many properties with Pr\"ufer groups and also with Pr\"ufer modules over tame hereditary algebras. Their endomorphism rings are complete discrete valuation rings and every injective object in $Filt{{\mathcal X}}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of Pr\"ufer modules.
  We apply the toolset to tame hereditary algebras and give an alternative proof for the classification of divisible modules. For wild hereditary algebras we show that they have large classes of semi-bricks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ in terms of cluster variables of type $A_n$. Then we associate a cluster tilted bound symmetric quiver $Q$ of type $A_{2n-1}$ to any seed of a cluster algebra of type $B_n$ and $C_n$. Under this correspondence, cluster variables of type $B_n$ (resp. $C_n$) correspond to orthogonal (resp. symplectic) indecomposable representations of $Q$. We find a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting. We also give a categorical interpretation of the cluster expansion formula in the case of acyclic quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>

Abstract: We study the generalized doubling method for pairs of representations of $G\times GL_k$ where $G$ is a symplectic group, split special orthogonal group or split general spin group. We analyze the poles of the local integrals, and prove that the global completed $L$-function with a cuspidal representation of $GL_k$ twisted by a highly ramified Hecke character is entire. We obtain a new proof of the weak functorial transfer of cuspidal automorphic representations of $G$ to the natural general linear group, which is independent of the trace formula and its prerequisites, by combining our results with the Converse Theorem.</description>

      <title>Why the wavefunction already is an object on space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as an important problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this article it will be shown that the wavefunction already is a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction has no qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in the objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. This will be shown to be true also in Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. This fits naturally in the classification of quantum particles by the representations of the spacetime isometries realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. Once we realize that all quantum experiments take place in space, they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the wavefunction being an object on space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Feigin--Frenkel theorem states that, over the complex numbers, the centre of the universal affine vertex algebra at the critical level is an infinite rank polynomial algebra. The first author and W.~Wang observed that in positive characteristics, the universal affine vertex algebra contains a large central subalgebra known as the $p$-centre. They conjectured that at the critical level the centre should be generated by the Feigin--Frenkel centre and the $p$-centre. In this paper we prove the conjecture for classical simple Lie algebras for $p$ larger than the Coxeter number, and for exceptional Lie algebras in large characteristics. Finally, we give an example which shows that at non-critical level the center is larger than the $p$-centre.</description>

Abstract: The space $ \ft_n = \C^n/\C $ of $n$ points on the line modulo translation has a natural compactification $ \overline \ft_n $ as a matroid Schubert variety. In this space, pairwise distances between points can be infinite; it is natural to imagine points at infinite distance from each other as living on different projective lines. We call such a configuration of points a ``flower curve'', since we picture the projective lines joined into a flower. Within $ \ft_n $, we have the space $ F_n = \C^n \setminus \Delta / \C $ of $ n$ distinct points. We introduce a natural compatification $ \overline F_n $ along with a map $ \overline F_n \rightarrow \overline \ft_n $, whose fibres are products of genus 0 Deligne-Mumford spaces. We show that both $\overline \ft_n$ and $\overline F_n$, are special fibers of $1$-parameter families whose generic fibers are, respectively, Losev-Manin and Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of stable genus $0$ curves with $n+2$ marked points.
  We find combinatorial models for the real loci $ \overline \ft_n(\BR) $ and $ \overline F_n(\BR) $. Using these models, we prove that these spaces are aspherical and that their equivariant fundamental groups are the virtual symmetric group and the virtual cactus groups, respectively. The degeneration of a twisted real form of the Deligne-Mumford space to $\overline F_n(\mathbb{R})$ gives rise to a natural homomorphism from the affine cactus group to the virtual cactus group.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \operatorname{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity.
  Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source.
  We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

      <title>Archimedean Distinguished Representations and Exceptional Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be an archimedean local field and let $E$ be $F\times F$ (resp. a quadratic extension of $F$). We prove that an irreducible generic (resp. nearly tempered) representation of $\operatorname{GL}_n(E)$ is $\operatorname{GL}_n(F)$ distinguished if and only if its Rankin-Selberg (resp. Asai) $L$-function has an exceptional pole of level zero at $0$. Further, we deduce a necessary condition for the ramification of such representations using the theory of weak test vectors developed by Humphries and Jo.</description>

      <title>Integral structures in smooth $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-representations and zeta integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10870v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an odd prime $p$ and an unramified maximal torus $H $ of $\mathrm{GL}_{2/\mathbf{Q}_p}$, inspired by work of Loeffler-Skinner-Zerbes, we construct natural $H(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-stable lattices in spaces of functions on $\left(\mathrm{GL}_2\times H\right)(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ and positively answer a conjecture of Loeffler. These local lattices give rise to canonical Hecke operators in local spherical Hecke algebras, that enjoy certain integrality properties away from $p$, with respect to equivariant maps into any smooth $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Q}_p)$-representation. In the process, we also obtain integral results on $H$-invariant periods for local unramified Whittaker type representations, and global automorphic representations attached to cuspidal Hecke eigenforms.</description>
