      <title>A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Plancherel-P\'{o}lya's Type of Instability in Vibration System with Multiple Frozen Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of the inverse spectral problem of Sturm-Liouville operator with multiple frozen arguments at $\{a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots,a_{N}\}$ in $(0,\pi)$. One may consider the characteristic functions as perturbation of sine or of cosine functions depending on the boundary problem prescribed. However, such perturbation is represented in the form of Fourier transform of certain function which may or may not bring in Riesz basis theory and classical perturbation theory in functional analysis. We shall demonstrate the spectral perturbation in Plancherel-P\'{o}lya's type of inequality and connect to perturbation of related potential functions in $L^{2}$-functional norm.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Inverse Spectral Problem of Non-Local Sturm-Liouville Operators on Star Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inverse spectral problem of Sturm-Liouville operator on a star-like graph. To this fixed star-like graph centered at the origin as its vertex, we attach $m$ edges. On each edge, we impose the Sturm-Liouville operator with certain non-local potential functions with some suitable non-local boundary value conditions. At the vertex, we consider a frozen argument type of condition at zero to model a network that fixed on the end of each edge on the graph. The vibration and flow changes are monitored at that vertex which serves as certain control center. There is an inverse uniqueness subject to the suitable non-local boundary condition. We show that the system is solvable. Additionally, we give a Weyl's type of spectral asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Existence of Bulk Vortices in Superconductors with Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vortex formation in extreme type-II superconductors immersed in strong magnetic fields in the framework of the the Ginzburg-Landau theory. We focus on the regime where superconductivity survives in the bulk of the material but the magnetic field penetrates the sample, i.e., for applied field much larger than the first critical one, but below the transition to surface superconductivity. Through a two-scale vortex construction, we obtain precise estimates for the vortex distribution and prove the existence of isolated defects with non-trivial winding numbers. In this respect, our work provides the first rigorous mathematical proof of the existence of isolated vortices for fields comparable to the second critical one.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization by Paths -- Part I: The Simply Connected Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any connected and simply connected parasymplectic space $(\mathrm{X},\omega)$ with group of periods $\mathrm{P}_\omega \subsetneq \mathbf{R}$, we construct a prequantum groupoid $\pmb{\mathrm{T}}_\omega$ as a diffeological quotient of the space $\mathrm{Paths}(\mathrm{X})$ of paths in $\mathrm{X}$. This object, built from the geometry of the classical system, serves as a unified structure for prequantization. The groupoid $\pmb{\mathrm{T}}_\omega$ has $\mathrm{X}$ as its objects, and its space of morphisms $\mathcal{Y}$ carries a canonical left-right invariant $1$-form $\pmb{\lambda}$ whose curvature encodes $\omega$. A key property is that the isotropy group $\pmb{\mathrm{T}}_{\omega,x}$ at any point $x$, naturally arising as a quotient of the space of loops, is isomorphic to the torus of periods $\mathrm{T}_\omega = \mathbf{R}/\mathrm{P}_\omega$. Furthermore, the entire symmetry group $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathrm{X}, \omega)$ acts as faithful automorphisms of $(\pmb{\mathrm{T}}_\omega, \pmb{\lambda})$ without central extensions at this level. Built within the framework of diffeology, this construction generalizes classical prequantization by applying to broad classes of spaces, including those with singularities or infinite-dimensional aspects, and by accommodating generalized (e.g., irrational) tori of periods. This paper focuses on the simply connected case; the construction will be extended to general diffeological spaces in a subsequent publication.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal pairs of Euler elements I. Classification, fundamental groups and twisted duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current article continues our project
  on representation theory, Euler elements, causal homogeneous spaces and
  Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT).
  We call a pair (h,k) of Euler elements
  orthogonal if $e^{\pi i \ad h} k = -k$.
  We show that, if (h,k) and (k,h) are orthogonal, then
  they generate a 3-dimensional simple subalgebra.
  We also classify orthogonal Euler pairs in simple Lie algebras
  and determine the fundamental groups of adjoint Euler elements
  in arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
  Causal complements of wedge regions in spacetimes
  can be related to so-called
  twisted complements in the space
  of abstract Euler wedges, defined in purely group theoretic terms.
  We show that any pair of twisted complements can be connected
  by a chain of successive complements coming from $3$-dimensional subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of a nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (MMT model)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (MMT model). We investigate the effect of the nonlocal operator appearing in the nonlinearity on the long-term behavior of solutions, and we identify the conditions under which the solutions of the Cauchy problem associated with this equation is bounded globally in time in the energy space. We also explore the dynamical behavior of standing wave solutions. Therefore, we first numerically generate standing wave solutions of nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation by using the Petviashvili's iteration method and their stability is investigated by the split-step Fourier method. This equation also has a two-parameter family of standing wave solutions. In a second step, we meticulously concern with the construction and stability of a two-parameter family of standing wave solutions numerically. Finally, we investigate the semi-classical limit of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in both focusing and defocusing cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Klein-Gordon field theory in $(D+1)$ dimensions in the presence of a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanar $\delta$-like potential that couples quadratically to the field derivatives. This model effectively generalizes the Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field on the plane, as it reduces to this condition in an appropriate limit of the coupling parameter. Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the Feynman propagator induced by the planar potential and analyze the interaction energy between a stationary point-like source and the potential, obtaining a general and exact expression. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions relating the field mass and the coupling constant to the external potential, the vacuum state becomes unstable, giving rise to a pair-creation phenomenon that resembles the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation exponents of the open KPZ equation in the maximal current phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the open KPZ equation $H(x,t)$ on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann boundary conditions depending on parameters $u,v\ge 0$ (the so-called maximal current phase). For $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ and stationary initial conditions, we obtain matching upper and lower bounds on the variance of the height function $H(0,t)$ for $\alpha \in [0,\frac23]$. Our proof combines techniques from arXiv:2111.03650, which treated the periodic KPZ equation, with Gibbsian line ensemble methods based on the probabilistic structure of the stationary measures developed in arXiv:2103.12253, arXiv:2105.15178, arXiv:2105.03946, arXiv:2306.05983, arXiv:2404.13444.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Detailed Analyses for DC readout and a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum expectation value and the stationary noise spectral density for a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector with a DC readout scheme are discussed in detail only through the quantum electrodynamics of lasers and the Heisenberg equations of mirrors' motion. We demonstrate that the initial conditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency of the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest. Although in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the laser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density decreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral density shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser power is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation pressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the classical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme. Since the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a classical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium point of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must consider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in equilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is incomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this incompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror displacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover the near ideal case.</description>

      <title>Stability of Inverse Resonance Problem on the Half Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse resonance problem in one-dimensional scattering theory. The scattering matrix consists of $2\times 2$ entries of meromorphic functions, which are quotients of certain Fourier transform. The resonances are expressed as the zeros of Fourier transform of wave field. For compactly-supported perturbation, we are able to quantitatively estimate the zeros and poles of each meromorphic entry. The size of potential support is connected to the zero distribution of scattered wave field. We derive the inverse stability on scattering source based on certain knowledge on the perturbation theory of resonances. When the resonances are distributed regularly, there is certain natural stability through the value distribution theory.</description>

      <title>Optically Controlled Skyrmion Number Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to control the motion of magnetic Skyrmions through the generation of a Skyrmion number current. This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend solely on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control.</description>

      <title>The invariance and non-decreasing expectation of an evolutionary path characteristic under weak selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection states that the rate of change in a population's mean fitness equals its additive genetic variance in fitness. This implies that mean fitness should not decline in a constant environment, thereby positioning it as an indicator of evolutionary progression. However, this theorem has been shown to lack universality. Here, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation that describes the stochastic frequency dynamics of two phenotypes in a large population under weak selection and genetic drift, and develop a path integral formulation that characterizes the probability density of phenotypic frequency. Our formulation identifies that, under both selection and genetic drift, the ratio of the probability density of adaptive traits (e.g., phenotypic frequency) to that under neutrality represents a time-invariant evolutionary path characteristic. This ratio quantifies the cumulative effect of directional selection on the evolutionary process compared to genetic drift. Importantly, the expected value of this ratio does not decline over time. In the presence of fitness variance, the effect of directional selection on expected phenotypic changes accumulates over time, diverging progressively from paths shaped solely by genetic drift. The expectation of this time-invariant ratio thus offers a robust and informative alternative to mean fitness as a measure of progression in stochastic evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inertial Kuramoto model, which is a second-order extension of the classical first-order Kuramoto model, as an inertial perturbation of the first-order Kuramoto model. We develop a quantitative Tikhonov theorem, from which we derive a new synchronization statement in the small inertia regime, with strong bounds on the limiting order parameter. We also explore the determinability of phase velocities from phase positions, which shows that the perturbation viewpoint must be limited to the small inertia regime. This paper complements our recent work (2025), where we established asymptotic phase-locking of inertial Kuramoto oscillators under generic initial conditions in the low inertia-high coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Non-intersecting Brownian Motions and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics with root and jump type singularities in space-time under the law of the stationary Hermitian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which serve as a dynamical generalization of earlier static results obtained by Riemann-Hilbert methods. This extends previous asymptotics by [Krasovsky 2007], [Its, Krasovsky 2008], and [Charlier 2019]. As a consequence, fractional powers of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of this process (and the exponential eigenvalues counting process) converge to a two dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure on an infinite strip in the subcritical phase. The dynamical Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics also provide the leading order of the log-characteristic polynomial, together with optimal bulk rigidity for non-intersecting Brownian motions. These results offer (i) the second connection between random matrix theory and Liouville quantum gravity measures after [Bourgade, Falconet 2025], by proving a dynamical generalization of the single-time convergence to the GMC from [Berestycki, Webb, Wong 2018], (ii) a dynamical extension of the maximum of the log-characteristic polynomial [Lambert, Paquette 2019] and the optimal rigidity [Claeys, Fahs, Lambert, Webb 2021].</description>

      <title>Kinematic flow from the flow of cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wavefunction coefficients of conformally coupled scalars in power-law FRW cosmologies satisfy differential equations governed by a set of simple combinatorial rules known as the kinematic flow. In this paper we derive the kinematic flow, expressed using a set of differential forms referred to as the cut basis, from a geometric perspective, relying solely on the cosmological hyperplane arrangement and without invoking bulk physics. Each element of the cut basis corresponds to the positive geometry associated to an independent cut of the physical FRW-form and can be labeled by decorating (minors of) the truncated Feynman graph with an acyclic orientation. We provide a straightforward prescription to associate a logarithmic differential form to each element of the cut basis by considering its corresponding decorated graph. Moreover, we show that the residues of the physical FRW-form are canonical forms of certain graphical zonotopes labeled by the same set of decorated graphs. These zonotopes control the cut combinatorics -- flow of cuts -- of the physical FRW-form and the cut basis (by construction). Using the theory of relative twisted cohomology and intersection theory, we derive a closed form formula for the differential equations of the cut basis. We also introduce combinatorial rules that compute the kinematic differential of any basis element without explicit calculation. The combinatorics of our differential equations is a natural consequence of the flow of cuts and is equivalent (up to rescaling) to the kinematic flow for the recently studied time integral basis. In particular, our differential equations decouple into exponentially many sectors, one for each way of cutting a subset of edges of the graph.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations and Coexistence of Vortices and Antivortices in Generalized Abelian Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Weight Shifting Operators and Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.07813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of conformally-covariant differential operators and a crossing equation that they obey. Together, these tools dramatically simplify calculations involving operators with spin in conformal field theories. As an application, we derive a formula for a general conformal block (with arbitrary internal and external representations) in terms of derivatives of blocks for external scalars. In particular, our formula gives new expressions for "seed conformal blocks" in 3d and 4d CFTs. We also find simple derivations of identities between external-scalar blocks with different dimensions and internal spins. We comment on additional applications, including derivation of recursion relations for general conformal blocks, reducing inversion formulae for spinning operators to inversion formulae for scalars, and deriving identities between general 6j symbols (Racah-Wigner coefficients/"crossing kernels") of the conformal group.</description>

      <title>Maximal free energy of the log-gamma polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a phase transition for the law of large numbers and fluctuations of $\mathsf F_N$, the maximum of the free energy of the log-gamma directed polymer with parameter $\theta$, maximized over all possible starting and ending points in an $N\times N$ square. In particular, we find an explicit critical value $\theta_c=2\Psi^{-1}(0)&gt;0$ ($\Psi$ is the digamma function) such that:
  1. For $\theta&lt;\theta_c$, $\mathsf F_N+2\Psi(\theta/2)N$ has order $N^{1/3}$ GUE Tracy-Widom fluctuations.
  2. For $\theta=\theta_c$, $\mathsf F_N= \Theta(N^{1/3}(\log N)^{2/3})$.
  3. For $\theta&gt;\theta_c$, $\mathsf F_N=\Theta(\log N)$.
  Using a connection between the log-gamma polymer and a certain random operator on the honeycomb lattice, recently found by Kotowski and Vir\'ag (Commun. Math. Phys. 370, 2019), we deduce a similar phase transition for the asymptotic behavior of the smallest positive eigenvalue of the aforementioned random operator.</description>

      <title>Grand-canonical Thermodynamic Formalism via IFS: volume, temperature, gas pressure and grand-canonical topological pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider here a dynamic model for a gas in which a variable number of particles $N \in \mathbb{N}_0 := \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ can be located at a site. This point of view leads us to the grand-canonical framework and the need for a chemical potential. The dynamics is played by the shift acting on the set of sequences $\Omega := \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$, where the alphabet is $\mathcal{A} := \{1,2,...,r\}$. Introducing new variables like the number of particles $N$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, we adapt the concept of grand-canonical partition sum of thermodynamics of gases to a symbolic dynamical setting considering a Lipschitz family of potentials $% (A_N)_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0}$, $A_N:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. Our main results will be obtained from adapting well-known properties of the Thermodynamic Formalism for IFS with weights to our setting. In this direction, we introduce the grand-canonical-Ruelle operator: $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f)=g$, when, $\beta&gt;0,\mu&lt;0,$ and
  \medskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,g(x)= \mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f) (x) =\sum_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0} e^{\beta \, \mu\, N }\, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} e^{- \,\beta\, A_N(jx)} f(jx). $ \medskip
  We show the existence of the main eigenvalue, an associated eigenfunction, and an eigenprobability for $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}^*$. We can show the analytic dependence of the eigenvalue on the grand-canonical potential. Considering the concept of entropy for holonomic probabilities on $\Omega\times \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$, we relate these items with the variational problem of maximizing grand-canonical pressure. In another direction, in the appendix, we briefly digress on a possible interpretation of the concept of topological pressure as related to the gas pressure of gas thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>
