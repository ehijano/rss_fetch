      <title>Discontinuous stochastic forcing in Greenland ice core data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paleoclimate proxy records from Greenland ice cores, archiving e.g. $\delta^{18}$O as a proxy for surface temperature, show that sudden climatic shifts called Dansgaard-Oeschger events (DO) occurred repeatedly during the last glacial interval. They comprised substantial warming of the Arctic region from cold to milder conditions. Concomitant abrupt changes in the dust concentrations of the same ice cores suggest that sudden reorganisations of the hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulation have accompanied the warming events. Genuine bistability of the North Atlantic climate system is commonly hypothesised to explain the existence of stadial (cold) and interstadial (milder) periods in Greenland. However, the physical mechanisms that drove abrupt transitions from the stadial to the interstadial state, and more gradual yet still abrupt reverse transitions, remain debated. Here, we conduct a one-dimensional data-driven analysis of the Greenland temperature and atmospheric circulation proxies under the purview of stochastic processes. We take the Kramers-Moyal equation to estimate each proxy's drift and diffusion terms within a Markovian model framework. We then assess noise contributions beyond Gaussian white noise. The resulting stochastic differential equation (SDE) models feature a monostable drift for the Greenland temperature proxy and a bistable one for the atmospheric circulation proxy. Indicators of discontinuity in stochastic processes suggest to include higher-order terms of the Kramers-Moyal equation when modelling the Greenland temperature proxy's evolution. This constitutes a qualitative difference in the characteristics of the two time series, which should be further investigated from the standpoint of climate dynamics.</description>

      <title>WaveDiffusion: Exploring Full Waveform Inversion via Joint Diffusion in the Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) reconstructs high-resolution subsurface velocity maps from seismic waveform data governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional machine learning approaches frame FWI as an image-to-image translation task, mapping seismic data to velocity maps via encoder-decoder architectures. In this paper, we revisit FWI from a new perspective: generating both modalities simultaneously. We found that both modalities can be jointly generated from a shared latent space using a diffusion process. Remarkably, our jointly generated seismic-velocity pairs inherently satisfy the governing PDE without requiring additional constraints. This reveals an interesting insight: the diffusion process inherently learns a scoring mechanism in the latent space, quantifying the deviation from the governing PDE. Specifically, the generated seismic-velocity pairs with higher scores are closer to the solutions of the governing PDEs. Our experiments on the OpenFWI dataset demonstrate that the generated seismic-velocity pairs not only yield high fidelity, diversity and physical consistency, but also can serve as effective augmentation for training data-driven FWI models.</description>
