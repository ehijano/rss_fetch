      <title>Undulating patterns of Hysteresis loops in diurnal seasonality of air temperature in Urban Heat Island effect: Insights from Paris and Madrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the urban heat island (UHI) effect by conducting a comparative analysis of air temperature hysteresis patterns in Paris and Madrid, two major European cities with distinct climatic and urban characteristics. Utilizing high-resolution modelled air temperature data aggregated at a fine temporal resolution of three-hour intervals from 2008 to 2017, we investigate how diurnal and seasonal hysteresis loops reveal both unique and universal aspects of UHI variability. Paris, located in a temperate oceanic climate, and Madrid, situated in a cold semi-arid zone, display pronounced differences in UHI intensity, seasonal distribution, and diurnal patterns. Despite these contrasts, both cities exhibit remarkably similar hysteresis loop directions and slopes, suggesting that time-dependent mechanisms such as solar radiation and heat storage fundamentally govern air temperature UHI across diverse urban contexts. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both local climate and universal physical processes in developing targeted, climate-resilient urban strategies. The results pave the way for group-based interventions and classification of cities by hysteresis patterns to inform urban planning and heat mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>The Making of a Community Dark Matter Dataset with the National Science Data Fabric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is believed to constitute approximately 85 percent of the universes matter, yet its fundamental nature remains elusive. Direct detection experiments, though globally deployed, generate data that is often locked within custom formats and non-reproducible software stacks, limiting interdisciplinary analysis and innovation. This paper presents a collaboration between the National Science Data Fabric (NSDF) and dark matter researchers to improve accessibility, usability, and scientific value of a calibration dataset collected with Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) detectors at the University of Minnesota. We describe how NSDF services were used to convert data from a proprietary format into an open, multi-resolution IDX structure; develop a web-based dashboard for easily viewing signals; and release a Python-compatible CLI to support scalable workflows and machine learning applications. These contributions enable broader use of high-value dark matter datasets, lower the barrier to entry for new collaborators, and support reproducible, cross-disciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>
