      <title>A pedagogical derivation of the first-order effective Hamiltonian for the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a pedagogical and self-contained derivation of the first-order effective Hamiltonian for the two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model in the dispersive regime. A perturbative unitary transformation removes nonresonant atom-field terms, revealing dispersive frequency shifts leading to an atom-induced effective beam-splitter interaction between the field modes. The resulting Hamiltonian is diagonalized through a simple geometric rotation in the two-mode bosonic space, providing a transparent interpretation of the underlying dynamics. The exposition emphasized clarity and physical insight, making effective Hamiltonian methods accessible for teaching and learning in multimode light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Physics Computational Literacy: Programming, modeling and collaboration at the journeyman level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation has become an integral part of physics research. However, little is known about how students learn to productively use computation as a tool beyond the introductory level, especially as they transition into physics research. In this study, we apply the theory of physics computational literacy and the novice-expert framework to describe the development of expertise in computational physics, as students transition from novice to journeyman computational physicists. We base this description on a thematic analysis of interviews with 13 computational physics master's students with extensive experience using computation. We first describe the most important elements driving the development of computational physics expertise, identifying two distinct transitions of competence during their studies, driven by experience with large computational projects and professional research. We then present an overview of the various skills students attain on this path toward the journeyman level of computational physics expertise. Based on these results, we argue for the need to assist students in collaborative coding and in the learning of new tools, as well as for the importance of large, scaffolded, computational projects in helping students develop the advanced skills needed for computational research.</description>

      <title>Teaching light absorption and the Beer-Lambert law using everyday materials: a tomato juice experiment for introductory physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I describe a visually engaging experiment to demonstrate the Beer-Lambert law in introductory physics or general science courses. By using diluted tomato juice as a naturally colored absorber and a halogen lamp as a broadband light source, students can explore how light attenuation depends on concentration and wavelength. The activity connects the optical concept of exponential absorption with everyday materials, making it accessible for classrooms with limited resources. Transmission spectra obtained with a compact spectrometer reveal a strong absorption band around 500 nm, corresponding to the green-blue region absorbed by lycopene. Plotting absorbance against concentration allows students to confirm linear behavior at low concentrations and to discuss deviations at higher ones. The experiment emphasizes conceptual understanding of light-matter interaction, quantitative data analysis, and the limitations of ideal laws, providing a memorable learning experience in optics and spectroscopy.</description>
