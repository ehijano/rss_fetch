      <title>HIV/AIDS Suppression in North America: Intervention Plans and Cost-Effectiveness of UNAIDS 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes mathematical models to assess progress toward achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 and 95-95-95 targets aimed at managing and eradicating HIV/AIDS. It contrasts stochastic and deterministic models, focusing on their utility in optimizing public health strategies. Stochastic models account for real-world unpredictability, offering more realistic insights compared to deterministic approaches. The 95-95-95 targets aim for 95\% of people living with HIV to know their status, 95\% of those diagnosed to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95\% of those on ART to achieve viral suppression. These benchmarks are critical for reducing transmission and improving health outcomes. This analysis establishes the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) to guide interventions and examines the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria, providing a foundation for applying optimal control strategies to minimize HIV prevalence effectively and cost-efficiently. Moreover, the data for this study was sourced from the official UNAIDS website, focusing on North America. An innovative feature of this study is the application of the Stochastic method, which enhances model accuracy and operational efficiency in simulating HIV transmission under various interventions. This research offers actionable insights for policymakers and contributes to global efforts to achieve the 95-95-95 targets by 2030, advancing the fight against HIV/AIDS.</description>

      <title>Slowing translation to avoid ribosome population extinction and maintain stable allocation at slow growth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To double the cellular population of ribosomes, a fraction of the active ribosomes is allocated to synthesize ribosomal proteins. Subsequently, these ribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new ribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle. Neglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the doubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of ribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its synthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly process has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to decrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the decline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely through controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal proteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential ribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the production rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the actual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this regime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as an alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow growth rates with a larger ribosome pool. We clarify the observed reduction in translation speed at harsh environments in E. coli and C. Glutamicum, explore other mitigation strategies, and suggest additional falsifiable predictions of our model.</description>

      <title>Comorbidity Patterns and Temporal Associations of Multiple Long-Term Conditions in Adults with Intellectual Disability: an observational study in the United Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: To examine the distribution, temporal associations, and age/sex-specific patterns of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) in adults with intellectual disability (ID).
  Study Design: Observational study using longitudinal healthcare data. Methods: Analysis of 18144 adults with ID (10168 males and 7976 females) identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data (2000-2021). We used temporal analysis to establish directional associations among 40 long-term conditions, stratified by sex and age groups (under 45, 45-64, 65 and over).
  Results: The high prevalence of enduring mental illness across all age groups is an important finding unique to this population. In males, mental illness occurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux disorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux disorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems. Among young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral palsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia represents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset of lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these conditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those in the general population. The health conditions in those aged 65 and over largely mirrored those seen in the general aging population.
  Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex patterns of MLTCs in this population, revealing sex-specific associations across age groups, and identified temporal associations, thus providing insights into disease progression, which can inform targeted prevention strategies and interventions to prevent premature mortality.</description>
