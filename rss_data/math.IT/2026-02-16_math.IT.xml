      <title>Channel Gain Map Reconstruction Based on Virtual Scatterer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for modeling and reconstructing the channel gain map (CGM) based on virtual scatterers. Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming for ISAC Systems Under Communication Eavesdropper and Sensing Eavesdropper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to great efficiency improvement in resource and hardware space, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained much attention. In the paper, the physical layer security (PLS) of ISAC system under communication eavesdropper together with sensing eavesdropper is investigated. The system secrecy rate is maximized by transmit beamforming design of communication and sensing signals when taking sensing security, sensing performance and transmit power constraint into consideration. To deal with the formulated non-convex optimization problem, the successive convex approximation (SCA) together with the first-order Taylor expansion and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized. Additionally, it is theoretically validated that the SDR does not yield sub-optimality in the paper. Thereafter, an iterated joint secure beamforming algorithm against communication and sensing eavesdroppers is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Capacity Analysis and Beamforming Optimization for MIMO-VLC Wiretap Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) wiretap channel consisting of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, and an eavesdropper. The optical input is subject to both peakand average-intensity constraints. By applying the generalized entropy-power inequality to truncated exponential inputs, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the achievable secrecy rate for general MIMO VLC configurations. To enhance transmission confidentiality, a fully-connected beamforming scheme is proposed, along with a low-complexity sub-connected alternative. Although the resulting beamforming design problems are nonconvex, they are efficiently addressed by transforming them into a sequence of convex subproblems solvable via the successive convex approximation framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve significant secrecy performance improvements compared with the benchmark scheme.</description>

      <title>Construction of MRD Codes Based on Circular-Shift Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most well-known constructions of $(N \times n, q^{Nk}, d)$ maximum rank distance (MRD) codes rely on the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^N}$, whose increasing complexity with larger $N$ hinders parameter selection and practical implementation. In this work, based on circular-shift operations, we present a construction of $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD codes with efficient encoding, where $J$ equals to the Euler's totient function of a defined $L$ subject to $\gcd(q, L) = 1$. The proposed construction is performed entirely over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and avoids the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^J}$. We further characterize the constructed MRD codes, Gabidulin codes and twisted Gabidulin codes using a set of $q$-linearized polynomials over the row vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^N$, and clarify their inherent difference and connection. For the case $J \neq m_L$, where $m_L$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $L$, we show that the proposed MRD codes, in a family of settings, are different from any Gabidulin code and any twisted Gabidulin code. For the case $J = m_L$, we prove that every constructed $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD code coincides with a $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ Gabidulin code, yielding an equivalent circular-shift-based construction that operates directly over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we prove that under some parameter settings, the constructed MRD codes are equivalent to a generalization of Gabidulin codes obtained by summing and concatenating several $(m_L \times n, q^{m_Lk}, d)$ Gabidulin codes. When $q=2$, $L$ is prime and $n\leq m_L$, it is analyzed that generating a codeword of the proposed $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ MRD codes requires $O(nkL)$ exclusive OR (XOR) operations, while generating a codeword of $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ Gabidulin codes, based on customary construction, requires $O(nkL^2)$ XOR operations.</description>

      <title>FPNet: Joint Wi-Fi Beamforming Matrix Feedback and Anomaly-Aware Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed description of the wireless channel and has been widely adopted for Wi-Fi sensing, particularly for high-precision indoor positioning. However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.</description>

      <title>Concatenated Codes for Short-Molecule DNA Storage with Sequencing Channels of Positive Zero-Undetected-Error Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the amount of reliable information that can be stored in a DNA-based storage system with noisy sequencing, where each codeword is composed of short DNA molecules. We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.</description>

      <title>EARL: Energy-Aware Adaptive Antenna Control with Reinforcement Learning in O-RAN Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) promises uniform high performance across the network, but also brings a high energy cost due to joint transmission from distributed radio units (RUs) and centralized processing in the cloud. Leveraging the resource-sharing capabilities of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), we propose EARL, an energy-aware adaptive antenna control framework based on reinforcement learning. EARL dynamically configures antenna elements in RUs to minimize radio, optical fronthaul, and cloud processing power consumption while meeting user spectral efficiency demands. Numerical results show power savings of up to 81% and 50% over full-on and heuristic baselines, respectively. The RL-based approach operates within 220 ms, satisfying O-RAN's near-real-time limit, and a greedy refinement further halves power consumption at a 2 s runtime.</description>

      <title>Model-Aware Rate-Distortion Limits for Task-Oriented Source Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-Oriented Source Coding (TOSC) has emerged as a paradigm for efficient visual data communication in machine-centric inference systems, where bitrate, latency, and task performance must be jointly optimized under resource constraints. While recent works have proposed rate-distortion bounds for coding for machines, these results often rely on strong assumptions on task identifiability and neglect the impact of deployed task models. In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints. Experiments on standard classification benchmarks confirm that current learned TOSC schemes operate far from these limits, highlighting transmitter-side complexity as a key bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Quantum walk inspired JPEG compression of images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a quantum inspired adaptive quantization framework that enhances the classical JPEG compression by introducing a learned, optimized Qtable derived using a Quantum Walk Inspired Optimization (QWIO) search strategy. The optimizer searches a continuous parameter space of frequency band scaling factors under a unified rate distortion objective that jointly considers reconstruction fidelity and compression efficiency. The proposed framework is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet subsets, using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Bits Per Pixel (BPP), and error heatmap visual analysis as evaluation metrics. Experimental results show average gains ranging from 3 to 6 dB PSNR, along with better structural preservation of edges, contours, and luminance transitions, without modifying decoder compatibility. The structure remains JPEG compliant and can be implemented using accessible scientific packages making it ideal for deployment and practical research use.</description>

      <title>Resource-Adaptive Teleportation Under Imperfect Entanglement: A Code-Puncturing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.</description>

      <title>Block-Sample MAC-Bayes Generalization Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of novel block-sample MAC-Bayes bounds (mean approximately correct). While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\mathcal{O}(1/\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of intersecting error-correcting codes, with a particular focus on their connection to matroid theory. We establish properties and bounds for intersecting codes with the Hamming metric and illustrate how these distinguish the subfamily of minimal codes within the family of intersecting codes. We prove that the property of a code being intersecting is characterized by the matroid-theoretic notion of vertical connectivity, showing that intersecting codes are precisely those achieving the highest possible value of this parameter. We then introduce the concept of vertical connectivity for $q$-matroids and link it to the theory of intersecting codes endowed with the rank metric.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on AI-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) can help overcome the challenges of limited spectrum and expensive hardware, leading to improved energy and cost efficiency. While full cooperation between sensing and communication can result in significant performance gains, achieving optimal performance requires efficient designs of unified waveforms and beamformers for joint sensing and communication. Sophisticated statistical signal processing and multi-objective optimization techniques are necessary to balance the competing design requirements of joint sensing and communication tasks. As model-based approaches can be suboptimal or too complex, deep learning offers a powerful data-driven alternative, especially when optimal algorithms are unknown or impractical for real-time use. Unified waveform and beamformer design problems for ISAC fall into this category, where fundamental design trade-offs exist between sensing and communication performance metrics, and the underlying models may be inadequate or incomplete. This tutorial paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency or reduce complexity in ISAC designs. We emphasize the integration benefits through AI-driven ISAC designs, prioritizing the development of unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming strategies for both sensing and communication. To illustrate the practical potential of AI-driven ISAC, we present three case studies on waveform, beamforming, and constellation design, demonstrating how unsupervised learning and neural network-based optimization can effectively balance performance, complexity, and implementation constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between binary even LCD codes and simple graphs whose adjacency matrices are idempotent over $\FF_2$. This bijection preserves equivalence: permutation equivalence of codes corresponds exactly to graph isomorphism. Based on this framework, we characterize which distance-regular graphs yield LCD codes via intersection array parameters, prove that non-isomorphic conference graphs yield inequivalent codes, and classify LCD-derived graphs of small orders.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. Here we study two fundamental tasks in the processing of entanglement: entanglement testing, which is a quantum state discrimination problem concerned with entanglement detection in the many-copy regime, and entanglement distillation, concerned with purifying entanglement from noisy entangled states. We introduce a way of benchmarking the performance of distillation that focuses on the best achievable error rather than its yield in the asymptotic limit. When the underlying set of operations used for entanglement distillation is the axiomatic class of non-entangling operations, we show that the two figures of merit for entanglement testing and distillation coincide. We solve both problems by proving a generalised quantum Sanov's theorem, enabling the exact evaluation of asymptotic error rates of composite quantum hypothesis testing. We show in particular that the asymptotic figure of merit is given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state -- a distinct feature among measures of entanglement that quantify the optimal performance of information-theoretic tasks.</description>

      <title>p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Parametrized complexity of relations between multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the parametrized complexity of fundamental relations between multidimensional subshifts, such as equality, conjugacy, inclusion, and embedding, for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and effective subshifts. We build on previous work of E. Jeandel and P. Vanier on the complexity of these relations as two-input problems, by fixing one subshift as parameter and taking the other subshift as input. We study the impact of various dynamical properties related to periodicity, minimality, finite type, etc. on the computational properties of the parameter subshift, which reveals interesting differences and asymmetries.
  Among other notable results, we find choices of parameter that reach the maximum difficulty for each problem; we find nontrivial decidable problems for multidimensional SFT, where most properties are undecidable; and we find connections with recent work relating having computable language and being minimal for some property, showing in particular that this property may not always be chosen conjugacy-invariant.</description>

      <title>Human- vs. AI-generated tests: dimensionality and information accuracy in latent trait evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in social and psychological research. Among potential applications, LLMs can be used to generate, customise, or adapt measurement instruments. This study presents a preliminary investigation of AI-generated questionnaires by comparing two ChatGPT-based adaptations of the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) with the validated human-developed version. The AI instruments were designed with different levels of explicitness in content and instructions on construct facets, and their psychometric properties were assessed using a Bayesian Graded Response Model. Results show that although surface wording between AI and original items was similar, differences emerged in dimensionality and in the distribution of item and test information across latent traits. These findings illustrate the importance of applying statistical measures of accuracy to ensure the validity and interpretability of AI-driven tools.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Regularized Inference: A Predictive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive inference requires balancing statistical accuracy against informational complexity, yet the choice of complexity measure is usually imposed rather than derived. We treat econometric objects as predictive rules, mappings from information to reported predictive distributions, and impose three structural requirements on evaluation: locality, strict propriety, and coherence under aggregation (coarsening/refinement) of outcome categories. These axioms characterize (uniquely, up to affine transformations) the logarithmic score and induce Shannon mutual information (Kullback-Leibler divergence) as the corresponding measure of predictive complexity. The resulting entropy-regularized prediction problem admits Gibbs-form optimal rules, and we establish an essentially complete-class result for the admissible rules we study under joint risk-complexity dominance. Rational inattention emerges as the constrained dual, corresponding to frontier points with binding information capacity. The entropy penalty contributes additive curvature to the predictive criterion; in weakly identified settings, such as weak instruments in IV regression, where the unregularized objective is flat, this curvature stabilizes the predictive criterion. We derive a local quadratic (LAQ) expansion connecting entropy regularization to classical weak-identification diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Throughput: Fundamental Limits of Attention-Constrained Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent generative and tool-using AI systems can surface a large volume of candidates at low marginal cost, yet only a small fraction can be checked carefully. This creates a decoder-side bottleneck: downstream decision-makers must form reliable posteriors from many public records under scarce attention. We formalize this regime via Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), in which a cheap screening stage processes $K$ records and an expensive verification stage can follow up on at most $B$ of them. Under Bayes log-loss, we study the maximum achievable reduction in posterior uncertainty per window, which we call \emph{epistemic throughput}. Our main result is a ``JaKoB'' scaling law showing that epistemic throughput has a baseline term that grows linearly with verification and prevalence, and an additional \emph{information-leverage} term that scales as $\sqrt{JKB}$, where $J$ summarizes screening quality. Thus, expanding cheap screening can nonlinearly amplify scarce verification, even when informative records are rare. We further show that this scaling is tight in a weak-screening limit, and that in the sparse-verification regime ($B \ll K$), substantial leverage requires heavy-tailed score distributions; for light-tailed scores the amplification is only logarithmic.</description>

      <title>The Critical Horizon: Inspection Design Principles for Multi-Stage Operations and Deep Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing lines, service journeys, supply chains, and AI reasoning chains share a common challenge: attributing a terminal outcome to the intermediate stage that caused it. We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which reliable learning from endpoint data alone requires exponentially many samples. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI.</description>
