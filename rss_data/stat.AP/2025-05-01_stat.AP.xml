      <title>Leveraging Surplus Electricity: Profitability of Bitcoin Mining as a National Strategy in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the feasibility and profitability of utilizing surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining. Surplus electricity refers to the remaining electricity after net metering, which can be repurposed for Bitcoin mining to improve Korea Electric Power Corporation's (KEPCO) energy resource efficiency and alleviate its debt challenges. Net metering (or net energy metering) is an electricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity when they want, rather than when it is produced. Using the latest Bitcoin miner, the Antminer S21 XP Hyd, the study evaluates daily Bitcoin mining when operating at 30,565 and 45,439 units, incorporating Bitcoin network hash rates to assess profitability. To examine profitability, the Random Forest Regressor and Long Short-Term Memory models were used to predict the Bitcoin price. The analysis shows that the use of excess electricity for Bitcoin mining not only generates economic revenue, but also minimizes energy loss, reduces debt, and resolves unsettled payment issues for KEPCO. This study empirically investigates and analyzes the integration of electricity surplus in South Korea with bitcoin mining for the first time. The findings highlight the potential to strengthen the financial stability of KEPCO and demonstrate the feasibility of Bitcoin mining. In addition, this research serves as a foundational resource for future advancements in the Bitcoin mining industry and the efficient use of energy resources.</description>

      <title>Do global forecasting models require frequent retraining?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era of increasing computational capabilities and growing environmental consciousness, organizations face a critical challenge in balancing the accuracy of forecasting models with computational efficiency and sustainability. Global forecasting models, lowering the computational time, have gained significant attention over the years. However, the common practice of retraining these models with new observations raises important questions about the costs of forecasting. Using ten different machine learning and deep learning models, we analyzed various retraining scenarios, ranging from continuous updates to no retraining at all, across two large retail datasets. We showed that less frequent retraining strategies maintain the forecast accuracy while reducing the computational costs, providing a more sustainable approach to large-scale forecasting. We also found that machine learning models are a marginally better choice to reduce the costs of forecasting when coupled with less frequent model retraining strategies as the frequency of the data increases. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that frequent retraining is essential for maintaining forecasting accuracy. Instead, periodic retraining offers a good balance between predictive performance and efficiency, both in the case of point and probabilistic forecasting. These insights provide actionable guidelines for organizations seeking to optimize forecasting pipelines while reducing costs and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>On the Mechanistic Interpretability of Neural Networks for Causality in Bio-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2) discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical, machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Decision-Making for Clinical Assessment of Auto-Segmented Contour Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment (QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds, the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent, transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34 subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more reliable radiotherapy workflows.</description>

      <title>Spatial vertical regression for spatial panel data: Evaluating the effect of the Florentine tramway's first line on commercial vitality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic control methods are commonly used in panel data settings to evaluate the effect of an intervention. In many of these cases, the treated and control units correspond to spatial units such as regions or neighborhoods. Our approach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied at specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic control applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact, the extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects with distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we introduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This innovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying proximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the spatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical regression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian process to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas of different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent, reflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and have similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly pertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction. We study its influence on the local commercial landscape, focusing on how business prevalence varies at different distances from the tram stops.</description>

      <title>Varying coefficients correlated velocity models in complex landscapes with boundaries applied to narwhal responses to noise exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narwhals in the Arctic are increasingly exposed to human activities that can temporarily or permanently threaten their survival by modifying their behavior. We examine GPS data from a population of narwhals exposed to ship and seismic airgun noise during a controlled experiment in 2018 in the Scoresby Sound fjord system in Southeast Greenland. The fjord system has a complex shore line, restricting the behavioral response options for the narwhals to escape the threats. We propose a new continuous-time correlated velocity model with varying coefficients that includes spatial constraints on movement. To assess the sound exposure effect we compare a baseline model for the movement before exposure to a response model for the movement during exposure. Our model, applied to the narwhal data, suggests increased tortuosity of the trajectories as a consequence of the spatial constraints, and further indicates that sound exposure can disturb narwhal motion up to a couple of tens of kilometers. Specifically, we found an increase in velocity and a decrease in the movement persistence.</description>

      <title>While-alive regression analysis of composite survival endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite endpoints, which combine two or more distinct outcomes, are frequently used in clinical trials to enhance the event rate and improve the statistical power. In the recent literature, the while-alive cumulative frequency measure offers a strong alternative to define composite survival outcomes, by relating the average event rate to the survival time. Although non-parametric methods have been proposed for two-sample comparisons between cumulative frequency measures in clinical trials, limited attention has been given to regression methods that directly address time-varying effects in while-alive measures for composite survival outcomes. Motivated by an individually randomized trial (HF-ACTION) and a cluster randomized trial (STRIDE), we address this gap by developing a regression framework for while-alive measures for composite survival outcomes that include a terminal component event. Our regression approach uses splines to model time-varying association between covariates and a while-alive loss rate of all component events, and can be applied to both independent and clustered data. We derive the asymptotic properties of the regression estimator in each setting and evaluate its performance through simulations. Finally, we apply our regression method to analyze data from the HF-ACTION individually randomized trial and the STRIDE cluster randomized trial. The proposed methods are implemented in the WAreg R package.</description>
