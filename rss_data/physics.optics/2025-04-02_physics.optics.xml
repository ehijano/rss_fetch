      <title>Fixed-Attention Mechanism for Deep-Learning-Assisted Design of High-Degree-of-Freedom 3D Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional design approaches for high-degree-of-freedom metamaterials have been computationally intensive and, in many cases, even intractable due to the vast design space. In this work, we introduce a novel fixed-attention mechanism into a deep learning framework to address the computational challenges of metamaterial design. We consider a 3D plasmonic structure composed of gold nanorods characterized by geometric parameters and demonstrate that a Long Short-Term Memory network with a fixed-attention mechanism can improve the prediction accuracy by 48.09% compared to networks without attention. Additionally, we successfully apply this framework for the inverse design of plasmonic metamaterials. Our approach significantly reduces computational costs, opening the door for efficient real-time optimization of complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>High-performance Hybrid Lithium Niobate Electro-optic Modulators Integrated with Low-loss Silicon Nitride Waveguides on a Wafer-scale Silicon Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneously-integrated electro-optic modulators (EOM) are demonstrated using the hybrid-mode concept, incorporating thin-film lithium niobate (LN) by bonding with silicon nitride (SiN) passive photonics. At wavelengths near 1550 nm, these EOMs demonstrated greater than 30 dB extinction ratio, 3.8 dB on-chip insertion loss, a low-frequency half-wave voltage-length product ($V_\pi L$) of 3.8 V.cm, and a 3-dB EO modulation bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz. This work demonstrates the combination of multi-layer low-loss SiN waveguides with high-performance LN EOMs made in a scalable fabrication process using conventional low-resistivity silicon (Si) wafers.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Airy rings wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airy waves, known for their non-diffracting and self-accelerating properties, have been extensively studied in spatial and temporal domains, but their spatiotemporal (ST) counterparts remain largely unexplored. We report the first experimental realization of a spatiotemporal Airy rings wavepacket, which exhibits an Airy function distribution in the radial dimension of the ST domain. The wavepacket demonstrates abrupt autofocusing under the combined effects of diffraction and dispersion, achieving a 110 um spatial and 320 fs temporal focus with a sharp intensity contrast along the propagation direction - ideal for nonlinear microscopy and multiphoton 3D printing. Notably, the wavepacket retains its autofocusing capability even after spatial obstruction, showcasing robust self-healing. Furthermore, by embedding a vortex phase, we create an ST-Airy vortex wavepacket that confines transverse orbital angular momentum (t-OAM) within a compact ST volume, enabling new avenues for studying light-matter interactions with t-OAM. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of ST Airy waves and highlight their potential for transformative applications in ultrafast optics, structured light, and precision laser processing.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Exceptional Points Induced by Non-Markovian Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) have consistently held a central role in non-Hermitian physics due to their unique physical properties and potential applications. They have been intensively explored in parity-time ($\mathcal {P}\mathcal {T}$)-symmetric systems or other non-Hermitian systems; however, they barely investigated in pseudo-Hermitian systems with non-Markovian environments. In this work, we study higher-order EPs in three coupled cavities (denoted as $a$, $b_1$, and $b_2$) under pseudo-Hermitian conditions. Specifically, the cavity $a$ simultaneously interacts with two Markovian environments, while the cavity $b_1$ and $b_2$ couples with the respective Markovian environments. Through coherent perfect absorption (CPA) of two input fields with the cavity $a$, we obtain an effective gain for the system. Under certain parametric conditions, the effective Hamiltonian of the system holds pseudo-Hermiticity, where the third-order exceptional point (EP3) can be observed by measuring the output spectrum of the system. Moreover, we generalize the results to the non-Markovian regimes (only two environments coupling with the cavity $a$ are non-Markovian, while the other two environments coupling with cavities $b_1$ and $b_2$ are Markovian), which leads to the emergence of fourth-order exceptional points (EP4) and fifth-order exceptional points (EP5). In particular, EP4 and EP5 in the non-Markovian limit (corresponding to the infinite spectral width) can return to EP3 under the Markovian approximation. Finally, we extend the systems to more general non-Hermitian ones without pseudo-Hermitian constraints and find the higher-order EPs (EP6 and EP7), where all four environments are non-Markovian. The study presents expansions of non-Hermitian physics into the field of non-Markovian dynamics and anticipates the profound impact in quantum optics and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Tailor-Made Metasurface Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Lamb-dip spectroscopy of rotational levels with UTC-PD terahertz emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe saturation spectroscopy in the sub-terahertz region was performed in the rotational transition (J, K) = (16, 0) &lt;- (15, 0) for gas-phase acetonitrile molecules in the counter-propagating configuration. We observed Lamb-dips at much lower excitation powers than previously reported. The linewidth in the zero-pressure limit was 10 kHz, which was estimated from the intensity and pressure dependence. This corresponds to the transit-time broadening.</description>

      <title>Bismuth plasmonic antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth is a particularly promising alternative plasmonic metal because of its theoretically predicted wide spectral bandwidth. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated the correlation between the shape and size of individual bismuth plasmonic antennas and their optical properties. To this end, we employed a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Bar-shaped and bowtie bismuth plasmonic antennas of various sizes were fabricated by focused ion beam lithography of a polycrystalline bismuth thin film. Our experimental findings demonstrate that these antennas support localised surface plasmon resonances and their dipole modes can be tuned through their size from the near-infrared to the entire visible spectral region. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that bismuth exhibits a plasmon dispersion relation that is nearly identical to that of gold while maintaining its plasmonic performance even at higher plasmon energies, thus rendering it a promising low-cost alternative to gold.</description>

      <title>Online estimation of the transmission matrix of an atmospheric channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of the transmission matrix of a time-evolving atmospheric channel with an online recursive optimization routine, using wave-optics simulations. We demonstrate that this estimation technique is able to keep up with the evolution of the channel and enables a significant improvement of communication-relevant quantities such as the total power transmitted through the channel, and the coupling of the received light into a single mode fiber. Moreover, we show that this approach is robust against measurement noise, and that it notably reduces the probability and duration of power outages, even in strong turbulence.</description>

      <title>Engineering thermal emission with enhanced emissivity and quality factor using bound states in the continuum and electromagnetically-induced absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-based thermal metasurfaces exhibit stable spectral characteristics under temperature fluctuations, in contrast to more traditional gray- and near black-bodies, as well as some dielectric metasurfaces, whose emission spectra shift with changing temperatures. However, they often suffer from limited quality (Q) factors due to significant non-radiative ohmic losses. In this study, we address the challenge of achieving high emissivity and Q-factors in metal-based thermal emitters. By leveraging the coupling between a magnetic dipole resonance and two bound-state-in-continuum (BIC) resonances to achieve electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) in an asymmetric metallic ring structure, we design a metal-based thermal metasurface with a near-unity emissivity (0.96) and a Q factor as high as 320 per simulations. Experimental validation yields an emissivity of 0.82 and a Q factor of 202, representing an approximately five-fold improvement in the experimentally measured Q factor compared to the state-of-the-art metal-based thermal metasurfaces. Our work offers a promising approach for developing efficient, narrow-band, directional thermal emitters with stable emission spectra across a wide temperature range.</description>

      <title>Twisting Light, Steering Spins: Gold Nanoparticle Magnetization via Inverse Faraday and Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to controlling magnetization in gold nanoparticles using the Inverse Faraday Effect combined with Laguerre-Gauss beams carrying orbital angular momentum. By tailoring the tilt of isophase planes, we induce drift photocurrents that generate magnetic fields tilted by up to 25{\deg} relative to the beam axis. The magnetic orientation can be reversed by switching polarization chirality or the orbital angular momentum sign, and it can be rotated azimuthally by repositioning the particle, accessing any angle over 2{\pi} steradians. This unprecedented level of control extends all-optical magnetization to three-dimensional orientations, potentially at ultrafast timescales given the near-instantaneous nature of the Inverse Faraday Effect. Our results pave the way for advanced spin-based applications, from triggering spin waves in magnetic materials to designing next-generation magnetic memory and logic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <title>Continuous time ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensing using ultra-cold Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for detecting ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio fields using a three-photon Rydberg excitation scheme in a continuously laser cooled sample of Rb-87 atoms. By measuring Autler-Townes splitting, we demonstrate resonant detection of UHF fields with frequency range 500-900 MHz through probing F -&gt; G transitions, achieving a lowest minimum detectable field of 2.5(6) mV/cm at 899 MHz. We also demonstrate continuous time detection of a modulated RF signal, with a 3 dB bandwidth of 4.7(4) kHz at a carrier frequency of 899 MHz. Our approach employs atom loss spectroscopy rather than electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which enables detection whilst the atomic sample is simultaneously laser cooled. We investigate this operating regime to determine the feasibility of combining the benefits of reduced thermal dephasing (and subsequent increased sensitivity) of cold atoms with the continuous operation associated with thermal atoms. Our continuous time detection scheme provides an advantage over existing pulsed cold atom systems as we avoid the slow experimental duty cycles typically associated with replenishing the cold atom ensemble. We characterize the excitation scheme by varying laser detunings and analyze the impact and limitations due to various broadening mechanisms on the detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 2: transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second chapter, we analyse transmission problems between a dielectric and a dispersive negative material. In the first part, we consider a transmission problem between two half-spaces, filled respectively by the vacuum and a Drude material, and separated by a planar interface. In this setting, we answer to the following question: does this medium satisfy a limiting amplitude principle? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. In the second part, we consider the transmission problem of an infinite strip of Drude material embedded in the vacuum and analyse the existence and dispersive properties of guided waves. In both problems, our spectral analysis enlighten new and unusual physical phenomena for the considered transmission problems due to the presence of the dispersive negative material. In particular, we prove the existence of an interface resonance in the first part and the existence of slow light phenomena for guiding waves in the second part.</description>

      <title>Microring resonator-based photonic circuit for faithfully heralding NOON states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have designed a Micro-Ring Resonator (MRR) based device that allows for the post-selection of high order NOON states via heralding. NOON states higher than $N=2$ cannot be generated deterministically. By tuning the coupling parameters of the device we can minimize the amplitudes of the 'accidental' states to maximize the probability of obtaining the NOON state upon a successful heralding event. Our device can produce a 3-photon NOON state output with 100% certainty upon a successful heralding detection, which occurs with probability $\frac{8}{27}$ for optimal tunable device parameters. A successful heralding event allows for non-destructive time of flight tracking of the NOON state thus establishing a significantly enhanced level of engineering control for integration of the NOON state into scalable systems for quantum sensing and metrology. We further discuss extensions of our technique to even higher NOON states having $N=4,5$.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 1: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this chapter the mathematical models for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive isotropic passive linear media for which the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$ depend on the frequency. We emphasize the link between physical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular attention is devoted to the notions of causality and passivity and its connection to the existence of Herglotz functions that determine the dispersion of the material. We consider successively the cases of the general passive media and the so-called local media for which $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are rational functions of the frequency. This leads us to analyse the important class of non dissipative and dissipative generalized Lorentz models. In particular, we discuss the connection between mathematical and physical properties of models through the notions of stability, energy conservation, dispersion and modal analyses, group and phase velocities and energy decay in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Driven Transition of Particles from Dispersive to Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) play a crucial role in condensed matter physics, offering an ideal platform to study strong correlation effects and enabling applications in diffraction-free photonics and quantum devices. However, the study and application of FB properties are susceptible to interference from dispersive bands. Here, we explore the impact of bond dissipation on systems hosting both flat and dispersive bands by calculating the steady-state density matrix. We demonstrate that bond dissipation can drive particles from dispersive bands into FBs and establish the general conditions for this phenomenon to occur. Our results demonstrate that dissipation can facilitate FB preparation, property measurement, and utilization. This opens a new avenue for exploring FB physics in open quantum systems, with potential implications for strongly correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Optical surface reflectivity characterization in water Cherenkov detectors: methodologies and industrial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of various components in water Cherenkov (WC) neutrino experiments is essential for accurate detector characterization, which is critical for precise measurements. Of particular importance is the characterization of surface reflectivity within the Cherenkov volume. We present a methodology for surface reflectivity characterization using a goniometer setup, addressing the challenges associated with measurements in the air and water (or other optical media). Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) measurements using a goniometer, including their industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Local-Resonance Induced Complex Band Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complex band hybridization induced by nonreciprocal local resonances in photonic crystals. Composed of trimer unit cells, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetophotonic crystal with an analytically obtainable solution is considered. We find that nonreciprocal spectral gap may appear without nonreciprocal transmission and that the imaginary parts of the complex wavevectors $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ may blow up at resonance to give extreme nonreciprocal transmission. We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</description>

      <title>Unifying and accelerating level-set and density-based topology optimization by subpixel-smoothed projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new "subpixel-smoothed projection" (SSP) formulation for differentiable binarization in topology optimization (TopOpt) as a drop-in replacement for previous projection schemes, which suffer from non-differentiability and/or slow convergence as binarization improves. Our new algorithm overcomes these limitations by depending on both the underlying filtered design field and its spatial gradient, instead of the filtered design field alone. We can now smoothly transition between density-based TopOpt (in which topology can easily change during optimization) and a level-set method (in which shapes evolve in an almost-everywhere binarized structure). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several photonics inverse-design problems and for a variety of computational methods (finite-difference, Fourier-modal, and finite-element methods). SSP exhibits both faster convergence and greater simplicity.</description>

      <title>Hot-electron-injection-induced symmetry breaking in bilayer MoS$_2$ probed by second-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry governs the selection rules of light-matter interactions in crystalline materials, making symmetry manipulation a powerful tool for tuning their optical properties. Here, we demonstrate that the hot-electron injection from a plasmonic resonator breaks the centrosymmtry of an adjacent transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer, probed via second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a Au-nanoparticle@bilayer-MoS$_2$@Au-film hybrid system. Power-dependent SHG measurements exhibit saturation behavior, consistent with a capacitor model where interfacial charge accumulation creates a dynamic barrier limiting further electron injection. Polarization-resolved SHG measurements reveal anisotropic second-order susceptibility response under hot-electron injection, where the contrast between different susceptibility components provides a quantitative measure of symmetry-breaking anisotropy. First-principles calculations elucidate the nonlinear optical responses evolution in bilayer MoS$_2$ and comfirm the anisotropic modification of susceptibility components under hot-electron injection, modeled by a perpendicular electric field. Our work establishes SHG as an effective probe of hot-electron-induced symmetry breaking in 2D materials, demonstrating a promising approach for ultrafast manipulation of material properties through controlled charge injection at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum: setting the record straight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) associated with spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses has been the subject of recent debate. We demonstrate that the approaches to tOAM presented in several recent papers are incorrect and lead to unphysical results, including erroneous claims of zero total tOAM. We emphasize the importance of calculating the OAM of any extended physical object at a common instant of time, and reemphasize the special status of the centre of energy as a reference point for all OAM calculations. The theory presented in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] is the only correct classical field-based framework that both agrees with experiments and provides a self consistent understanding of transverse OAM in spatiotemporal light fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) enables label-free functional imaging by capturing temporal OCT signal variations caused by intracellular and intratissue motions. However, the relationship between DOCT signals and the sample motion behind them remains unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive DOCT simulation framework that incorporates mathematical models of intracellular/intratissue motions, two OCT signal generator types that generate OCT signal time sequences from the moving scatterer models, and representative DOCT algorithms. The theory and algorithms of the framework are described in detail, and the utility of this framework is demonstrated through numerical studies. This framework is available as open source and will enhance the understanding and utility of DOCT.</description>
