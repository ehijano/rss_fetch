      <title>Deep Generative Models for Synthetic Financial Data: Applications to Portfolio and Risk Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21798v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic financial data provides a practical solution to the privacy, accessibility, and reproducibility challenges that often constrain empirical research in quantitative finance. This paper investigates the use of deep generative models, specifically Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate realistic synthetic financial return series for portfolio construction and risk modeling applications. Using historical daily returns from the S and P 500 as a benchmark, we generate synthetic datasets under comparable market conditions and evaluate them using statistical similarity metrics, temporal structure tests, and downstream financial tasks. The study shows that TimeGAN produces synthetic data with distributional shapes, volatility patterns, and autocorrelation behaviour that are close to those observed in real returns. When applied to mean--variance portfolio optimization, the resulting synthetic datasets lead to portfolio weights, Sharpe ratios, and risk levels that remain close to those obtained from real data. The VAE provides more stable training but tends to smooth extreme market movements, which affects risk estimation. Finally, the analysis supports the use of synthetic datasets as substitutes for real financial data in portfolio analysis and risk simulation, particularly when models are able to capture temporal dynamics. Synthetic data therefore provides a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and reproducible tool for financial experimentation and model development.</description>

      <title>Investigating Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines in Regime Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) for modeling high-dimensional financial time series and detecting systemic risk regimes. We extend the classical application of static Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) by incorporating autoregressive conditioning and utilizing Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) to incorporate complex temporal dependency structures. Comparing a discrete Bernoulli-Bernoulli architecture against a continuous Gaussian-Bernoulli variant across a multi-asset dataset spanning 2013-2025, we observe a dichotomy between generative fidelity and regime detection. While the Gaussian CRBM successfully preserves static asset correlations, it exhibits limitations in generating long-range volatility clustering. Thus, we analyze the free energy as a relative negative log-likelihood (surprisal) under a fixed, trained model. We demonstrate that the model's free energy serves as a robust, regime stability metric. By decomposing the free energy into quadratic (magnitude) and structural (correlation) components, we show that the model can distinguish between pure magnitude shocks and market regimes. Our findings suggest that the CRBM offers a valuable, interpretable diagnostic tool for monitoring systemic risk, providing a supplemental metric to implied volatility metrics like the VIX.</description>
