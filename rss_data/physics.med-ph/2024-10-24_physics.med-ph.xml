      <title>Facile One Pot Synthesis of Hybrid Core-Shell Silica-Based Sensors for Live Imaging of Dissolved Oxygen and Hypoxia Mapping in 3D cell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence imaging allows for non-invasively visualizing and measuring key physiological parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen. In our work, we created two ratiometric fluorescent microsensors designed for accurately tracking dissolved oxygen levels in 3D cell cultures. We developed a simple and cost-effective method to produce hybrid core-shell silica microparticles that are biocompatible and versatile. These sensors incorporate oxygen-sensitive probes (Ru(dpp) or PtOEP) and reference dyes (RBITC or A647 NHS-Ester). SEM analysis confirmed efficient loading and distribution of the sensing dye on the outer shell. Fluorimetric and CLSM tests demonstrated the sensors' reversibility and high sensitivity to oxygen, even when integrated into 3D scaffolds. Aging and bleaching experiments validated the stability of our hybrid core-shell silica microsensors for 3D monitoring. The Ru(dpp)-RBITC microparticles showed the most promising performance, especially in a pancreatic cancer model using alginate microgels. By employing computational segmentation, we generated 3D oxygen maps during live cell imaging, revealing oxygen gradients in the extracellular matrix and indicating a significant decrease in oxygen levels characteristic of solid tumors. Notably, after 12 hours, the oxygen concentration dropped to a hypoxic level of PO2 2.7 +/- 0.1%.</description>

      <title>BlurryScope: a cost-effective and compact scanning microscope for automated HER2 scoring using deep learning on blurry image data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. BlurryScope integrates specialized hardware with a neural network-based model to quickly process motion-blurred histological images and perform automated pathology classification. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight, making it ideal for fast triaging in small clinics, as well as for resource-limited settings. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept of BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. We evaluated this approach by scanning HER2-stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) at a continuous speed of 5 mm/s, which introduces bidirectional motion blur artifacts. These compromised images were then used to train our network models. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved blind testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+ , 2+/3+) HER2 score classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping of regions of interest, as well as HER2 score classification. We believe BlurryScope has the potential to enhance the current pathology infrastructure in resource-scarce environments, save diagnostician time and bolster cancer identification and classification across various clinical environments.</description>
