      <title>Wireless Earphone-based Real-Time Monitoring of Breathing Exercises: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several therapy routines require deep breathing exercises as a key component and patients undergoing such therapies must perform these exercises regularly. Assessing the outcome of a therapy and tailoring its course necessitates monitoring a patient's compliance with the therapy. While therapy compliance monitoring is routine in a clinical environment, it is challenging to do in an at-home setting. This is so because a home setting lacks access to specialized equipment and skilled professionals needed to effectively monitor the performance of a therapy routine by a patient. For some types of therapies, these challenges can be addressed with the use of consumer-grade hardware, such as earphones and smartphones, as practical solutions. To accurately monitor breathing exercises using wireless earphones, this paper proposes a framework that has the potential for assessing a patient's compliance with an at-home therapy. The proposed system performs real-time detection of breathing phases and channels with high accuracy by processing a $\mathbf{500}$ ms audio signal through two convolutional neural networks. The first network, called a channel classifier, distinguishes between nasal and oral breathing, and a pause. The second network, called a phase classifier, determines whether the audio segment is from inhalation or exhalation. According to $k$-fold cross-validation, the channel and phase classifiers achieved a maximum F1 score of $\mathbf{97.99\%}$ and $\mathbf{89.46\%}$, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of using commodity earphones for real-time breathing channel and phase detection for breathing therapy compliance monitoring.</description>

      <title>MAD Speech: Measures of Acoustic Diversity of Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative spoken language models produce speech in a wide range of voices, prosody, and recording conditions, seemingly approaching the diversity of natural speech. However, the extent to which generated speech is acoustically diverse remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate metrics. We address this gap by developing lightweight metrics of acoustic diversity, which we collectively refer to as MAD Speech. We focus on measuring five facets of acoustic diversity: voice, gender, emotion, accent, and background noise. We construct the metrics as a composition of specialized, per-facet embedding models and an aggregation function that measures diversity within the embedding space. Next, we build a series of datasets with a priori known diversity preferences for each facet. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve a stronger agreement with the ground-truth diversity than baselines. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our proposed metrics across several real-life evaluation scenarios. MAD Speech will be made publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>PRODIS - a speech database and a phoneme-based language model for the study of predictability effects in Polish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a speech database and a phoneme-level language model of Polish. The database and model are designed for the analysis of prosodic and discourse factors and their impact on acoustic parameters in interaction with predictability effects. The database is also the first large, publicly available Polish speech corpus of excellent acoustic quality that can be used for phonetic analysis and training of multi-speaker speech technology systems. The speech in the database is processed in a pipeline that achieves a 90% degree of automation. It incorporates state-of-the-art, freely available tools enabling database expansion or adaptation to additional languages.</description>

      <title>Deferred NAM: Low-latency Top-K Context Injection via DeferredContext Encoding for Non-Streaming ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual biasing enables speech recognizers to transcribe important phrases in the speaker's context, such as contact names, even if they are rare in, or absent from, the training data. Attention-based biasing is a leading approach which allows for full end-to-end cotraining of the recognizer and biasing system and requires no separate inference-time components. Such biasers typically consist of a context encoder; followed by a context filter which narrows down the context to apply, improving per-step inference time; and, finally, context application via cross attention. Though much work has gone into optimizing per-frame performance, the context encoder is at least as important: recognition cannot begin before context encoding ends. Here, we show the lightweight phrase selection pass can be moved before context encoding, resulting in a speedup of up to 16.1 times and enabling biasing to scale to 20K phrases with a maximum pre-decoding delay under 33ms. With the addition of phrase- and wordpiece-level cross-entropy losses, our technique also achieves up to a 37.5% relative WER reduction over the baseline without the losses and lightweight phrase selection pass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, growing health awareness, novel methods allow individuals to monitor sleep at home. Utilizing sleep sounds offers advantages over conventional methods like smartwatches, being non-intrusive, and capable of detecting various physiological activities. This study aims to construct a machine learning-based sleep assessment model providing evidence-based assessments, such as poor sleep due to frequent movement during sleep onset. Extracting sleep sound events, deriving latent representations using VAE, clustering with GMM, and training LSTM for subjective sleep assessment achieved a high accuracy of 94.8% in distinguishing sleep satisfaction. Moreover, TimeSHAP revealed differences in impactful sound event types and timings for different individuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-based generative models for music have seen great strides recently, but so far have not managed to produce full-length music tracks with coherent musical structure. We show that by training a generative model on long temporal contexts it is possible to produce long-form music of up to 4m45s. Our model consists of a diffusion-transformer operating on a highly downsampled continuous latent representation (latent rate of 21.5Hz). It obtains state-of-the-art generations according to metrics on audio quality and prompt alignment, and subjective tests reveal that it produces full-length music with coherent structure.</description>

      <title>Multiple Mobile Target Detection and Tracking in Active Sonar Array Using a Track-Before-Detect Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for detecting and tracking underwater mobile objects using active acoustic transmission of broadband chirp signals whose reflections are received by a hydrophone array. The method overcomes the problem of high false alarm rate by applying a track-before-detect ap- proach to the sequence of received reflections. A 2D time- space matrix is created for the reverberations received from each transmitted probe signal by performing delay and sum beamforming and pulse compression. The result is filtered by a 2D constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector to identify reflection patterns corresponding to potential targets. Closely spaced signals for multiple probe transmissions are combined into blobs to avoid multiple detections of a single object. A track- before-detect method using a Nearly Constant Velocity (NCV) model is employed to track multiple objects. The position and velocity is estimated by the debiased converted measurement Kalman filter. Results are analyzed for simulated scenarios and for experiments at sea, where GPS tagged gilt-head seabream fish were tracked. Compared to two benchmark schemes, the results show a favorable track continuity and accuracy that is robust to the choice of detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Language Proficiency and F0 Entrainment: A Study of L2 English Imitation in Italian, French, and Slovak Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores F0 entrainment in second language (L2) English speech imitation during an Alternating Reading Task (ART). Participants with Italian, French, and Slovak native languages imitated English utterances, and their F0 entrainment was quantified using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between the parameterized F0 contours of the imitated utterances and those of the model utterances. Results indicate a nuanced relationship between L2 English proficiency and entrainment: speakers with higher proficiency generally exhibit less entrainment in pitch variation and declination. However, within dyads, the more proficient speakers demonstrate a greater ability to mimic pitch range, leading to increased entrainment. This suggests that proficiency influences entrainment differently at individual and dyadic levels, highlighting the complex interplay between language skill and prosodic adaptation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of human-in-the-loop control for generating prosody in the context of text-to-speech synthesis. Controlling prosody is challenging because existing generative models lack an efficient interface through which users can modify the output quickly and precisely. To solve this, we introduce a novel framework whereby the user provides partial inputs and the generative model generates the missing features. We propose a model that is specifically designed to encode partial prosodic features and output complete audio. We show empirically that our model displays two essential qualities of a human-in-the-loop control mechanism: efficiency and robustness. With even a very small number of input values (~4), our model enables users to improve the quality of the output significantly in terms of listener preference (4:1).</description>

      <title>Pre-training Music Classification Models via Music Source Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study whether music source separation can be used as a pre-training strategy for music representation learning, targeted at music classification tasks. To this end, we first pre-train U-Net networks under various music source separation objectives, such as the isolation of vocal or instrumental sources from a musical piece; afterwards, we attach a convolutional tail network to the pre-trained U-Net and jointly finetune the whole network. The features learned by the separation network are also propagated to the tail network through skip connections. Experimental results in two widely used and publicly available datasets indicate that pre-training the U-Nets with a music source separation objective can improve performance compared to both training the whole network from scratch and using the tail network as a standalone in two music classification tasks: music auto-tagging, when vocal separation is used, and music genre classification for the case of multi-source separation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Speech Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn language from raw audio, without textual resources. Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser speech tokenization.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Song: Towards Controllable Music Generation Incorporating Vocals and Accompaniment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A song is a combination of singing voice and accompaniment. However, existing works focus on singing voice synthesis and music generation independently. Little attention was paid to explore song synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel task called text-to-song synthesis which incorporating both vocals and accompaniments generation. We develop Melodist, a two-stage text-to-song method that consists of singing voice synthesis (SVS) and vocal-to-accompaniment (V2A) synthesis. Melodist leverages tri-tower contrastive pretraining to learn more effective text representation for controllable V2A synthesis. A Chinese song dataset mined from a music website is built up to alleviate data scarcity for our research. The evaluation results on our dataset demonstrate that Melodist can synthesize songs with comparable quality and style consistency. Audio samples can be found in https://text2songMelodist.github.io/Sample/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes AssemblyAI's industrial-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, designed to meet the requirements of large-scale, multilingual ASR serving various application needs. Our system leverages a diverse training dataset comprising unsupervised (12.5M hours), supervised (188k hours), and pseudo-labeled (1.6M hours) data across four languages. We provide a detailed description of our model architecture, consisting of a full-context 600M-parameter Conformer encoder pre-trained with BEST-RQ and an RNN-T decoder fine-tuned jointly with the encoder. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive word error rates (WERs) against larger and more computationally expensive models, such as Whisper large and Canary-1B. Furthermore, our architectural choices yield several key advantages, including an improved code-switching capability, a 5x inference speedup compared to an optimized Whisper baseline, a 30% reduction in hallucination rate on speech data, and a 90% reduction in ambient noise compared to Whisper, along with significantly improved time-stamp accuracy. Throughout this work, we adopt a system-centric approach to analyzing various aspects of fully-fledged ASR models to gain practically relevant insights useful for real-world services operating at scale.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in Convnets for Raw Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What makes waveform-based deep learning so hard? Despite numerous attempts at training convolutional neural networks (convnets) for filterbank design, they often fail to outperform hand-crafted baselines. These baselines are linear time-invariant systems: as such, they can be approximated by convnets with wide receptive fields. Yet, in practice, gradient-based optimization leads to suboptimal approximations. In our article, we approach this phenomenon from the perspective of initialization. We present a theory of large deviations for the energy response of FIR filterbanks with random Gaussian weights. We find that deviations worsen for large filters and locally periodic input signals, which are both typical for audio signal processing applications. Numerical simulations align with our theory and suggest that the condition number of a convolutional layer follows a logarithmic scaling law between the number and length of the filters, which is reminiscent of discrete wavelet bases.</description>

      <title>Dual-Branch Knowledge Distillation for Noise-Robust Synthetic Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most research in synthetic speech detection (SSD) focuses on improving performance on standard noise-free datasets. However, in actual situations, noise interference is usually present, causing significant performance degradation in SSD systems. To improve noise robustness, this paper proposes a dual-branch knowledge distillation synthetic speech detection (DKDSSD) method. Specifically, a parallel data flow of the clean teacher branch and the noisy student branch is designed, and interactive fusion module and response-based teacher-student paradigms are proposed to guide the training of noisy data from both the data distribution and decision-making perspectives. In the noisy student branch, speech enhancement is introduced initially for denoising, aiming to reduce the interference of strong noise. The proposed interactive fusion combines denoised features and noisy features to mitigate the impact of speech distortion and ensure consistency with the data distribution of the clean branch. The teacher-student paradigm maps the student's decision space to the teacher's decision space, enabling noisy speech to behave similarly to clean speech. Additionally, a joint training method is employed to optimize both branches for achieving global optimality. Experimental results based on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs effectively in noisy environments and maintains its performance in cross-dataset experiments.

      <title>EchoScan: Scanning Complex Indoor Geometries via Acoustic Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of indoor space geometries is vital for constructing precise digital twins, whose broad industrial applications include navigation in unfamiliar environments and efficient evacuation planning, particularly in low-light conditions. This study introduces EchoScan, a deep neural network model that utilizes acoustic echoes to perform room geometry inference. Conventional sound-based techniques rely on estimating geometry-related room parameters such as wall position and room size, thereby limiting the diversity of inferable room geometries. Contrarily, EchoScan overcomes this limitation by directly inferring room floorplans and heights, thereby enabling it to handle rooms with arbitrary shapes, including curved walls. The key innovation of EchoScan is its ability to analyze the complex relationship between low- and high-order reflections in room impulse responses (RIRs) using a multi-aggregation module. The analysis of high-order reflections also enables it to infer complex room shapes when echoes are unobservable from the position of an audio device. Herein, EchoScan was trained and evaluated using RIRs synthesized from complex environments, including the Manhattan and Atlanta layouts, employing a practical audio device configuration compatible with commercial, off-the-shelf devices. Compared with vision-based methods, EchoScan demonstrated outstanding geometry estimation performance in rooms with various shapes.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Network for Acoustic Resonance Analysis in a One-Dimensional Acoustic Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study devised a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to solve the wave equation for acoustic resonance analysis. The proposed analytical model, ResoNet, minimizes the loss function for periodic solutions and conventional PINN loss functions, thereby effectively using the function approximation capability of neural networks while performing resonance analysis. Additionally, it can be easily applied to inverse problems. The resonance in a one-dimensional acoustic tube, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through the forward and inverse analyses of the wave equation with energy-loss terms. In the forward analysis, the applicability of PINN to the resonance problem was evaluated via comparison with the finite-difference method. The inverse analysis, which included identifying the energy loss term in the wave equation and design optimization of the acoustic tube, was performed with good accuracy.</description>

      <title>MLAAD: The Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoofing Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09512</link>

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology brings significant advantages, such as giving a voice to those with speech impairments, but also enables audio deepfakes and spoofs. The former mislead individuals and may propagate misinformation, while the latter undermine voice biometric security systems. AI-based detection can help to address these challenges by automatically differentiating between genuine and fabricated voice recordings. However, these models are only as good as their training data, which currently is severely limited due to an overwhelming concentration on English and Chinese audio in anti-spoofing databases, thus restricting its worldwide effectiveness. In response, this paper presents the Multi-Language Audio Anti-Spoof Dataset (MLAAD), created using 54 TTS models, comprising 21 different architectures, to generate 163.9 hours of synthetic voice in 23 different languages. We train and evaluate three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models with MLAAD, and observe that MLAAD demonstrates superior performance over comparable datasets like InTheWild or FakeOrReal when used as a training resource. Furthermore, in comparison with the renowned ASVspoof 2019 dataset, MLAAD proves to be a complementary resource. In tests across eight datasets, MLAAD and ASVspoof 2019 alternately outperformed each other, both excelling on four datasets. By publishing MLAAD and making trained models accessible via an interactive webserver , we aim to democratize antispoofing technology, making it accessible beyond the realm of specialists, thus contributing to global efforts against audio spoofing and deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) Challenge 2024 Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09342</link>

Abstract: The advancements of technology have led to the use of multimodal systems in various real-world applications. Among them, the audio-visual systems are one of the widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and voice of a person has gained attention due to presence of unique correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) Challenge 2024 focuses on exploring face-voice association under a unique condition of multilingual scenario. This condition is inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and most often people communicate under multilingual scenario. The challenge uses a dataset namely, Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice association in multilingual environments. This report provides the details of the challenge, dataset, baselines and task details for the FAME Challenge.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>
