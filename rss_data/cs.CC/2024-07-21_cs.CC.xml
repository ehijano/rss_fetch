      <title>QBF Merge Resolution is powerful but unnatural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.
  Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) M-Res is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that M-Res is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</description>

      <title>On a class of interdiction problems with partition matroids: complexity and polynomial-time algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems, where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower) are induced by two distinct partition matroids with a common weighted ground set. Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a 2-flip local search algorithm for the leader.</description>

      <title>Small unsatisfiable $k$-CNFs with bounded literal occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the smallest unsatisfiable formulas in subclasses of $k$-CNF (exactly $k$ distinct literals per clause) with bounded variable or literal occurrences. Smaller unsatisfiable formulas of this type translate into stronger inapproximability results for MaxSAT in the considered formula class. Our results cover subclasses of 3-CNF and 4-CNF; in all subclasses of 3-CNF we considered we were able to determine the smallest size of an unsatisfiable formula; in the case of 4-CNF with at most 5 occurrences per variable we decreased the size of the smallest known unsatisfiable formula. Our methods combine theoretical arguments and symmetry-breaking exhaustive search based on SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS), a recent framework for isomorph-free SAT-based graph generation. To this end, and as a standalone result of independent interest, we show how to encode formulas as graphs efficiently for SMS.</description>
