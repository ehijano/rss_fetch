      <title>Image resizing by neural network operators and their convergence rate with respect to the $L^p$-norm and the dissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In literature, several algorithms for imaging based on interpolation or approximation methods are available. The implementation of theoretical processes highlighted the necessity of providing theoretical frameworks for the convergence and error estimate analysis to support the experimental setups. In this paper, we establish new techniques for deriving quantitative estimates for the order of approximation for multivariate linear operators of the pointwise-type, with respect to the $L^p$-norm and to the so-called dissimilarity index defined through the continuous SSIM. In particular, we consider a family of approximation operators known as neural network (NN) operators, that have been widely studied in the last years in view of their connection with the theory of artificial neural networks. For these operators, we first establish sharp estimates in case of $C^1$ and piecewise (everywhere defined) $C^1$-functions. Then, the case of functions modeling digital images is considered, and specific quantitative estimates are achieved, including those with respect to the mentioned dissimilarity index. Moreover, the above analysis has also been extended to $L^p$-spaces, using a new constructive technique, in which the multivariate averaged modulus of smoothness has been employed. Finally, numerical experiments of image resizing have been given to support the theoretical results. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through similarity indexes such as SSIM, likelihood index (S-index) and PSNR, and compared with other rescaling methods, including bilinear, bicubic, and upscaling-de la Vall\'ee-Poussin interpolation (u-VPI). Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method for image processing tasks, particularly in terms of the aforementioned SSIM, and are consistent with the provided theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Blocking structures, approximation, and preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider block-structured matrices $A_n$, where the blocks are of (block) unilevel Toeplitz type with $s\times t$ matrix-valued generating functions. Under mild assumptions on the size of the (rectangular) blocks, the asymptotic distribution of the singular values of {the} associated matrix-sequences is identified and, when the related singular value symbol is Hermitian, it coincides with the spectral symbol. Building on the theoretical derivations, we approximate the matrices with simplified block structures that show two important features: a) the related simplified matrix-sequence has the same distributions as $\{A_{{n}}\}_{{n}}$; b) a generic linear system involving the simplified structures can be solved in $O(n\log n)$ arithmetic operations. The two key properties a) and b) suggest a natural way for preconditioning a linear system with coefficient matrix $A_n$. Under mild assumptions, the singular value analysis and the spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix-sequences is provided, together with a wide set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation in 2D nonlinear coupled sound and heat flow, using a stabilized explicit finite difference scheme marched backward in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the ill-posed data assimilation problem associated with hyperbolic/parabolic systems describing 2D coupled sound and heat flow. Given hypothetical data at time T &gt; 0, that may not correspond to an actual solution of the dissipative system at time T, initial data at time t = 0 are sought that can evolve, through the dissipative system, into a useful approximation to the desired data at time T. That may not always be possible. A stabilized explicit finite difference scheme, marching backward in time, is developed and applied to nonlinear examples in non rectangular regions. Stabilization is achieved by applying a compensating smoothing operator at each time step, to quench the instability. Analysis of convergence is restricted to the transparent case of linear, autonomous, selfadjoint spatial differential operators. However, the actual computational scheme can be applied to more general problems. Data assimilation is illustrated using 512x512 pixel images. Such images are associated with highly irregular non smooth intensity data that severely challenge ill-posed reconstruction procedures. Successful and unsuccessful examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Real-Time Bayesian Inference for Linear Autonomous Dynamical Systems With Application to Digital Twins for Tsunami Early Warning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a goal-oriented framework for constructing digital twins with the following properties: (1) they employ discretizations of high-fidelity PDE models governed by autonomous dynamical systems, leading to large-scale forward problems; (2) they solve a linear inverse problem to assimilate observational data to infer uncertain model components followed by a forward prediction of the evolving dynamics; and (3) the entire end-to-end, data-to-inference-to-prediction computation is carried out in real time through a Bayesian framework that rigorously accounts for uncertainties. Realizations of such a framework are faced with several challenges that stem from the extreme scale of forward models and, in some cases, slow eigenvalue decay of the parameter-to-observable map. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to overcome these challenges by exploiting the autonomous structure of the forward model. As a result, we can move the PDE solutions, which dominate the cost for solving the Bayesian inverse problem, to an offline computation and leverage the high-performance dense linear algebra capabilities of GPUs to accelerate the online prediction of quantities of interest. We seek to apply this framework to construct digital twins for the Cascadia subduction zone as a means of providing early warning for tsunamis generated by subduction zone megathrust earthquakes. To that end, we demonstrate how our methodology can be used to employ seafloor pressure observations, along with the coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer the earthquake-induced seafloor motion (discretized with $O(10^9)$ parameters) and forward predict the tsunami propagation. We present results of an end-to-end inference, prediction, and uncertainty quantification for a representative test problem for which this goal-oriented Bayesian inference is accomplished in real time, that is, in a matter of seconds.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for computing stationary states of spherical Landau-Brazovskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a set of efficient methods to compute stationary states of the spherical Landau-Brazovskii (LB) model in a discretization-then-optimization way. First, we discretize the spherical LB energy functional into a finite-dimensional energy function by the spherical harmonic expansion. Then five optimization methods are developed to compute stationary states of the discretized energy function, including the accelerated adaptive Bregman proximal gradient, Nesterov, adaptive Nesterov, adaptive nonlinear conjugate gradient and adaptive gradient descent methods. To speed up the convergence, we propose a principal mode analysis (PMA) method to estimate good initial configurations and sphere radius. The PMA method also reveals the relationship between the optimal sphere radius and the dominant degree of spherical harmonics. Numerical experiments show that our approaches significantly reduce the number of iterations and the computational time</description>

      <title>Discovering Dynamics with Kolmogorov Arnold Networks: Linear Multistep Method-Based Algorithms and Error Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the underlying dynamics from observed data is a critical task in various scientific fields. Recent advances have shown that combining deep learning techniques with linear multistep methods (LMMs) can be highly effective for this purpose. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) with LMMs for the discovery and approximation of dynamical systems' vector fields. Specifically, we begin by establishing precise error bounds for two-layer B-spline KANs when approximating the governing functions of dynamical systems. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of KANs, we demonstrate that for certain families of LMMs, the total error is constrained within a specific range that accounts for both the method's step size and the network's approximation accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the difference between the numerical solution obtained from solving the ordinary differential equations with the fitted vector fields and the true solution of the dynamical system. To validate our theoretical results, we provide several numerical examples that highlight the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time error estimate of random batch method with replacement for the Cucker-Smale model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Random Batch Method (RBM), proposed by Jin et al. in 2020, is an efficient algorithm for simulating interacting particle systems. The uniform-in-time error estimates of the RBM without replacement have been obtained for various interacting particle systems, while the analysis of the RBM with replacement is just considered in (Cai et al., 2024) recently for the first-order systems governed by Langevin dynamics. In this work, we present the error estimate for the RBM with replacement applied to a second-order system known as the Cucker-Smale model. By introducing a crucial auxiliary system and leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of the Cucker-Smale model, we derive an estimate that is uniform in both time and particle numbers. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations to validate the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Stabilization-Free H(curl) and H(div)-Conforming Virtual Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stabilization-free virtual element method for genreal order $\mathbf{H}(\operatorname{\mathbf{curl}})$ and $\mathbf{H}(\operatorname{div})$-conforming spaces. By the exact sequence of node, edge and face virtual element spaces, this method is applicable to PDEs involving $\nabla, \nabla\times$ and $\nabla\cdot$ operators. The key is to construct the noval serendipity virtual element spaces under the equivalence of the $L^2$-serendipity projector, from a sufficiently high order original space so that a stable polynomial projection is computable. The optimal approximation properties of the noval serendipity spaces are also proved.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Deep Ritz Method for Monotone Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel iterative deep Ritz method (IDRM) for solving a general class of elliptic problems. It is inspired by the iterative procedure for minimizing the loss during the training of the neural network, but at each step encodes the geometry of the underlying function space and incorporates a convex penalty to enhance the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to elliptic problems involving a monotone operator (not necessarily of variational form) and does not impose any stringent regularity assumption on the solution. It improves several existing neural PDE solvers, e.g., physics informed neural network and deep Ritz method, in terms of the accuracy for the concerned class of elliptic problems. Further, we establish a convergence rate for the method using tools from geometry of Banach spaces and theory of monotone operators, and also analyze the learning error. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method, we present several challenging examples, including a comparative study with existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Robust Preconditioners for A Four-Field Thermo-Poroelasticity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a thermo-poroelasticity model which describes the interaction between the deformation of an elastic porous material and fluid flow under non-isothermal conditions. The model involves several parameters that can vary significantly in practical applications, posing a challenge for developing discretization techniques and solution algorithms that handle such variations effectively. We propose a four-field formulation and apply a conforming finite element discretization. The primary focus is on constructing and analyzing preconditioners for the resulting linear system. Two preconditioners are proposed: one involves regrouping variables and treating the 4-by-4 system as a 2-by-2 block form, while the other is directly constructed from the 4-by-4 coupled operator. Both preconditioners are demonstrated to be robust with respect to variations in parameters and mesh refinement. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners and validate their theoretical performance under varying parameter settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $L_2$-approximation of functions in a weighted Korobov space. We consider a median algorithm, which is related to median integration rules, that have recently gained a lot of interest in the theory of quasi-Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we will use so-called lattice rules as the underlying integration rules. As we will show in the present paper, we can obtain a convergence rate that is arbitrarily close to optimal in terms of the number of evaluations needed of the function to be approximated.</description>

      <title>Convexification With Viscosity Term for an Inverse Problem of Tikhonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965 A.N. Tikhonov, the founder of the theory of Ill-Posed and Inverse Problems, has posed an coefficient inverse problem of the recovery of the unknown electric conductivity coefficient from measurements of the back reflected electrical signal. In the geophysical application targeted by Tikhonov, this coefficient depends only on the depth and characterizes the electrical conductivity of the ground. The goal of this paper is to construct for this problem a version of the globally convergent convexification numerical method for this problem. In this version, the viscosity term is introduced. A Carleman estimate allows to prove global convergence of this method.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the time-discretization of the fluid structure interaction model in the three-dimensional boundary domain is taken into account, which explains the mechanical interaction between the blood flow and the Hookean elasticity. The interface between the two phases is given by a soft transition layer and spreads to the finite thickness. On the implicit Euler scheme for this discretization, We derive a variety of priori estimates and then use the Faedo-Galerkin method to prove the local well-poseedness results.</description>

      <title>A monotonicity-based globalization of the level-set method for inclusion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on a geometrical inverse problem that involves recovering discontinuities in electrical conductivity based on boundary measurements. This problem serves as a model to introduce a shape recovery technique that merges the monotonicity method with the level-set method. The level-set method, commonly used in shape optimization, often relies heavily on the accuracy of the initial guess. To overcome this challenge, we utilize the monotonicity method to generate a more precise initial guess, which is then used to initialize the level-set method. We provide numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of this combined approach.</description>

Abstract: Random coupled parabolic partial differential models are solved numerically using random cosine Fourier transform together with non Gaussian random numerical integration that capture the highly oscillatory behavior of the involved integrands. Sufficient condition of spectral type imposed on the random matrices of the system are given so that the approximated stochastic process solution and its statistical moments are numerically convergent.

      <description>arXiv:2501.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-order nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart discretizations for the nonlinear generalized Stokes equations with $(r,\epsilon)$-structure. Thereby the velocity-errors are independent of the pressure-error; i.e., the method is pressure robust. This improves suboptimal rates previously experienced for non pressure robust methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity and multi-level Monte Carlo methods for kinetic models of traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traffic flow modeling, incorporating uncertainty is crucial for accurately capturing the complexities of real-world scenarios. In this work we focus on kinetic models of traffic flow, where a key step is to design effective numerical tools for analyzing uncertainties in vehicles interactions. To this end we discuss space-homogeneous Boltzmann-type equations, employing a non intrusive Monte Carlo approach both on the physical space, to solve the kinetic equation, and on the stochastic space, to investigate the uncertainty. To address the high dimensional challenges posed by this coupling, control variate approaches such as multi-fidelity and multi-level Monte Carlo methods are particularly effective. While both methods leverage models of varying accuracy to reduce computational demands, multi-fidelity methods exploit differences in model fidelity, while multi-level methods utilize a hierarchy of discretizations. Numerical simulations indicate that these approaches provide substantial accuracy improvements over standard Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, by using appropriate low-fidelity surrogates based on approximated steady state solutions or simplified BGK interactions, multi-fidelity methods can outperform multilevel Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioners with piecewise-polynomial coarse spaces for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse two-level hybrid Schwarz domain-decomposition GMRES preconditioners for finite-element discretisations of the Helmholtz equation with wavenumber $k$, where the coarse space consists of piecewise polynomials.
  We prove results for fixed polynomial degree (in both the fine and coarse spaces), as well as polynomial degree increasing like $\log k$. In the latter case, we prove that, with a fine space of dimension $C_1 k^d (\log k)^{3d}$, a coarse space of dimension $C_2 k^d (\log k)^{d}$ (where $C_2/C_1$ can be arbitrarily small) and subdomains of diameter $\sim k^{-1}(\log k)^{-1}$ with generous overlap, preconditioned GMRES converges in a number of iterations that grows at most like $(\log k)^2$.
  That is, modulo the factors of $\log k$ and the important question of how to efficiently solve the coarse problem, this is the (arguably) theoretically-ideal situation where the fine and coarse spaces are both pollution free, the number of degrees of freedom per subdomain is constant, and the number of iterations is constant.
  Along with the results in the companion paper [Galkowski, Spence, arXiv:2501.11060] (which cover only fixed polynomial degree), these are the first rigorous convergence results about a two-level Schwarz preconditioner applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz equation with a coarse space that does not consist of problem-adapted basis functions.</description>

      <title>MultiPDENet: PDE-embedded Learning with Multi-time-stepping for Accelerated Flow Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by numerical methods meet computational cost challenge for getting the accurate solution since fine grids and small time steps are required. Machine learning can accelerate this process, but struggle with weak generalizability, interpretability, and data dependency, as well as suffer in long-term prediction. To this end, we propose a PDE-embedded network with multiscale time stepping (MultiPDENet), which fuses the scheme of numerical methods and machine learning, for accelerated simulation of flows. In particular, we design a convolutional filter based on the structure of finite difference stencils with a small number of parameters to optimize, which estimates the equivalent form of spatial derivative on a coarse grid to minimize the equation's residual. A Physics Block with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator at the fine time scale is established that embeds the structure of PDEs to guide the prediction. To alleviate the curse of temporal error accumulation in long-term prediction, we introduce a multiscale time integration approach, where a neural network is used to correct the prediction error at a coarse time scale. Experiments across various PDE systems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate that MultiPDENet can accurately predict long-term spatiotemporal dynamics, even given small and incomplete training data, e.g., spatiotemporally down-sampled datasets. MultiPDENet achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other neural baseline models, also with clear speedup compared to classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for Fourier Extension Based on Weighted Generalized Inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the Fourier extension from a new perspective of solving the compact operator equation with perturbed data. By converting the approximation target from the best approximate solution to the weighted best approximate solution, the oscillation in the extended region has been overcome. The error estimation of the solution is theoretically established. Furthermore, we point out the difficulties faced by the original weighted operator in calculation due to the limitation of machine precision and propose an effective correction operator. The relevant parameters involved in the method are further tested, and finally the effectiveness of the method is verified through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An Air-Gap Element for the Isogeometric Space-Time-Simulation of Electric Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time methods promise more efficient time-domain simulations, in particular of electrical machines. However, most approaches require the motion to be known in advance so that it can be included in the space-time mesh. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to use the well-known air-gap element for the rotor-stator coupling of an isogeometric machine model. First, we derive the solution in the air-gap region and then employ it to couple the rotor and stator. This coupling is angle dependent and we show how to efficiently update the coupling matrices to a different angle, avoiding expensive quadrature. Finally, the resulting time-dependent problem is solved in a space-time setting. The spatial discretization using isogeometric analysis is particularly suitable for coupling via the air-gap element, as NURBS can exactly represent the geometry of the air-gap. Furthermore, the model including the air-gap element can be seamlessly transferred to the space-time setting. However, the air-gap element is well known in the literature. The originality of this work is the application to isogeometric analysis and space-time.</description>

      <title>The Lax-Friedrichs method in one-dimensional hemodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discretization of reduced one-dimensional hyperbolic models of blood flow using the Lax-Friedrichs method is discussed. Employing the well-established central scheme in this domain significantly simplifies the implementation of specific boundary and coupling conditions in vascular networks accounting e.g. for a periodic heart beat, vascular occlusions, stented vessel segments and bifurcations. In particular, the coupling of system extensions modeling patient specific geometries and therapies can be realized without information on the eigenstructure of the models. For the derivation of the scheme and the coupling conditions a relaxation of the model is considered and its discrete relaxation limit evaluated. Moreover, a second order MUSCL-type extensions of the scheme is introduced. Numerical experiments in uncoupled and coupled cases that verify the consistency and convergence of the approach are presented.</description>

      <title>Uniform Poincar\'{e} inequalities for the discrete de Rham complex of differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove discrete Poincar\'e inequalities that are uniform in the mesh size for the discrete de Rham complex of differential forms developed in [Bonaldi, Di Pietro, Droniou, and Hu, An exterior calculus framework for polytopal methods, J. Eur. Math. Soc., to appear, arXiv preprint 2303.11093]. We unify the underlying ideas behind the Poincar\'e inequalities for all differential operators in the sequence, extending the known inequalities for the gradient, curl, and divergence in three-dimensions to polytopal domains of arbitrary dimension and general topology. A key step in the proof involves deriving specific Poincar\'e inequalities for the cochain complex supported on the polytopal mesh. These inequalities are of independent interest, as they are useful, for instance, in establishing the existence and stability, on domains of generic topology, of solutions of schemes based on Mimetic Finite Differences, Compatible Discrete Operators or Discrete Geometric Approach.</description>

      <title>3D image based stochastic micro-structure modelling of foams for simulating elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image acquisition techniques such as micro-computed tomography are nowadays widely available. Quantitative analysis of the resulting 3D image data enables geometric characterization of the micro-structure of materials. Stochastic geometry models can be fit to the observed micro-structures. By alteration of the model parameters, virtual micro-structures with modified geometry can be generated. Numerical simulation of elastic properties in realizations of these models yields deeper insight on the influence of particular micro-structural features. Ultimately, this allows for an optimization of the micro-structure geometry for particular applications. Here, we present this workflow at the example of open cell foams. Applicability is demonstrated using an aluminum alloy foam sample. The structure observed in a micro-computed tomography image is modeled by the edge system of a random Laguerre tessellation generated by a system of closely packed spheres. Elastic moduli are computed in the binarized micro-CT image of the foam as well as in realizations of the model. They agree well with the results of a compression test on the real material.</description>

      <title>Nodal AMG Coarsening and Interpolation for PDE Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to constructing a practical coarsening algorithm and interpolation operator for the algebraic multigrid (AMG) method, tailored towards systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) with large near-kernels, such as H(curl) and H(div). Our method builds on compatible relaxation (CR) and the ideal interpolation model within the generalized AMG (GAMG) framework but introduces several modifications to define an AMG method for PDE systems. We construct an interpolation operator through a coarsening process that first coarsens a nodal dual problem and then builds the coarse and fine variables using a matching algorithm. Our interpolation follows the ideal formulation; however, we enhance the sparsity of ideal interpolation by decoupling the fine and coarse variables completely. When the coarse variables align with the geometric refinement, our method reproduces re-discretization on unstructured meshes. Together with an automatic smoother construction scheme that identifies the local near kernels, our approach forms a complete two-grid method. Finally, we also show numerical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this interpolation scheme by applying it to targeted problems and the Stokes system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   This course, intended for undergraduates familiar with elementary calculus and linear algebra, introduces the extension of differential calculus to functions on more general vector spaces, such as functions that take as input a matrix and return a matrix inverse or factorization, derivatives of ODE solutions, and even stochastic derivatives of random functions. It emphasizes practical computational applications, such as large-scale optimization and machine learning, where derivatives must be re-imagined in order to be propagated through complicated calculations. The class also discusses efficiency concerns leading to "adjoint" or "reverse-mode" differentiation (a.k.a. "backpropagation"), and gives a gentle introduction to modern automatic differentiation (AD) techniques.</description>

      <title>Iterative Proximal-Minimization for Computing Saddle Points with Fixed Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing saddle points with a prescribed Morse index on potential energy surfaces is crucial for characterizing transition states for nosie-induced rare transition events in physics and chemistry. Many numerical algorithms for this type of saddle points are based on the eigenvector-following idea and can be cast as an iterative minimization formulation (SINUM. Vol. 53, p.1786, 2015), but they may struggle with convergence issues and require good initial guesses. To address this challenge, we discuss the differential game interpretation of this iterative minimization formulation and investigate the relationship between this game's Nash equilibrium and saddle points on the potential energy surface. Our main contribution is that adding a proximal term, which grows faster than quadratic, to the game's cost function can enhance the stability and robustness. This approach produces a robust Iterative Proximal Minimization (IPM) algorithm for saddle point computing. We show that the IPM algorithm surpasses the preceding methods in robustness without compromising the convergence rate or increasing computational expense. The algorithm's efficacy and robustness are showcased through a two-dimensional test problem, and the Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard equation, underscoring its numerical robustness.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Applied to Steady Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning method to predict steady external fluid flows using elliptic input features is introduced. Using data from as few as one high-fidelity simulation, the proposed method produces models generalizable under changes to boundary geometry by using solutions to elliptic boundary value problems over the flow domain as the model input, instead of Cartesian coordinates of the domain. Training data is generated through pointwise evaluation of flow features at points selected through a quad-tree adaptive sampling method to concentrate training points in areas with large field gradients. Models are trained within a training window around the body, while predictions are smoothly extended to freestream conditions using a Partition-of-Unity extension. Predictive capabilities of the machine learning model are demonstrated in steady-state flow of incompressible fluid around a cylinder and a Joukowski airfoil. The predicted flow field is used to warm-start CFD simulations to achieve acceleration in solver convergence.</description>

      <title>Fully-Automated Code Generation for Efficient Computation of Sparse Matrix Permanents on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory hierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely by the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the compiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into thread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a challenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the unpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at runtime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address this, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity pattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread to store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique that fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion kernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce the number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure of Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our second technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and global memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for greater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup compared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these speedups are 24.9x and 4.9x.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and scalable approach to accelerate a direct-forcing IBM for moving boundary simulations. Building upon the SIMPLE approach, we keep the pressure and forces coupled, formulate the pressure-forces corrections system, solve for pressure-forces corrections, then perform a projection-correction step for velocities followed by a correction step for pressure and forces. To solve the pressure-forces system, we apply a block reduction and suggest an efficient preconditioning approach that is based on using the Laplacian as a preconditioner for the resulting Schur complement. The Laplacian, being independent of the coordinates of the immersed body, is factorized only once (using an efficient direct method) and is then reused throughout the simulation. We present a rigorous proof of the spectral equivalence of the Laplacian and the Schur complement, thereby showing that the preconditioner's efficiency is independent of the grid resolution.
  The performance of the method is validated through simulations of the flow around a periodically oscillating sphere in a three-dimensional box. The methodology is then applied to analyze flows generated by arrays of 7 and 14 sub-spheres modeling porous spheres of different porosities. We show good scalability of the algorithm in terms of computational time and memory consumptions. That is, the iteration count for the preconditioned pressure-forces system is nearly constant, regardless of the grid resolution, Reynolds number, and the number of spheres. The developed approach enables accurate moving boundary simulations to be performed on standard workstations, thereby enhancing accessibility of the simulations to the CFD community.</description>

      <title>Randomised Euler-Maruyama method for SDEs with H\"older continuous drift coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the performance of randomised Euler-Maruyama (EM) method for additive time-inhomogeneous SDEs with an irregular drift. In particular, the drift is assumed to be $\alpha$-H\"older continuous in time and bounded $\beta$-H\"older continuous in space with $\alpha,\beta\in (0,1]$. The strong order of convergence of the randomised EM in $L^p$-norm is shown to be $1/2+(\alpha \wedge (\beta/2))-\epsilon$ for an arbitrary $\epsilon\in (0,1/2)$, higher than the one of standard EM, which is $\alpha \wedge (1/2+\beta/2-\epsilon)$. The proofs highly rely on the stochastic sewing lemma, where we also provide an alternative proof when handling time irregularity for a comparison.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of the gradients in deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms -- typically consisting of a class of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method -- are nowadays an integral part in many areas of science, industry, and also our day to day life. Roughly speaking, in their most basic form, ANNs can be regarded as functions that consist of a series of compositions of affine-linear functions with multidimensional versions of so-called activation functions. One of the most popular of such activation functions is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function $\mathbb{R} \ni x \mapsto \max\{ x, 0 \} \in \mathbb{R}$. The ReLU function is, however, not differentiable and, typically, this lack of regularity transfers to the cost function of the supervised learning problem under consideration. Regardless of this lack of differentiability issue, deep learning practioners apply SGD methods based on suitably generalized gradients in standard deep learning libraries like {\sc TensorFlow} or {\sc Pytorch}. In this work we reveal an accurate and concise mathematical description of such generalized gradients in the training of deep fully-connected feedforward ANNs and we also study the resulting generalized gradient function analytically. Specifically, we provide an appropriate approximation procedure that uniquely describes the generalized gradient function, we prove that the generalized gradients are limiting Fr\'echet subgradients of the cost functional, and we conclude that the generalized gradients must coincide with the standard gradient of the cost functional on every open sets on which the cost functional is continuously differentiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thin plates where out-of-plane deformations arise due to membrane kinematic incompatibility of rotational type, specifically Volterra wedge disclinations, which are commonly observed in metal plates and graphene. We present theorems that guarantee the existence and regularity of equilibrium solutions in the presence of a finite number of disclinations and a dead load, for clamped plates. To solve the equilibrium equations, we implement a numerical code in the FEniCS environment and apply it to a series of parametric test studies. Our Finite Element method follows the Discontinuous Galerkin approach with C0 elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to derive the equivalent partial differential equations of a lattice Boltzmann scheme,the Chapman Enskog expansion is very popular in the lattive Boltzmann community. A maindrawback of this approach is the fact that multiscale expansions are used without any clearmathematical signification of the various variables and operators. Independently of thisframework, the Taylor expansion method allows to obtain formally the equivalent partialdifferential equations. In this contribution, we prove that both approaches give identicalresults with acoustic scaling for a very general family of lattice Boltzmann schemes and upto fourth order accuracy. Examples with a single scalar conservation illustrate our purpose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parareal algorithm represents an important class of parallel-in-time algorithms for solving evolution equations and has been widely applied in practice. To achieve effective speedup, the choice of the coarse propagator in the algorithm is vital. In this work, we investigate the use of {optimized} coarse propagators. Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., linear diffusion model, Allen-Cahn model, and viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a stabilized space--time method for the monodomain equation coupled with the Rogers--McCulloch ionic model, which is widely used to simulate electrophysiological wave propagation in the cardiac tissue. By extending the Spline Upwind method and exploiting low-rank matrix approximations, as well as preconditioned solvers, we achieve both significant computational efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we develop a formulation that is both simple and highly effective, designed to minimize spurious oscillations and ensuring computational efficiency. We rigorously validate the method's performance through a series of numerical experiments, showing its robustness and reliability in diverse scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The growth factor in Gaussian elimination measures how large the entries of an LU factorization can be relative to the entries of the original matrix. It is a key parameter in error estimates, and one of the most fundamental topics in numerical analysis. We produce an upper bound of $n^{0.2079 \ln n +0.91}$ for the growth factor in Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting -- the first improvement upon Wilkinson's original 1961 bound of $2 \, n ^{0.25\ln n +0.5}$.</description>

We propose to represent the PDE in the form of a computational graph, facilitating the seamless integration of both symbolic and numerical information inherent in a PDE. A graph Transformer and an implicit neural representation (INR) are employed to generate mesh-free predicted solutions. Following pretraining on data exhibiting a certain level of diversity, our model achieves zero-shot accuracies on benchmark datasets that is comparable to those of specifically trained expert models.

Abstract: In this work, the infinite GMRES algorithm, recently proposed by Correnty et al., is employed in contour integral-based nonlinear eigensolvers, avoiding the computation of costly factorizations at each quadrature node to solve the linear systems efficiently. Several techniques are applied to make the infinite GMRES memory-friendly, computationally efficient, and numerically stable in practice. More specifically, we analyze the relationship between polynomial eigenvalue problems and their scaled linearizations, and provide a novel weighting strategy which can significantly accelerate the convergence of infinite GMRES in this particular context. We also adopt the technique of TOAR to infinite GMRES to reduce the memory footprint. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the SINDy approach with nested neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) framework, which uses sparse regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression, surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Preconditioners for Iterative Solutions of Sparse Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preconditioning is at the heart of iterative solutions of large, sparse linear systems of equations in scientific disciplines. Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.</description>

With the PDE represented as a computational graph, we facilitate the seamless integration of symbolic and numeric information inherent in a PDE. A graph Transformer and an implicit neural representation (INR) are employed subsequently to generate mesh-free predicted solutions. We generated a dataset with up to three million samples involving diverse one-dimensional PDEs to pretrain our model. Compared with baseline models trained specifically on benchmark datasets, our pretrained model achieves comparable accuracy via zero-shot inference, and the advantage expands after finetuning. For PDEs new or unseen in the pretraining stage, our model can adapt quickly by finetuning on a relatively small set of examples from the target equation. Additionally, PDEformer-1 demonstrates promising results in the inverse problem of PDE scalar coefficient recovery and coefficient field recovery.</description>

      <title>Optimal Polynomial Smoothers for Parallel AMG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore polynomial accelerators that are well-suited for parallel computations, specifically as smoothers in Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioners. These accelerators address a minimax problem, initially formulated in [Lottes, Numer. Lin. Alg. with Appl. 30(6), 2518 (2023)], aiming to achieve an optimal (or near-optimal) bound for a polynomial-dependent constant involved in the AMG V-cycle error bound, without requiring information about the matrices' spectra. Lottes focuses on Chebyshev polynomials of the 4th-kind and defines the relevant recurrence formulas applicable to a general convergent basic smoother. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of these accelerations for large-scale applications on modern GPU-accelerated supercomputers. Furthermore, we formulate a variant of the aforementioned minimax problem, which naturally leads to solutions relying on Chebyshev polynomials of the 1st-kind as accelerators for a basic smoother. For all the polynomial accelerations, we describe efficient GPU kernels for their application and demonstrate their comparable effectiveness on standard benchmarks at very large scales.</description>

      <title>Single-Frequency Self-Alignment RF Resonant Beam for Information and Power Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10151v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to power attenuation, improving transmission efficiency in the radio-frequency (RF) band remains a significant challenge, which hinders advancements in various fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless communication. Array design and retro-directive beamforming (RD-BF) techniques offer simple and effective ways to enhance transmission efficiency. However, when the target is an array or in the near field, the RD-BF system (RD-BFS) cannot radiate more energy to the target due to phase irregularities in the target region, resulting in challenges in achieving higher efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the RF-based resonant beam system (RF-RBS), which adaptively optimizes phase and power distribution between transmitting and receiving arrays by leveraging the resonance mechanism to achieve higher transmission efficiency. We analyze the system structure and develop an analytical model to evaluate power flow and resonance establishment. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed RF-RBS achieves self-alignment without beam control and provides higher transmission efficiency compared to RD-BFS, with improvements of up to 16%. This self-alignment capability allows the system to effectively transfer power and information across varying distances and offsets. The numerical results indicate the capability to transmit watt-level power and achieve 21 bps/Hz of downlink spectral efficiency in indoor settings, highlighting the advantages of RF-RBS in information and power transfer for mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Algorithms of very high space-time orders of accuracy for hyperbolic equations in the semidiscrete WENO-DeC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a deep investigation of a family of arbitrary high order numerical methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), with particular emphasis on very high order versions, i.e., with order higher than 5. More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV) semidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and highlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth according to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs with very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time discretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong stability preserving ($\ell SSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect the overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its computational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear advection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing the advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order numerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in real--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as requiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in problems involving discontinuities. Furthermore, the results confirm order degradation and efficiency loss when coupling very high order space discretizations with lower order SSPRK time discretizations.</description>

      <title>A data-driven kinetic model for opinion dynamics with social network contacts</title>

Abstract: Opinion dynamics is an important and very active area of research that delves into the complex processes through which individuals form and modify their opinions within a social context. The ability to comprehend and unravel the mechanisms that drive opinion formation is of great significance for predicting a wide range of social phenomena such as political polarization, the diffusion of misinformation, the formation of public consensus, and the emergence of collective behaviors. In this paper, we aim to contribute to that field by introducing a novel mathematical model that specifically accounts for the influence of social media networks on opinion dynamics. With the rise of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and many others, social networks have become significant arenas where opinions are shared, discussed, and potentially altered. To this aim after an analytical construction of our new model and through incorporation of real-life data from Twitter, we calibrate the model parameters to accurately reflect the dynamics that unfold in social media, showing in particular the role played by the so-called influencers in driving individual opinions towards predetermined directions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Realization of the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A New Cross-Space Total Variation Regularization Model for Color Image Restoration with Quaternion Blur Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear High-Order Mimetic Differences that Satisfy Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

      <title>String Diagram of Optimal Transports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel hierarchical framework for optimal transport (OT) using string diagrams, namely string diagrams of optimal transports. This framework reduces complex hierarchical OT problems to standard OT problems, allowing efficient synthesis of optimal hierarchical transportation plans. Our approach uses algebraic compositions of cost matrices to effectively model hierarchical structures. We also study an adversarial situation with multiple choices in the cost matrices, where we present a polynomial-time algorithm for a relaxation of the problem. Experimental results confirm the efficiency and performance advantages of our proposed algorithm over the naive method.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

      <title>On the time complexity analysis of numerical percolation threshold estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a variety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to materials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or even quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the calculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as percolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the threshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is decided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which provides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in the projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an exact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site percolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both temporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the aforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate analysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about certain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which along with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the threshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are achieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems spanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is directly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this point has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance. Furthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could be applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been thoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Unified Stochastic Framework for Neural Network Quantization and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are two essential techniques for compressing neural networks, yet they are often treated independently, with limited theoretical analysis connecting them. This paper introduces a unified framework for post-training quantization and pruning using stochastic path-following algorithms. Our approach builds on the Stochastic Path Following Quantization (SPFQ) method, extending its applicability to pruning and low-bit quantization, including challenging 1-bit regimes. By incorporating a scaling parameter and generalizing the stochastic operator, the proposed method achieves robust error correction and yields rigorous theoretical error bounds for both quantization and pruning as well as their combination.</description>

      <title>High-order Accurate Inference on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for statistical inference on Riemannian manifolds that achieves high-order accuracy, addressing the challenges posed by non-Euclidean parameter spaces frequently encountered in modern data science. Our approach leverages a novel and computationally efficient procedure to reach higher-order asymptotic precision. In particular, we develop a bootstrap algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that is both computationally efficient and accurate for hypothesis testing and confidence region construction. Although locational hypothesis testing can be reformulated as a standard Euclidean problem, constructing high-order accurate confidence regions necessitates careful treatment of manifold geometry. To this end, we establish high-order asymptotics under a fixed normal chart centered at the true parameter, thereby enabling precise expansions that incorporate curvature effects. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework across various manifold settings-including spheres, the Stiefel manifold, fixed-rank matrices manifolds, and rank-one tensor manifolds-and, for Euclidean submanifolds, introduce a class of projection-like coordinate charts with strong consistency properties. Finally, numerical studies confirm the practical merits of the proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Comments and extensions on "State-equivalent form and minimum-order compensator design for rectangular descriptor systems"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical note presents a counterexample showing that the equivalence conditions proposed by Geng et al. (IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 2024), which use a minimum-order compensator (MOC) to achieve desired designs, including generalized regularity or both generalized regularity and free of impulse, are sufficient but not necessary. Furthermore, revised equivalence conditions are introduced, along with an equivalence condition ensuring the closed-loop system remains generalized regular, impulse-free, and stable using MOC. Additionally, it is shown that output feedback can replace the MOC, achieving the same design without increasing dimensionality. These findings are validated through a circuit example.</description>
