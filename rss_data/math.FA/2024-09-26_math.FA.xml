      <title>On the closability of class totally paranormal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into the analysis of various spectral properties pertaining to totally paranormal closed operators, extending beyond the confines of boundedness and encompassing operators defined in a Hilbert space. Within this class, closed symmetric operators are included. Initially, we establish that the spectrum of such an operator is non-empty and provide a characterization of closed-range operators in terms of the spectrum. Building on these findings, we proceed to prove Weyl's theorem, demonstrating that for a densely defined closed totally paranormal operator $T$, the difference between the spectrum $\sigma(T)$ and the Weyl spectrum $\sigma_w(T)$ equals the set of all isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicities, denoted by $\pi_{00}(T)$. In the final section, we establish the self-adjointness of the Riesz projection $E_{\mu}$ corresponding to any non-zero isolated spectral value $\mu$ of $T$. Furthermore, we show that this Riesz projection satisfies the relationships $\mathrm{ran}(E_{\mu}) = \n(T-\mu I) = \n(T-\mu I)^*$. Additionally, we demonstrate that if $T$ is a closed totally paranormal operator with a Weyl spectrum $\sigma_w(T) = {0}$, then $T$ qualifies as a compact normal operator.</description>

      <title>A new systems theory perspective on canonical Wiener-Hopf factorization on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish left and right canonical factorizations of Hilbert-space operator-valued functions $G(z)$ that are analytic on neighborhoods of the complex unit circle and the origin 0, and that have the form $G(z)=I+F(z)$ with $F(z)$ taking strictly contractive values on the unit circle. Such functions can be realized as transfer functions of infinite dimensional dichotomous discrete-time linear systems, and we employ the strict bounded real lemma for this class of operators, together with associated Krein space theory, to derive explicit formulas for the left and right canonical factorizations.</description>

      <title>Finite-index phenomena and the topology of bundle singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical branched cover is an open surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces with uniformly bounded finite fibers and analogously, a quantum branched cover is a unital $C^*$ embedding admitting a finite-index expectation. We show that whenever a compact Hausdorff space $Z$ contains a one-point compactification of an uncountable set, the incidence correspondence attached to the space of cardinality-$(\le n)$ subsets of $Z$ (for $n\ge 3$) is a classical branched cover that does not dualize to a quantum one. In particular, when $Z$ is dyadic, the resulting $C^*$ embeddings are quantum branched covers precisely when $Z$ is also metrizable. This provides a partial converse to an earlier result of the author's (to the effect that continuous, unital, subhomogeneous $C^*$ bundles over compact metrizable spaces are quantum branched) and settles negatively a question of Blanchard-Gogi\'{c}.
  There are also some positive results identifying classes of compact Hausdorff spaces (e.g. extremally disconnected or orderable) with the property that all (continuous, unital) $C^*$ bundles based thereon are quantum branched.</description>

      <title>Preserving Besov (fractional Sobolev) energies under sphericalization and flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new sphericalization mapping for metric spaces that is applicable in very general situations, including totally disconnected fractal type sets. For an unbounded complete metric space which is uniformly perfect at a base point for large radii and equipped with a doubling measure, we make a more specific construction based on the measure and equip it with a weighted measure. This mapping is then shown to preserve the doubling property of the measure and the Besov (fractional Sobolev) energy.
  The corresponding results for flattening of bounded complete metric spaces are also obtained. Finally, it is shown that for the composition of a sphericalization with a flattening, or vice versa, the obtained space is biLipschitz equivalent with the original space and the resulting measure is comparable to the original measure.</description>

      <title>Classical inequalities for all Fourier matrix coefficients of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish three fundamental Fourier inequalities: the Hausdorff-Young inequality, the Paley inequality, and the Hausdorff-Young-Paley inequality for $(l, n)$-type functions on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Utilizing these inequalities, we demonstrate the $L^p$-$L^q$ boundedness of $(l, n)$-type Fourier multipliers on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Furthermore, we explore applications related to the $L^p$-$L^q$ estimates of the heat kernel of the Casimir element on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and address the global well-posedness of certain parabolic and hyperbolic nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-$L^q$ Fourier multipliers and Hausdorff-Young-Paley inequalities on Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our primary objective in this article is to establish H\"ormander type $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ Fourier multiplier theorems in the context of noncompact type Riemannian symmetric spaces $\mathbb{X}$ of arbitrary rank for the range $1 &lt; p \leq 2 \leq q &lt; \infty$. As a consequence of the Fourier multiplier theorem, we also derive a spectral multiplier theorem on $\mathbb{X}$. We then apply this theorem to prove $L^p \rightarrow L^q$ boundedness for functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and to obtain embedding theorems and operator estimates for the potentials and heat semigroups. Additionally, we provide mixed-norm versions of the Hausdorff-Young and Paley inequalities. In this context, where the Fourier transform is holomorphic, and its domain consists of various strips, we present two versions of these inequalities and explore their interrelation. Furthermore, our findings and methods are also applicable to harmonic $NA$ groups, also known as Damek-Ricci spaces.</description>

      <title>Solving four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories with Tracy-Widom distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a special class of observables in $\mathcal N=2$ and $\mathcal N=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theories which, for an arbitrary 't Hooft coupling constant $\lambda$, admit representation as determinants of certain semi-infinite matrices. Similar determinants have previously appeared in the study of level-spacing distributions in random matrices and are closely related to the celebrated Tracy-Widom distribution. We exploit this relationship to develop an efficient method for computing the observables in superconformal Yang-Mills theories at both weak and strong coupling. The weak coupling expansion has a finite radius of convergence. The strong coupling expansion involves the sum of the `perturbative' part, given by series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$, and the `non-perturbative' part, given by an infinite sum of exponentially small terms, each accompanied by a series in $1/\sqrt\lambda$ with factorially growing coefficients. We explicitly compute the expansion coefficients of these series and show that they are uniquely determined by the large order behavior of the expansion coefficients of the perturbative part via resurgence relations.</description>

      <title>On isometric universality of spaces of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A metric space $(M, d)$ is said to be universal for a class of metric spaces if all metric spaces in the class can be isometrically embedded into $(M, d)$. In this paper, for a metrizable space $Z$ possessing abundant subspaces, we first prove that the space of bounded metrics on $Z$ is universal for all bounded metric spaces (with restricted cardinality). Next, in contrast, we show that if $Z$ is an infinite discrete space, then the space of metrics on $Z$ is universal for all separable metric spaces. As a corollary of our results, if $Z$ is non-compact, or uncountable and compact, then the space of metrics on $Z$ is universal for all compact metric spaces. In addition, if $Z$ is compact and countable, then there exists a compact metric space that can not be isometrically embedded into the space of metrics on $Z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study redefines the analysis of Devaney chaos in multiple mappings from a set-valued perspective and introduces new conditions to characterize their chaotic behavior. As an innovative advancement, we develop computational algorithms to detect and visualize chaotic features such as transitivity and sensitivity. These algorithms provide tools to explore complex dynamics in higher-dimensional systems, validating theoretical concepts and opening new research avenues in chaos theory.</description>

      <title>General solidity phenomena and anticoarse spaces for type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By developing a theory of anticoarse spaces in the purely infinite setting and using 1-bounded entropy techniques along with recent strong convergence results in random matrix theory, we show that free Araki--Woods factors offer the first examples of type $\mathrm{III}$ factors satisfying vastly general degrees of indecomposability phenomena. Notably this includes strong solidity with respect to any weakening of the normalizer currently in the literature and the Peterson--Thom property.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Trace Formulas for Contractive and Dissipative Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish higher order trace formulas for pairs of contractions along a multiplicative path generated by a self-adjoint operator in a Schatten-von Neumann ideal, removing earlier stringent restrictions on the kernel and defect operator of the contractions and enlarging the set of admissible functions. We also derive higher order trace formulas for maximal dissipative operators under relaxed assumptions and new simplified trace formulas for unitary and resolvent comparable self-adjoint operators. The respective spectral shift measures are absolutely continuous and, in the case of contractions, the set of admissible functions for the $n$th order trace formula on the unit circle includes the Besov class $B^n_{\infty, 1}(\T)$. Both aforementioned properties are new in the mentioned generality.</description>

      <title>Maximal $L_p$-regularity for $x$-dependent fractional heat equations with Dirichlet conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal regularity results in $L_p$-based function spaces in space and time for a large class of linear parabolic equations with a nonlocal elliptic operator in bounded domains with limited smoothness. Here the nonlocal operator is given by a strongly elliptic and even pseudodifferential operator of order $2a$ ($0&lt;a&lt;1$) with nonsmooth $x$-dependent coefficients. This includes the prominent case of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^a$, as well as elliptic operators $(-\nabla \cdot A(x)\nabla+b(x))^a$. The proofs are based on general results on maximal $L_p$-regularity and its relation to $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness of the resolvent of the associated (elliptic) operator. Finally, we apply these results to show existence of strong solutions locally in time for a class of nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations, which include a fractional nonlinear diffusion equation and a fractional porous medium equation after a transformation.
  The nonlinear results are new for operators on domains with boundary; the linear results are so when $P$ is $x$-dependent nonsymmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of Hadamard states for the Maxwell equations on any globally hyperbolic spacetime. This will be achieved by introducing a new gauge fixing condition, the Cauchy radiation gauge, that will allow to suppress all the unphysical degrees of freedom. The key ingredient for achieving this gauge is a new Hodge decomposition for differential k-forms in Sobolev spaces on complete (possibly non-compact) Riemannian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>
