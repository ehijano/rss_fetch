      <title>Representing caregiver burden in observational studies: Development of the Caregiver Burden Index (CareBI) using NSOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Informal caregiving often carries a significant emotional, physical, and financial toll, yet caregiver burden is often underrepresented in healthcare research and methods. Existing caregiver burden instruments, while valuable in clinical research, often lack compatibility with observational datasets regularly used in health services research and planning. This study introduces the Caregiver Burden Index (CareBI) developed for the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), that can be used to represent caregiver burden in quantitative models and observational research studies. CareBI was developed and validated using a multistep process that included the identification and preparation of individual NSOC survey items, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, score estimation, interpretation, and external validation. The study used data from round 12 of the NSOC. CareBI represents three domains of burden: objective, subjective, and interpersonal, providing a comprehensive view of both the positive and negative aspects of caregiving. It also aligns with the Zarit Burden Interview, a widely used tool for prospectively assessing caregiver burden. Construct validity was assessed by comparing CareBI's relationship with caregiver and care recipient outcomes, as well as sensitivity to known burden-related risk and mitigation factors. Early findings affirm the scale's utility in categorizing low-, moderate-, and high-burden caregivers and guiding resource-oriented strategies. CareBI represents a reproducible tool for embedding caregiver metrics into health operations, predictive modeling, and public policy frameworks, and provides a template for applying operations research and industrial engineering methods to psychosocial measurement challenges in aging and long-term care.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis when Generalizing Causal Effects from Multiple Studies to a Target Population: Motivation from the ECHO Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unobserved effect modifiers can induce bias when generalizing causal effect estimates to target populations. In this work, we extend a sensitivity analysis framework assessing the robustness of study results to unobserved effect modification that adapts to various generalizability scenarios, including multiple (conditionally) randomized trials, observational studies, or combinations thereof. This framework is interpretable and does not rely on distributional or functional assumptions about unknown parameters. We demonstrate how to leverage the multi-study setting to detect violation of the generalizability assumption through hypothesis testing, showing with simulations that the proposed test achieves high power under real-world sample sizes. Finally, we apply our sensitivity analysis framework to analyze the generalized effect estimate of secondhand smoke exposure on birth weight using cohort sites from the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) study.</description>

      <title>Forecast reconciliation with non-linear constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for forecasting time series adhering to linear constraints have seen notable development in recent years, especially with the advent of forecast reconciliation. This paper extends forecast reconciliation to the open question of non-linearly constrained time series. Non-linear constraints can emerge with variables that are formed as ratios such as mortality rates and unemployment rates. On the methodological side, Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation (NLCR) is proposed. This algorithm adjusts forecasts that fail to meet non-linear constraints, in a way that ensures the new forecasts meet the constraints. The NLCR method is a projection onto a non-linear surface, formulated as a constrained optimisation problem. On the theoretical side, optimisation methods are again used, this time to derive sufficient conditions for when the NLCR methodology is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy. Finally on the empirical side, NLCR is applied to two datasets from demography and economics and shown to significantly improve forecast accuracy relative to relevant benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Dual approach to proving electoral fraud via statistics and forensics (Dvojnoe dokazatel'stvo falsifikazij na vyborah statistikoj i kriminalistikoj)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electoral fraud often manifests itself as statistical anomalies in election results, yet its extent can rarely be reliably confirmed by other evidence. Here we report complete results of municipal elections in Vlasikha town near Moscow, where we observe both statistical irregularities in the vote-counting transcripts and forensic evidence of tampering with ballots during their overnight storage. We evaluate two types of statistical signatures in the vote sequence that can prove batches of fraudulent ballots have been injected. We find that pairs of factory-made security bags with identical serial numbers are used in this fraud scheme. At 8 out of our 9 polling stations, the statistical and forensic evidence agrees (identifying 7 as fraudulent and 1 as honest), while at the remaining station the statistical evidence detects the fraud while the forensic one is insufficient. We also illustrate that the use of tamper-indicating seals at elections is inherently unreliable.</description>

      <title>The effect of a new power interconnector on energy prices volatility: the case of Sicily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating energy islands into the European electricity market is a key challenge for the energy transition. This study investigates the impact of the Sorgente-Rizziconi interconnector on electricity price volatility in Sicily. Before its commissioning on 28 May 2016, the Sicilian electricity market zone was poorly interconnected with the Italian mainland. Using daily data from 2015 to 2018, the analysis applies a semi-parametric GARCH model with a logistic intervention function to estimate changes in conditional price variance. A fully non-parametric additive model is employed as a robustness check, allowing the data to shape volatility dynamics without imposing a predefined structure. The results reveal that the new interconnector significantly increased price volatility in Sicily, without reducing average price levels. No significant effects were observed in other Italian market zones. These findings highlight the context-dependent nature of infrastructure impacts and suggest that physical integration alone does not guarantee price stability. The results have important implications for energy policy, investment planning, and risk management in electricity markets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Fire Risk Index in Chemical Industry Using Statistical Modeling Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fire incident reports contain detailed textual narratives that capture causal factors often overlooked in structured records, while financial damage amounts provide measurable outcomes of these events. Integrating these two sources of information is essential for uncovering interpretable links between descriptive causes and their economic consequences. To this end, we develop a data-driven framework that constructs a composite Risk Index, enabling systematic quantification of how specific keywords relate to property damage amounts. This index facilitates both the identification of high-impact terms and the aggregation of risks across semantically related clusters, thereby offering a principled measure of fire-related financial risk. Using more than a decade of Korean fire investigation reports on the chemical industry classified as Special Buildings (2013 through 2024), we employ topic modeling and network-based embedding to estimate semantic similarities from interactions among words and subsequently apply Lasso regression to quantify their associations with property damage amounts, thereby estimate fire risk index. This approach enables us to assess fire risk not only at the level of individual terms but also within their broader textual context, where highly interactive related words provide insights into collective patterns of hazard representation and their potential impact on expected losses. The analysis highlights several domains of risk, including hazardous chemical leakage, unsafe storage practices, equipment and facility malfunctions, and environmentally induced ignition. The results demonstrate that text-derived indices provide interpretable and practically relevant insights, bridging unstructured narratives with structured loss information and offering a basis for evidence-based fire risk assessment and management.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach based on survival analysis for IBNR frequencies in non-life reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new approaches for forecasting IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) frequencies by leveraging individual claims data, which includes accident date, reporting delay, and possibly additional features for every reported claim. A key element of our proposal involves computing development factors, which may be influenced by both the accident date and other features. These development factors serve as the basis for predictions. While we assume close to continuous observations of accident date and reporting delay, the development factors can be expressed at any level of granularity, such as months, quarters, or year and predictions across different granularity levels exhibit coherence. The calculation of development factors relies on the estimation of a hazard function in reverse development time, and we present three distinct methods for estimating this function: the Cox proportional hazard model, a feed-forward neural network, and eXtreme gradient boosting. In all three cases, estimation is based on the same partial likelihood that accommodates left truncation and ties in the data. While the first case is a semi-parametric model that assumes in parts a log linear structure, the two machine learning approaches only assume that the baseline and the other factors are multiplicatively separable. Through an extensive simulation study and real-world data application, our approach demonstrates promising results.</description>

      <title>Post-processing of wind gusts from COSMO-REA6 with a spatial Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>Index insurance under demand and solvency constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Index insurance is often proposed to reduce protection gaps, especially for emerging risks. Unlike traditional insurance, it bases compensation on a measurable index, enabling faster payouts and lower claim management costs. This approach benefits both policyholders, through quick payments, and insurers, through reduced costs and better risk control due to reliable data and robust statistical estimates. An important difference with the concept of Cat Bonds is that the feasibility of such coverage relies on the possibility of mutualization. Mutualization, in turn, is achieved only if a sufficiently high number of policyholders agree to subscribe. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a model for the demand for index insurance and to provide conditions under which the solvency of the portfolio is achieved. From these conditions, we deduce a product that combines index and traditional indemnity insurance in order to benefit from the best of both approaches. We illustrate our results with a practical example involving the design of an index insurance product in the field of cyber insurance.</description>
