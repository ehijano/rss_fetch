      <title>Topological transitions in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address issues related to the presence of defects at topological transitions, in particular when defects are modeled in terms of further variables associated with a quenched disorder, corresponding to the limit in which the defect dynamics is very slow. As a paradigmatic model, we consider the three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge model in the presence of quenched uncorrelated disorder associated with the plaquettes of the lattice, whose topological transitions are characterized by the absence of a local order parameter. We study the critical behaviors in the presence of weak disorder. We show that they belong to a new topological universality class, different from that of the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge models without disorder, in agreement with the Harris criterium for the relevance of uncorrelated quenched disorder when the pure system undergoes a continuous transition with positive specific-heat critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Polychronous Wave Computing: Timing-Native Address Selection in Spiking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike timing offers a combinatorial address space, suggesting that timing-based spiking inference can be executed as lookup and routing rather than as dense multiply--accumulate. Yet most neuromorphic and photonic systems still digitize events into timestamps, bins, or rates and then perform selection in clocked logic. We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch. PWC provides a fast routing coprocessor for LUT-style spiking networks and sparse top-1 gates (e.g., mixture-of-experts routing) across polaritonic, photonic, and oscillator platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Avalanche Stability of Many-Body Localization with Power-Law Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of the many-body localized phase against quantum avalanche instabilities in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with long-range power-law interactions ($V\propto r^{-\alpha}$). By combining exact diagonalization of static properties with Lindblad master equation simulations of open-system dynamics, we systematically map the interplay between interaction range and disorder strength. Our finite-size scaling analysis of entanglement entropy identifies a critical interaction exponent $\alpha_c \approx 2$, which separates a fragile regime, characterized by an exponentially diverging critical disorder, from a robust short-range regime. To rigorously test the system's resistance to avalanches, we couple the boundary to an infinite-temperature bath and track the propagation of the thermalization front into the localized bulk. We find that the characteristic thermalization time follows a unified scaling law, $T_{r_{\text{th}}} \sim \exp[\kappa(\alpha) LW]$ (herein, $L$ is the system size, and $W$ is the disorder intensity), which diverges exponentially with the product of system size and disorder strength. This suppression enables the derivation of a quantitative stability criterion, $W_{\text{stab}}(\alpha)$, representing the minimum critical disorder strength required to maintain avalanche stability. Our results confirm that the MBL phase remains asymptotically stable in the thermodynamic limit when disorder exceeds an interaction-dependent threshold, bridging theoretical debates on long-range MBL and providing a roadmap for observing these dynamics in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on disorder-induced topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological states of matter in disordered systems without translation symmetry have attracted great interest in recent years. These states with topological characters are not only robust against certain disorders, but also can be counterintuitively induced by disorders from a topologically trivial phase in the clean limit. In this review, we summarize the current theoretical and experimental progress on disorder-induced topological phases in both condensed-matter and artificial systems. We first introduce the topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) induced by random disorders and their topological characterizations and experimental realizations. We then discuss various extensions of TAIs with unique localization phenomena in quasiperiodic and non-Hermitian systems. We also review the theoretical and experimental studies on the disorder-induced topology in dynamical and many-body systems, including topological Anderson-Thouless pumps, disordered correlated topological insulators and average-symmetry protected topological orders acting as interacting TAI phases. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting potential directions for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator and reentrant topological transitions in a mosaic trimer lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic-potential-modulated mosaic trimer lattice. To begin with, we first investigate the topological properties of the model in the clean limit free of quasiperiodic disorder based on analytical derivation and numerical calculations of the Zak phase $Z$ and the polarization $P$. Two nontrivial topological phases corresponding to the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling, respectively, are revealed. Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</description>

      <title>The CP-PAW code package for first-principles calculations from a user's perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP-PAW is a combined electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics code to perform mixed quantum and classical simulations of atomistic condensed phase systems, such as solids, liquids, and molecular systems. As the name suggests, the CP-PAW code unifies the all-electron projector augmented-wave method with the Car-Parrinello approach to determine not only the electronic and nuclear ground state of condensed matter, but also to study their properties and dynamics. In addition to briefly outlining the underlying theory, the focus will be on unique aspects of CP-PAW and how to correctly employ them as a user. How to install CP-PAW using the new build system will also be briefly mentioned.</description>

Abstract: In a recent letter [T. D. K\"uhne, M. Krack, F. Mohamed and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 066401 (2007)], we outlined a new Car-Parrinello-like approach to Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. Here, we provide a guide to performing actual calculations using our method and demonstrate this on liquid water at ambient conditions. We do not go into methodological details beyond those necessary for applying this approach, but focus on practical details pertinent to our particular implementation within the CP2K/Quickstep code [T. D. K\"uhne et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)].</description>

      <title>Operator delocalization in disordered spin chains via exact MPO marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator delocalization in disordered one-dimensional spin chains by introducing -- besides the already known operator mass -- a complementary measure of operator complexity: the operator length. Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy flow controls the stability of multitrophic ecosystems with stratified nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems with nonreciprocal interactions are often stratified into layers. Ecosystems are a prime example, where species at one trophic level grow by consuming those at another. Yet the dynamical consequences of such stratified nonreciprocity -- where the correlation between growth and consumption differs across trophic levels -- remain unexplored. Here, using an ecological model with three trophic levels, we reveal an emergent asymmetry: nonreciprocal interactions between consumers and predators (top and middle level) destabilize ecosystems far more readily than nonreciprocity between consumers and resources (middle and bottom level). We analytically derive the phase diagram for the model and show that its stability boundary is controlled by energy flow across trophic levels. Because energy flows upward -- from resources to predators -- diversity is progressively lower at higher trophic levels, which we show explains the asymmetry. Lowering energy flow efficiency flips the asymmetry toward resources and remarkably expands the stable region of the phase diagram, suggesting that the famous "10% energy transfer" seen in natural ecosystems might promote stability. More broadly, our findings show that the location of nonreciprocity within a complex network, not merely its magnitude, determines stability.</description>

      <title>Griffiths-like region explains the dynamic anomaly in metallic glass-forming liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex fluids such as water exhibits many anomalous phenomena, and research suggests these properties are closely tied to critical fluctuations near the liquid-liquid phase transition critical point (LLCP). However, whether a similar LLCP exists in metallic glass-forming liquids, which are notable for their high atomic coordination, remains an open question. Although dynamic anomalies such as the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation have often been attributed to dynamic heterogeneity or structural changes, relatively few studies have analyzed these anomalies from a thermodynamic-fluctuation perspective. This gap probably stems from the challenges in detecting density-driven phase transitions in such systems. Here, we use numerical simulations to explore the thermodynamic mechanisms behind dynamic anomalies in a prototypical metallic glass-forming melt. We observe substantial thermodynamic fluctuations near a particular region, which likely corresponds to a frustration state of liquid, vapor, and glass. These fluctuations may contribute to the violation of the SE relation. Our findings offer a fresh Griffiths-like perspective on the dynamic anomalies seen in supercooled metallic liquids, and shed new light on their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Programmable branched flow of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic control of branched flow of light using anisotropic nematic liquid crystals. By sculpting the director field via photoalignment, we create spatially programmable optical potentials that govern light scattering and propagation. This platform enables configurable, anisotropic branched flow of light and reveals a universal scaling law for its characteristic features, directly connecting disordered photonics with mesoscopic wave transport. Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading. These findings establish a tunable material platform for harnessing branched flow of light, opening pathways toward on-chip photonic circuits that exploit disorder-guided transport, scattering-resilient endoscopic imaging, and adaptive optical interfaces in complex media.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pontus-Mpemba Effect Enabled by the Liouvillian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unveil a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect enabled by the Liouvillian skin effect in a dissipative tight-binding chain with asymmetric incoherent hopping and coherent boundary coupling. The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\rm R} \neq J_{\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $\epsilon$. For $\epsilon=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $\epsilon=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\rm R}=J_{\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes. Our results reveal a clear connection between boundary-induced non-normality and protocol-dependent relaxation acceleration, suggesting new routes for controlling dissipation and transient dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</description>

      <title>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that transfer tensor memory effects arise to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux".

      <title>Noise-induced resonant acceleration of a charge in an intermittent magnetic field: an exact solution for ergodic and non-ergodic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we show, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization on Husimi Trees and its implications for Many-Body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the analogy between many-body localization (MBL) and single-particle Anderson localization on hierarchical graphs, we study localization on the Husimi tree, a generalization of the Bethe lattice with a finite density of local loops of arbitrary but finite length. The exact solution of the model provides a transparent and quantitative framework to systematically inspect the effect of loops on localization. Our analysis indicates that local loops enhance resonant processes, thereby reducing the critical disorder with increasing their number and size. At the same time, loops promote local hybridization, leading to an increase in the spatial extent of localized eigenstates. These effects reconcile key discrepancies between MBL phenomenology and its single-particle Anderson analog. These results show that local loops are a crucial structural ingredient for realistic single-particle analogies to many-body Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Instability cascades in crumpling mylar sheets follow a log-Poisson statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Using extensive simulations to generate long time-series of such buckling events, we show that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material characterized by a logarithmically growing length-scale. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</description>

      <title>Emergent Thermalization Thresholds in Unitary Dynamics of Inhomogeneously Disordered Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the avalanche scenario for many-body localization (MBL) instability, we reverse the conventional set-up and ask whether a large weakly-disordered chain can thermalize a smaller, strongly-disordered chain when the composite system evolves unitarily. Using transport as a dynamical probe, we identify three distinct thermalization regimes as a function of the disorder strength of the smaller chain: (i) complete thermalization with self-averaging at weak disorder, (ii) realization-dependent thermalization with strong sample-to-sample fluctuations at intermediate disorder, and (iii) absence of thermalization at strong disorder. We find that for a fixed length of the smaller chain, the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size. These results highlight how inhomogeneous disorder can induce emergent thermalization thresholds in closed quantum systems, providing direct access to disorder regimes where thermalization or its absence can be reliably observed.</description>

      <title>Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates charge-neutral, large random density fluctuations $\delta n/n_0 \gg 1$, and corresponding fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$ (random plasma density grating). Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. {In the linear regime, the instability can be classified as Induced Brillouin Scattering; it is described by the parameter $\rho _L = \left( a_0 { \omega_{p}/ }{\omega}\right)^{2/3} \leq 1 $, related to the Pierce parameter of Free Electron Lasers. In the cold case, the growth rate is $\Gamma \approx \rho _{L} \omega$ ($a_0 $ is laser nonlinearity parameter, $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency, $\omega$ is the laser frequency). } Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread with $\Theta \equiv k_B T/(m_e c^2) \approx a_0^2$, restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. Time-variability of the resulting density structures does not suppress localization due to remaining corrections (not white noise). We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Gauge-steerable Edge Modes In Non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify steerable exponentially localized in-gap mode in a quasiperiodic non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain with a spatially fluctuating, zero-mean imaginary gauge field. Under open boundary conditions, the system is exactly related to the Hermitian AAH model by a nonunitary gauge transformation: the OBC spectrum and Lyapunov exponents are unchanged, while eigenstates acquire a gauge-dependent envelope. In a parameter region with spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we find two exponentially localized in-gap modes with sharply different responses to the imaginary gauge field. One remains boundary pinned, but the other is gauge-steerable: it stays exponentially localized while its probability maximum shifts as the gauge field is changed, with its eigenenergy unchanged. We further show that weak on-site gain, applied at a single site chosen once and then kept fixed, can dynamically prepare this steerable mode from a generic bulk wave packet. Changing the gauge field then yields exponentially localized states at different locations.</description>
