      <title>Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserving original cubic hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the set of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields for which their associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. We analyze these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also study a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we explore several properties like the existence of additional first integrals of specific type, the possibility that the initial Hamiltonian vector field is a Lie Symmetry of the corresponding map, or the symplecticity of the considered maps.</description>

      <title>Li\'{e}nard Type Nonlinear Oscillators and Quantum Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li\'{e}nard-type nonlinear oscillators with linear and nonlinear damping terms exhibit diverse dynamical behavior in both the classical and quantum regimes. In this paper, we consider examples of various one-dimensional Li\'{e}nard type-I and type-II oscillators. The associated Euler-Lagrange equations are divided into groups based on the characteristics of the damping and forcing terms. The Li\'{e}nard type-I oscillators often display localized solutions, isochronous and non-isochronous oscillations and are also precisely solvable in quantum mechanics in general, where the ordering parameters play an important role. These include Mathews-Lakshmanan and Higgs oscillators. However, the classical solutions of some of the nonlinear oscillators are expressed in terms of elliptic functions and have been found to be quasi-exactly solvable in the quantum region. The three-dimensional generalizations of these classical systems add more degrees of freedom, which show complex dynamics. Their quantum equivalents are also explored in this article. The isotonic generalizations of the non-isochronous nonlinear oscillators have also been solved both classically and quantum mechanically to advance the studies. The modified Emden equation categorized as Li\'{e}nard type-II exhibits isochronous oscillations at the classical level. This property makes it a valuable tool for studying the underlying nonlinear dynamics. The study on the quantum counterpart of the system provides a deeper understanding of the behavior in the quantum realm as a typical PT-symmetric system.</description>

      <title>$Q$-Boson model and relations with integrable hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the intricate relationship between the q-boson model, a quantum integrable system, and classical integrable systems such as the Toda and KP hierarchies. Initially, we analyze scalar products of off-shell Bethe states and explore their connections to tau functions of integrable hierarchies. Furthermore, we discuss correlation functions within this formalism, examining their representations in terms of tau functions, as well as their Schur polynomial expansions.</description>
