      <title>Element-Free Probability Distributions and Random Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An "element-free" probability distribution is what remains of a probability distribution after we forget the elements to which the probabilities were assigned. These objects naturally arise in Bayesian statistics, in situations where elements are used as labels and their specific identity is not important.
  This paper develops the structural theory of element-free distributions, using multisets and category theory. We give operations for moving between element-free and ordinary distributions, and we show that these operations commute with multinomial sampling. We then exploit this theory to prove two representation theorems. These theorems show that element-free distributions provide a natural representation for key random structures in Bayesian nonparametric clustering: exchangeable random partitions, and random distributions parametrized by a base measure.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and P\'olya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Wasserstein distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Wasserstein distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Wasserstein distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the draw size increases, the Wasserstein distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel manner as limits of Wasserstein distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>Natural numbers from integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In homotopy type theory, a natural number type is freely generated by an element and an endomorphism. Similarly, an integer type is freely generated by an element and an automorphism. Using only dependent sums, identity types, extensional dependent products, and a type of two elements with large elimination, we construct a natural number type from an integer type. As a corollary, homotopy type theory with only $\Sigma$, $\mathsf{Id}$, $\Pi$, and finite colimits with descent (and no universes) admits a natural number type. This improves and simplifies a result by Rose.</description>

      <title>Towards Practicable Algorithms for Rewriting Graph Queries beyond DL-Lite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the many advantages that ontology-based data access (OBDA) has brought to a range of application domains, state-of-the-art OBDA systems still do not support popular graph database management systems such as Neo4j. Algorithms for query rewriting focus on languages like conjunctive queries and their unions, which are fragments of first-order logic and were developed for relational data. Such query languages are poorly suited for querying graph data. Moreover, they also limit the expressiveness of the ontology languages that admit rewritings, restricting them to those where the data complexity of reasoning is not higher than it is in first-order logic. In this paper, we propose a technique for rewriting a family of navigational queries for a suitably restricted fragment of ELHI that extends DL-Lite and that is NL-complete in data complexity. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that rewrites into Cypher queries, and tested it on a real-world cognitive neuroscience use case with promising results.</description>

      <title>Infinitary cut-elimination via finite approximations (extended version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non-wellfounded proof systems based on parsimonious logic, a weaker variant of linear logic where the exponential modality ! is interpreted as a constructor for streams over finite data. Logical consistency is maintained at a global level by adapting a standard progressing criterion. We present an infinitary version of cut-elimination based on finite approximations, and we prove that, in presence of the progressing criterion, it returns well-defined non-wellfounded proofs at its limit. Furthermore, we show that cut-elimination preserves the progressive criterion and various regularity conditions internalizing degrees of proof-theoretical uniformity. Finally, we provide a denotational semantics for our systems based on the relational model.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Restarts of CDCL: Should the Search Information be Preserved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SAT solvers are indispensable in formal verification for hardware and software with many important applications. CDCL is the most widely used framework for modern SAT solvers, and restart is an essential technique of CDCL. When restarting, CDCL solvers cancel the current variable assignment while maintaining the branching order, variable phases, and learnt clauses. This type of restart is referred to as warm restart in this paper. Although different restart policies have been studied, there is no study on whether such information should be kept after restarts. This work addresses this question and finds some interesting observations.
  This paper indicates that under this popular warm restart scheme, there is a substantial variation in run-time with different randomized initial orders and phases, which motivates us to forget some learned information periodically to prevent being stuck in a disadvantageous search space. We propose a new type of restart called cold restart, which differs from previous restarts by forgetting some of the learned information. Experiments show that modern CDCL solvers can benefit from periodically conducting cold restarts. Based on the analysis of the cold-restart strategies, we develop a parallel SAT solver. Both the sequential and parallel versions of cold restart are more suitable for satisfiable instances, which suggests that existing CDCL heuristics for information management should be revised if one hopes to construct a satisfiable-oriented SAT solver.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Mathematical Operational Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compositionality proofs in higher-order languages are notoriously involved, and general semantic frameworks guaranteeing compositionality are hard to come by. In particular, Turi and Plotkin's bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework, which provides off-the-shelf compositionality results for first-order languages, so far does not apply to higher-order languages. In the present work, we develop a theory of abstract GSOS specifications for higher-order languages, in effect transferring the core principles of Turi and Plotkin's framework to a higher-order setting. In our theory, the operational semantics of higher-order languages is represented by certain dinatural transformations that we term \emph{(pointed) higher-order GSOS laws}. We give a general compositionality result that applies to all systems specified in this way and discuss how compositionality of combinatory logics and the $\lambda$-calculus w.r.t.\ a strong variant of Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity are obtained as instances.</description>

      <title>Non-accessible localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a 2005 paper, Casacuberta, Scevenels and Smith construct a homotopy idempotent functor $E$ on the category of simplicial sets with the property that whether it can be expressed as localization with respect to a map $f$ is independent of the ZFC axioms. We show that this construction can be carried out in homotopy type theory. More precisely, we give a general method of associating to a suitable (possibly large) family of maps, a reflective subuniverse of any universe $\mathcal{U}$. When specialized to an appropriate family, this produces a localization which when interpreted in the $\infty$-topos of spaces agrees with the localization corresponding to $E$. Our approach generalizes the approach of [CSS] in two ways. First, by working in homotopy type theory, our construction can be interpreted in any $\infty$-topos. Second, while the local objects produced by [CSS] are always 1-types, our construction can produce $n$-types, for any $n$. This is new, even in the $\infty$-topos of spaces. In addition, by making use of universes, our proof is very direct.
  Along the way, we prove many results about "small" types that are of independent interest. As an application, we give a new proof that separated localizations exist. We also give results that say when a localization with respect to a family of maps can be presented as localization with respect to a single map, and show that the simplicial model satisfies a strong form of the axiom of choice which implies that sets cover and that the law of excluded middle holds.</description>

      <title>Countability constraints in order-theoretic approaches to computability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computability on uncountable sets has no standard formalization, unlike that on countable sets, which is given by Turing machines. Some of the approaches to define computability in these sets rely on order-theoretic structures to translate such notions from Turing machines to uncountable spaces. Since these machines are used as a baseline for computability in these approaches, countability restrictions on the ordered structures are fundamental. Here, we show several relations between the usual countability restrictions in order-theoretic theories of computability and some more common order-theoretic countability constraints, like order density properties and functional characterizations of the order structure in terms of multi-utilities. As a result, we show how computability can be introduced in some order structures via countability order density and multi-utility constraints.</description>

      <title>Towards solid abelian groups: A formal proof of N\"obeling's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, is a new way of studying the interplay between algebra and geometry. It replaces the concept of a topological space by a more sophisticated but better-behaved idea, namely that of a condensed set. Central to the theory are solid abelian groups and liquid vector spaces, analogues of complete topological groups.
  N\"obeling's theorem, a surprising result from the 1960s about the structure of the abelian group of continuous maps from a profinite space to the integers, is a crucial ingredient in the theory of solid abelian groups; without it one cannot give any nonzero examples of solid abelian groups. We discuss a recently completed formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and give a more detailed proof than those previously available in the literature. The proof is somewhat unusual in that it requires induction over ordinals -- a technique which has not previously been used to a great extent in formalised mathematics.</description>
