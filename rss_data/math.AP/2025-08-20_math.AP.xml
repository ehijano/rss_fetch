      <title>The vanishing viscosity process for an eikonal equation in the radially symmetric setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the vanishing viscosity method for the eikonal equation $|Du|=V$ in $B(0,1)$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary value condition. By assuming $V$ is radially symmetric and restricting attention to radially symmetric solutions, we construct explicit formulas for both the viscous solution $u^{\epsilon}$ and the limiting solution $u$. We prove $u^{\epsilon}\rightarrow u$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ qualitatively and quantitatively derive an $\epsilon |\log \epsilon|$ type local convergence rate. Finally, we discuss the uniqueness of viscosity solutions for the eikonal equation and give some examples.</description>

      <title>The Hardy spaces $\mathcal{H}^{p}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for Fourier integral operators for $p&lt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Hardy spaces $\mathcal{H}^{p}_{FIO}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ for Fourier integral operators for $0&lt;p&lt;1$, thereby extending earlier constructions for $1\leq p\leq \infty$. We then establish various properties of these spaces, including their behavior under complex interpolation and duality, and their invariance under Fourier integral operators. We also obtain Sobolev embeddings, equivalent characterizations, and a molecular decomposition. These spaces are used in the companion article arXiv:2502.02511 to determine the sharp $\mathcal{H}^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ and $\mathrm{bmo}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ regularity of wave equations with rough coefficients.</description>

      <title>An Elliptic-Parabolic Free Boundary Problem with Discontinuous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic-parabolic free boundary problem that models the fluid flow through a partially saturated porous medium. The free boundary arises as the interface separating the saturated and unsaturated regions. Our main goal is to investigate, for the 1+1 dimensional model, how jump discontinuities on the boundary and initial data influence the regularity of both the solution and the free boundary. We show that if the data is merely bounded, then weak solutions are Lipschitz in space and $C^{1/2}$ in time in the unsaturated region. Moreover, the free boundary is locally the graph of a $C^{1/2}$ function, and this regularity is optimal. We view this analysis as a stepping stone towards the study of local regularization for higher-dimensional elliptic-parabolic free boundaries.</description>

      <title>D-tensor paraproducts and its caricatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the $2$-tensor paraproduct decomposition result of arXiv:2503.12629 to $d$-tensors and expound on its caricatures. In particular, we show that for $A \in C^{d}, f \in \Lambda^{\alpha}([0,1]^d)$, $A(f)$ has an approximation $\tilde{A}(f) = (\sum_{\alpha=1}^d A^{\alpha}(P^{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_d}(f)) \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{\alpha}(f) ) $ for a fixed sequence of scales, $\mathbf{j} = (j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_d)$, and the series $\sum_{\alpha=1}^d A^{\alpha}(P^{j_1,j_2, \ldots, j_d}(f)) \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^{\alpha}(f) $ is a taylor expansion of $A$. Additionally, we show the sequence of operators $(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^1(f),\tilde{\mathbf{v}}^2(f), \ldots, \tilde{\mathbf{v}}^d(f))$ form a basis for the subspace comprised of linear functionals of the form $A(f)$, and the residual, $\Delta(A,f) = \tilde{A}(f) - A(f) \in \Lambda^{2\alpha}([0,1]^d)$. Consequentially, we show one can obtain a Calderon-Zygmund type decomposition, $\Delta(A,f)_\lambda + \tilde{A}(f)_{\lambda}$ with the obtained paraproduct decomposition $A(f) = \Delta(A,f) + \tilde{A}(f)$. Our theoretical findings are supported by computational examples for d=2,3.</description>

      <title>Estimates for pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper finishes the goal of the authors started in two previous manuscripts dedicated to revisiting the continuity properties of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with symbols in the H\"ormander classes. Here we prove pointwise estimates in terms of the Fefferman-Stein sharp maximal function and of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Combining these estimates with the properties of Muckenhoupt's weight class $A_p$ we obtain boundedness theorems for pseudo-differential operators between weighted Lebesgue spaces on the torus $L^p(w)$. These results are given in the context of the global symbolic analysis defined on $\mathbb{T}^n\times \mathbb{Z}^n$ as developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen by using discrete Fourier analysis, and extend those of Park and Tomita available in the Euclidean case. Moreover, we include continuity results on Sobolev spaces $W^s_p$ and on Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}$ on the torus. Our techniques are taken from Park and Tomita \cite{park-tomita} and we consider its toroidal extension here for the completeness of the boundedness of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with respect to the current literature.</description>

      <title>A Hele-Shaw problem with interior and free boundary oscillation: well-posedness and homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem in one spatial dimension, where heterogeneities appear both on the free boundary and within the interior of the positivity set. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish well-posedness and a comparison principle for the problem by introducing a novel notion of viscosity flows. Second, under the assumption that the coefficients are stationary ergodic, we prove a stochastic homogenization result. Our results are new even in the periodic setting. To derive the effective free boundary velocity, we use a new approximation that accounts for both interior homogenization and free boundary propagation.</description>

      <title>Non-radial solutions for the critical quasi-linear H\'{e}non equation involving $p$-Laplacian in $\R^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the following $D^{1,p}$-critical quasi-linear H\'enon equation involving $p$-Laplacian \begin{equation*}\label{00} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta_p u=|x|^{\alpha}u^{p_\al^*-1}, &amp; x\in \R^N, \\ &amp;u&gt;0, &amp; x\in \R^N, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $N\geq2$, $1&lt;p&lt;N$, $p_\al^*:=\frac{p(N+\al)}{N-p}$ and $\alpha&gt;0$. By carefully studying the linearized problem and applying the approximation method and bifurcation theory, we prove that, when the parameter $\al$ takes the critical values $\al(k):=\frac{p\sqrt{(N+p-2)^2+4(k-1)(p-1)(k+N-1)}-p(N+p-2)}{2(p-1)}$ for $k\geq2$, the above quasi-linear H\'enon equation admits non-radial solutions $u$ such that $u\sim |x|^{-\frac{N-p}{p-1}}$ and $|\nabla u|\sim |x|^{-\frac{N-1}{p-1}}$ at $\infty$. One should note that, $\alpha(k)=2(k-1)$ for $k\geq2$ when $p=2$. Our results successfully extend the classical work of F. Gladiali, M. Grossi, and S. L. N. Neves in \cite{GGN} concerning the Laplace operator (i.e., the case $p=2$) to the more general setting of the nonlinear $p$-Laplace operator ($1&lt;p&lt;N$). We overcome a series of crucial difficulties, including the nonlinear feature of the $p$-Laplacian $\Delta_p$, the absence of Kelvin type transforms and the lack of the Green integral representation formula.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of simple eigenvalues of particle-in-well systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle in a well in dimension one is a classical problem in quantum mechanics. We study higher-dimensional analogues of the problem, where the well is a smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that simple eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator depend smoothly on the square root $h$ of the inverse depth of the well and provide an explicit first-order expansion of the eigenvalues at $h = 0$.
  Our proof consists of two steps. In the first step, we construct $\mathcal{O}(h^\infty)$ quasimodes (approximate eigenfunctions) on a resolution of $[0, 1)_h\times\mathbb{R}^d$ which allows us to capture fine structure near the boundary of the well. The second step corrects these quasimodes to true eigenfunctions via a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Geometric spectral properties of electromagnetic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a reference homogeneous and isotropic electromagnetic waveguide with a simply connected cross-section embedded in a perfect conductor. In this setting, when the waveguide is straight, the spectrum of the associated self-adjoint Maxwell operator with a constant twist (which may be zero) lies on the real line and is symmetric with respect to zero and exhibits a spectral gap around the origin. Moreover, the spectrum is purely essential, and contains 0 which is an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity. In this work, we present new results on the effects of geometric deformations, specifically bending and twisting, on the spectrum of the Maxwell operator. More precisely, we provide, on the one hand, sufficient conditions on the asymptotic behavior of curvature and twist that ensure the preservation of the essential spectrum of the reference waveguide. Our approach relies on a Birman-Schwinger-type principle, which may be of independent interest and applicable in other contexts. On the other hand, we give sufficient conditions (involving in particular the geometrical shape of the cross-section of the waveguide) so that the geometrical deformation creates discrete spectrum (namely isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity) within the gap of the essential spectrum. In addition, we give some results on the localization of these discrete eigenvalues. The sufficient condition involving the cross-section is then studied both analytically and numerically. Finally, we examine its stability under shape deformations of the cross-section, focusing in particular on the case of a waveguide with a rectangular cross-section.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the inviscid resistive isentropic compressible MHD system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the absence of dissipation mechanism to the inviscid compressible systems, it is a challenging problem to prove their global solvability. In this paper, we are concerned with the initial-boundary value problem to the inviscid and resistive isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system on three dimensional torus $\mathbb T^3$. Global well-posedness and large time behavior of solutions are established in the first time for the isentropic setting, under the condition that the initial data $(\rho_0, u_0, H_0)$ is a small perturbation around the constant state $(1, 0, w)$, with $w$ satisfying the Diophantine condition. The main observation of this paper is that the spatial derivatives of the density along directions perpendicular to $w$ are dissipated. Such dissipation mechanism is generated from the interaction between the velocity field and the background magnetic field. This verifies the weak stabilizing effects of the magnetic filed on the dynamics in the scenario of inviscid isentropic flows. Due to different dissipation mechanisms for the density, velocity, and magnetic field, three ties of dissipative energies are designed, that is, high order Sobolev norms of the perturbed magnetic field, intermediate order Sobolev norms of the perturbed density, and low order Sobolev norms of the velocity field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-fractional parabolic equation of doubly nonlinear type, featuring nonlinear terms both inside and outside the differential operator in time. The main nonlinearities are maximal monotone graphs, without restrictions on the growth. In addition, a Lipschitz continuous perturbation is considered. The existence of global weak solutions is obtained via a regularization and Galerkin approximation method. Uniqueness is also discussed under some additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Geodesic convexity and strengthened functional inequalities in submanifolds of Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geodesic convexity of various energy and entropy functionals restricted to (non-geodesically convex) submanifolds of Wasserstein spaces with their induced geometry. We prove a variety of convexity results by means of a simple general principle, which holds in the metric space setting, and which crucially requires no knowledge of the structure of geodesics in the submanifold: If the EVI gradient flow of a functional exists and leaves the submanifold invariant, then the restriction of the functional to the submanifold is geodesically convex. This leads to short new proofs of several known results, such as one of Carlen and Gangbo on strong convexity of entropy on sphere-like submanifolds, and several new results, such as the $\lambda$-convexity of entropy on the space of couplings of $\lambda$-log-concave marginals. Along the way, we develop sufficient conditions for existence of geodesics in Wasserstein submanifolds. Submanifold convexity results lead systematically to improvements of Talagrand and HWI inequalities which we speculate to be closely related to concentration of measure estimates for conditioned empirical measures, and we prove one rigorous result in this direction in the Carlen-Gangbo setting.</description>

      <title>Reaction enhancement by flux-limited chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in a variety of processes in biology and ecology. Quite often it acts to improve efficiency of biological reactions; one example is the immune system signalling, where infected tissues release chemokines attracting monocytes to fight invading bacteria. Another example is reproduction, where eggs release pheromones that attract sperm. In this paper, we analyze a system of two reacting densities, one of which is chemotactic on another. Since the speed of any biological agents is limited, we employ flux limited chemotaxis model. Our main result is the rigorous derivation of the scaling laws showing how presence of chemotaxis affects the typical reaction time scale. This work builds on the results of \cite{kiselev2022chemotaxis}, which employed a classical Keller-Segel chemotaxis term (not flux limited) - leading to the effect of possible over concentration and restricting the results to radial data. The model presented here is more reasonable biologically and covers broader parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic minimality of one-dimensional transition profiles in Aviles-Giga type models: an approach via 1-currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For vector fields on a two-dimensional domain, we study the asymptotic behaviour of Modica-Mortola (or Allen-Cahn) type functionals under the assumption that the divergence converges to $0$ at a certain rate, which effectively produces a model of Aviles-Giga type. This problem will typically give rise to transition layers, which degenerate into discontinuities in the limit. We analyse the energy concentration at these discontinuities and the corresponding transition profiles.
  We derive an estimate for the energy concentration in terms of a novel geometric variational problem involving the notion of $\mathbb{R}^2$-valued $1$-currents from geometric measure theory. This in turn leads to criteria, under which the energetically favourable transition profiles are essentially one-dimensional.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a double-phase Neumann problem with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, where the lowest exponent $p$ is equal to 1. The existence of a solution is established as the limit of solutions to corresponding double-phase problems with $p&gt;1$. We also provide a variational characterization of the limit.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hardy and spectral gap inequalities on special irreversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sharpness of various Hardy-type inequalities is well-understood in the reversible Finsler setting; while infinite reversibility implies the failure of these functional inequalities, cf. Krist\'aly, Huang, and Zhao [Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 2020]. However, in the remaining case of irreversible manifolds with finite reversibility, there is no evidence on the sharpness of Hardy-type inequalities. In fact, we are not aware of any particular examples where the sharpness persists. In this paper we present two such examples involving two celebrated inequalities: the classical/weighted Hardy inequality (assuming non-positive flag curvature) and the McKean-type spectral gap estimate (assuming strong negative flag curvature). In both cases, we provide a family of Finsler metric measure manifolds on which these inequalities are sharp. We also establish some sufficient conditions, which guarantee the sharpness of more involved Hardy-type inequalities on these spaces. Our relevant technical tool is a Finslerian extension of the method of Riccati pairs (for proving Hardy inequalities), which also inspires the main ideas of our constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the three-wave and four-wave kinetic equations into the GENERIC framework and formally derive a small-angle limit for the four-wave equation. This limit is akin to the well-known grazing limit from the kinetic Boltzmann equation to the kinetic Landau equation. We also show the GENERIC structure of the limiting system.</description>

      <title>Effective theories for incompressible magnetoelastic shallow shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the asymptotic behaviour, in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence, of a thin magnetoelastic shallow shell. The compactness is achieved up to rigid motions. For deformations, it relies on an approximation by rigid movements, whereas for magnetizations it is based on a careful consideration of the geometry of the deformed domain. The result is obtained by a combination of variational methods ($\Gamma$-convergence) with degree theory, fixed-point and geometrical arguments. The proof strategy relies on an adaptation of an analogous result for incompressible magnetoelastic plates from M. Bresciani in arXiv:2007.14122 and an application of results by I.Velcic on elastic shallow shells in arXiv:1102.2647.</description>

      <title>On the one-dimensional piston model with Large Velocity Variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of a one-dimensional piston expanding into a static rarefied gas. Using asymptotic analysis in the limit of vanishing initial density, we derive sharp estimates for the piston-shock distance, the separation of characteristic speeds, and the reflection coefficient associated with characteristic waves interacting with the leading shock front. Based on these estimates, we apply the method of characteristics to prove the global-in-time existence of piecewise smooth solutions. The resulting flow structure exhibits significant velocity variations. The analysis reveals a stable mechanism that operates in the vanishing-density limit of the piston model.</description>

      <title>Surface Stokes Without Inf-Sup Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $d$-dimensional hypersurface of class $C^3$ without boundary, we reformulate the surface Stokes equations as a nonsymmetric indefinite elliptic problem governed by two Laplacians. We then use this elliptic reformulation as a basis for a numerical method based on lifted parametric FEM. Assuming no geometric error for simplicity, we prove its well-posedness, quasi-best approximation in a robust mesh-dependent $H^1$-norm for any polynomial degree, as well as an optimal $L^2$ error estimate for both velocity and pressure. This entails a sufficiently small mesh size that solely depends on the Weingarten map and circumvents the usual discrete inf-sup condition. We present numerical experiments for velocity-pressure pairs with equal and disparate polynomial degrees, demonstrating that the proposed method is both accurate and practical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove constant-curvature analogues of several results regarding the hot spots conjecture in dimension two. Our main theorem shows that the hot spots conjecture holds for all non-acute geodesic triangles of constant negative curvature. We also prove that, under certain circumstances, on constant (positive or negative) curvature triangles, first mixed Dirichlet-Neumann Laplace eigenfunctions have no non-vertex critical points. Moreover, we show that each of these eigenfunctions is monotonic with respect to some Killing field. Finally, we show that for general simply connected polygons of non-zero constant curvature--with exactly one family of exceptions--second Neumann eigenfunctions of the Laplacian have at most finitely many critical points.</description>

      <title>A convergence proof for a finite element discretization of Chorin's projection method of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chorin's projection method combined with a finite element spatial discretization for the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The scheme advances the solution in two steps: a prediction step, which computes an intermediate velocity field that is generally not divergence-free, and a projection step, which enforces incompressibility by projecting this velocity onto the divergence-free subspace. We establish convergence, up to a subsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a Leray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional regularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data. A discrete energy inequality yields a priori estimates, which we combine with a new compactness result to prove precompactness of the approximations in $L^2([0,T]\times\Omega)$, where $[0,T]$ is the time interval and $\Omega$ is the spatial domain. Passing to the limit as the discretization parameters vanish, we obtain a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. A central difficulty is that different a priori bounds are available for the intermediate and projected velocity fields; our compactness argument carefully integrates these estimates to complete the convergence proof.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Semantic Diffusion: A p-Laplacian Synthesis with Learnable Dissipation, Quantified Constants, and Graph-Aware Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a calibrated diffusion framework by synthesizing three established concepts: linear Laplacian smoothing, nonlinear graph p-Laplacian flows, and a learnable dissipation term derived from a strongly convex potential. This synthesis provides a general model for graph-based diffusion with controllable dynamics. Our key theoretical results include a quantified two-regime decay analysis for $p&gt;2$, which provides stronger, p-dependent transient bounds not captured by standard ISS templates, and the first formalization of a "non-synonymy" impossibility principle, which proves that fixed-parameter models cannot meet universal performance targets across graphs with varying spectral properties. To address this, we propose a constructive calibration algorithm (SGPS) with formal guarantees for achieving target rates and mass. We derive explicit, closed-form lower bounds for the graph p-gap on canonical graphs a notable improvement over prior implicit estimates and provide sharp constants for discrete-time and stochastic stability, including a contextualized restatement of the necessary and sufficient Euler step-size and a strengthened analysis of the stochastic noise floor. Illustrative, small-scale empirical validations confirm the tightness of key theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Minnaert Resonances in High-contrast acoustic Structures and Applications to Invisibility Cloaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13659v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomenon in acoustic wave propagation through high-contrast medium in both two and three dimensions, occurring in the sub-wavelength regime. These media are characterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a homogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary features: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total field and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near the boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of the fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances, which are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical parameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but with a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast material structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully designed incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances. Extensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks and spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and clovers in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the occurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that quasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the high-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for mathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking technologies.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Singularities for the Damped Stochastic Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the $1+1$ dimensional damped stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, we show that random singularities associated with the law of the iterated logarithm exist and propogate in the same way as the stochastic wave equation. This provides evidence for possible connections to microlocal analysis, ie. the exact regularity and singularities described in this paper should admit wavefront set type descriptions whose propagation is determined by the highest order terms of the linear operator. Despite the results being exactly the same as those of the wave equation, our proofs are significantly different than the proofs for the wave equation. Miraculously, proving our results for the critically damped equation implies them for the general equation, which significantly simplifies the problem. Even after this simplification, many important parts of the proof are significantly different than (and we think are more intuitive from the PDE viewpoint compared to) existing proofs for the wave equation.</description>

Abstract: In the first Heisenberg group, we study entire, locally Sobolev intrinsic graphs that are stable for the sub-Riemannian area. We show that, under appropriate integrability conditions for the derivatives, the intrinsic graph must be an intrinsic plane, i.e., a coset of a two dimensional subgroup.

Abstract: We consider a non-linear system modelling the dynamics of a linearly elastic body immersed in an incompressible viscous fluid, without damping on the elastic part. We prove local existence of strong solutions and global existence and uniqueness for small data. At the same time, depending on the geometric setting, non-trivial time-periodic solutions, called pressure waves, may persist. Our main result is the characterization of long-time behaviour of the elastic displacement: up to small rigid motions, either the system comes to rest or converges to a pressure wave.</description>

New functional settings are found, which allow to sharply understand boundary behavior issues and invertibility settings. The approach mainly exploits analogous results obtained only recently in the Euclidean disk, together with the projective equivalence between the two models.</description>

Abstract: We study a fuzzy variant of the inhomogeneous Landau equation and establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions for moderately soft potentials. The spatial delocalization introduced in the collision operator not only enhances regularity and prevents singularity formation, but also reveals additional structural properties of the model. In particular, we show that several forms of the Fisher information decay monotonically or remain uniformly bounded in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral part of boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_zv_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega={\rm curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. We use $H^3$ Sobolev estimates for the modified stream function (stream function divided by radius) and energy type estimates for gradient of swirl to derive two order reduction estimates. These help one to derive a global estimate for a regular solution. This estimate yields the existence of global regular axially-symmetric solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses two significant drawbacks of an eddy viscosity turbulence model: the issue of excessive dissipation relative to energy input and the lack of a universal parameter specification. Considering the Baldwin-Lomax model with backscatter effects, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions under mild conditions. Our next result shows that this model maintains energy dissipation rates consistent with energy input, thereby avoiding over-dissipation and aligning with K41 phenomenology. Additionally, we propose a range for the model's parameters.</description>

Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas. To be precise, starting from many-body quantum mechanics, where the problem is linear and regular but involving non commutative operators, we justify the emergence of the $\Phi^4_3$ measure as a semiclassical limit which captures the formation of Bose--Einstein condensation just above the critical temperature. We employ and develop several tools from both stochastic quantization and many-body quantum mechanics. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, our first key step involves approximating the $\Phi^4_3$ measure through a Hartree measure with nonlocal interaction, achieved by developing new techniques in paracontrolled calculus. The connection between the quantum problem and the Hartree measure emerges through a variational interplay between classical and quantum models.</description>
