      <title>On Polynomial Representations of Dual DP Color Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) is a generalization of list coloring that was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in 2015. The chromatic polynomial of a graph is an important notion in algebraic combinatorics that was introduced by Birkhoff in 1912; denoted $P(G,m)$, it equals the number of proper $m$-colorings of graph $G$. Counting function analogues of chromatic polynomials have been introduced for list colorings: $P_{\ell}$, list color functions (1990); DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, DP color functions (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$, dual DP color functions (2021). For any graph $G$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_{DP}(G, m) \leq P_\ell(G,m) \leq P(G,m) \leq P_{DP}^*(G,m)$. In 2022 (improving on older results) Dong and Zhang showed that for any graph $G$, $P_{\ell}(G,m)=P(G,m)$ whenever $m \geq |E(G)|-1$. Consequently, the list color function of a graph is a polynomial for sufficiently large $m$. One of the most important and longstanding open questions on DP color functions asks: for every graph $G$ is there an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and a polynomial $p(m)$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) = p(m)$ whenever $m \geq N$? We show that the answer to the analogue of this question for dual DP color functions is no. Our proof reveals a connection between a dual DP color function and the balanced chromatic polynomial of a signed graph introduced by Zaslavsky in 1982.</description>

      <title>Spectral supersaturation: Triangles and bowties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ning and Zhai (2023) proved that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\lambda (G) \ge \sqrt{\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor}$ has at least $\lfloor n/2\rfloor -1$ triangles, unless $G=K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Using the supersaturation-stability method, we prove a stability variant of Ning-Zhai's result by showing that such a graph $G$ contains at least $n-3$ triangles if no vertex is in all triangles of $G$. This result could also be viewed as a spectral version of a result of Xiao and Katona (2021). The second part concerns with the spectral supersaturation for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a common vertex. A theorem of Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, Gould and Gunderson (1995) says that every $n$-vertex graph with more than $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor +1$ edges contains a bowtie. For graphs of given order, the spectral supersaturation problem has not been considered for substructures that are not color-critical. In this paper, we give the first such theorem by counting the number of bowties. Let $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}$ by embedding two disjoint edges into the vertex part of size $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$. Our result shows that every graph $G$ with $n\ge 8.8 \times 10^6$ vertices and $\lambda (G)\ge \lambda (K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2})$ contains at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor}^{+2}$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This gives a spectral correspondence of a theorem of Kang, Makai and Pikhurko (2020). The method used in our paper provides a probable way to establish the spectral counting results for other graphs, even for non-color-critical graphs.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Algorithm for Minimizing $k$-Distant Submodular Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the minimization problem of relaxed submodular functions. For a positive integer $k$, a set function is called $k$-distant submodular if the submodular inequality holds for every pair whose symmetric difference is at least $k$. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to minimize $k$-distant submodular functions for a fixed positive integer $k$. This result generalizes the tractable result of minimizing 2/3-submodular functions, which satisfy the submodular inequality for at least two pairs formed from every distinct three sets.</description>

      <title>$\theta$-free matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is extensive literature on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result due to Lov\'asz and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving tool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems below, and we solve one of them.
  A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect matching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear decomposition theorem -- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart from $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\theta$, or a conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\theta$ refers to the graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to two problems: characterize $\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching covered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs was obtained by Kothari and Murty [J. Graph Theory, 82 (1), 2016]; the nonplanar case is open.
  We provide a characterization of $\theta$-free matching covered graphs that immediately implies a poly-time algorithm for the corresponding decision problem. Our characterization relies heavily on a seminal result due to Edmonds, Lov\'asz and Pulleyblank [Combinatorica, 2, 1982] pertaining to the tight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs. As corollaries, we provide two upper bounds on the size of a $\theta$-free graph, namely, $m\leq 2n-1$ and $m\leq \frac{3n}{2}+b-1$, where $b$ denotes the number of bricks obtained in any tight cut decomposition of the graph; for each bound, we provide a characterization of the tight examples. The Petersen graph and $K_4$ play key roles in our results.</description>

      <title>Macdonald polynomials at t = 0 through (generalized) multiline queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiline queues are versatile objects arising from queueing theory in probability that have come to play a key role in understanding the remarkable connection between the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a circle and Macdonald polynomials. We define an insertion procedure we call collapsing on multiline queues which can be described by raising and lowering crystal operators. Using this procedure, one naturally recovers several classical results such as the Lascoux--Sch\"utzenberger charge formulas for $q$-Whittaker polynomials, Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the dual Cauchy identity. We extend the results to generalized multiline queues by defining a statistic on these objects that allows us to derive a family of formulas, indexed by compositions, for the $q$-Whittaker polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Novel Property of Generalized Fibonacci Sequence in Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibonacci sequence, generated by summing the preceding two terms, is a classical sequence renowned for its elegant properties. In this paper, leveraging properties of generalized Fibonacci sequences and formulas for consecutive sums of equidistant subsequences, we investigate the ratio of the sum of numbers along main-diagonal and sub-diagonal of odd-order grids containing generalized Fibonacci sequences. We show that this ratio is solely dependent on the order of the grid, providing a concise and splendid identity.</description>

      <title>$IP$ rich ultrafilters and new partition regular equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $1979$, using the theory of ultrafilters, N. Hindman proved that for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exists a color that contains both additive and multiplicative $IP$ sets. Later, in $1993$, V. Bergelson and N. Hindman found an elementary proof. In this article, we prove that the partial product of these two $IP$ sets also lies in the same color. As an immediate consequence, we have the equation $a+b=c\cdot d$ partition regular. This was a conjecture of P. Csikv\'{a}ri, K. Gyarmati, and A. S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, which was solved by V. Bergelson and N. Hindman independently. In this article, we separately give a very short proof of this conjecture. Then we extend these results to the flavor of Rado systems.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of closed neighborhood corona product of graph and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of the closed neighborhood corona product of the graph. We explore the mathematical features of this product graph, specifically in terms of its spectral characteristics. We have calculated the characteristic polynomials of the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian matrices. Moreover, we investigate the conditions under which two graphs are cospectral regarding this product. A significant portion of our study is dedicated to computing the Kirchhoff index, the number of spanning trees and the sequence of non-cospectral equienergetic product graphs. We also outline specific criteria that determine when the product graph is integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the notions of self-orthogonal subspace codes and LCD subspace codes were introduced, and LCD subspace codes obtained from mutually unbiased weighing matrices were studied. In this paper, we provide a method of constructing self-orthogonal and LCD subspace codes from a set of matrices under certain conditions. In particular, we give constructions of self-orthogonal and LCD subspace codes from mutually quasi-unbiased weighing matrices, linked systems of symmetric designs, and linked systems of symmetric group divisible designs, Deza graphs and their equitable partitions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Colouring of Kneser Graphs: Notes on Stahl's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a graph is $n$-colourable, then it obviously is $n'$-colourable for any $n'\ge n$. But the situation is not so clear when we consider multi-colourings of graphs. A graph is $(n,k)$-colourable if we can assign each vertex a $k$-subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoint subsets. In this note we consider the following problem: if a graph is $(n,k)$-colourable, then for what pairs $(n', k')$ is it also $(n',k')$-colourable? This question can be translated into a question regarding multi-colourings of Kneser graphs, for which Stahl formulated a conjecture in 1976. We present new results, strengthen existing results, and in particular present much simpler proofs of several known cases of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Small families of partially shattering permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a family of permutations $t$-shatters a set if it induces at least $t$ distinct permutations on that set. What is the minimum number $f_k(n,t)$ of permutations of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ that $t$-shatter all subsets of size $k$? For $t \le 2$, $f_k(n,t) = \Theta(1)$. Spencer showed that $f_k(n,t) = \Theta(\log \log n)$ for $3 \le t \le k$ and $f_k(n,k!) = \Theta(\log n)$. In 1996, F\"uredi asked whether partial shattering with permutations must always fall into one of these three regimes. Johnson and Wickes recently settled the case $k = 3$ affirmatively and proved that $f_k(n,t) = \Theta(\log n)$ for $t &gt; 2 (k-1)!$.
  We give a surprising negative answer to the question of F\"uredi by showing that a fourth regime exists for $k \ge 4$. We establish that $f_k(n,t) = \Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ for certain values of $t$ and prove that this is the only other regime when $k = 4$. We also show that $f_k(n,t) = \Theta(\log n)$ for $t &gt; 2^{k-1}$. This greatly narrows the range of $t$ for which the asymptotic behaviour of $f_k(n,t)$ is unknown.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity for independent sets of valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several proofs of the Mason--Welsh conjecture for matroids have been found, which asserts the log-concavity of the sequence that counts independent sets of a given size. In this article we use the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, developed by Br\"and\'en and Huh, to prove a generalization of the Mason-Welsh conjecture to the context of valuated matroids. In fact, we provide a log-concavity result in the more general setting of valuated discrete polymatroids, or equivalently, M-convex functions. Our approach is via the construction of a generic extension of a valuated matroid or M-convex function, so that the bases of the extension are related to the independent sets of the original matroid. We also provide a similar log-concavity result for valuated bimatroids, which, we believe, might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perfect matching complex of a simple graph G is a simplicial complex having facets (maximal faces) as the perfect matchings of G. This article discusses the perfect matching complex of polygonal line tiling and the $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph in particular. We use tools from discrete Morse theory to show that the perfect matching complex of any polygonal line tiling is either contractible or homotopically equivalent to a wedge of spheres. While proving our results, we also characterise all the matchings that can not be extended to form a perfect matching.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs with uniform Tur\'an density equal to 8/27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os initiated the study of Tur\'an problems with a uniformity condition on the distribution of edges: the uniform Tur\'an density of a hypergraph $H$ is the infimum over all $d$ for which any sufficiently large hypergraph with the property that all its linear-size subhypergraphs have density at least $d$ contains $H$. In particular, they asked to determine the uniform Tur\'an densities of $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved in [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter still remains open. Till today, there are known constructions of 3-uniform hypergraphs with uniform Tur\'an density equal to 0, 1/27, 4/27 and 1/4 only. We extend this list by a fifth value: we prove an easy to verify condition for the uniform Tur\'an density to be equal to 8/27 and identify hypergraphs satisfying this condition.</description>

      <title>A coarse Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{induced packing} of cycles in a graph is a set of vertex-disjoint cycles with no edges between them. We generalise the classic Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa theorem to induced packings of cycles. More specifically, we show that there exists a function ${f(k) = \mathcal{O}(k \log k)}$ such that for every positive integer ${k}$, every graph $G$ contains either an induced packing of $k$ cycles or a set $X$ of at most~${f(k)}$ vertices such that the closed neighbourhood of $X$ intersects all cycles in $G$. Our proof is constructive and yields a polynomial-time algorithm finding either the induced packing of cycles or the set $X$. Furthermore, we show that for every positive integer ${d}$, if a graph $G$ does not contain two cycles at distance more than $d$, then $G$ contains sets $X_1,X_2\subseteq V(G)$ with $\lvert {X_1} \rvert \leq12(d+1)$ and $\lvert {X_2} \rvert \leq12$ such that after removing the ball of radius $2d$ around $X_1$ or the ball of radius $3d$ around $X_2$, the resulting graphs are forests.
  As a corollary, we prove that every graph with no $K_{1,t}$ induced subgraph and no induced packing of $k$ cycles has tree-independence number at most $\mathcal{O}(tk\log k)$, and one can construct a corresponding tree-decomposition in polynomial time. This resolves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard et al. (arXiv:2402.11222), and implies that on such graphs, many NP-hard problems, such as Maximum Weight Independent Set, Maximum Weight Induced Matching, Graph Homomorphism, and Minimum Weight Feedback Vertex Set, are solvable in polynomial time. On the other hand, we show that the class of all graphs with no $K_{1,3}$ induced subgraph and no two cycles at distance more than $2$ has unbounded tree-independence number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an optimal sufficient condition, relating minimum degree and bandwidth, for a graph to contain a spanning subdivision of the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,\ell}$. This includes the containment of Hamilton paths and cycles, and has applications in the random geometric graph model. Our proof provides a greedy algorithm for constructing such structures.</description>

      <title>Embedding bumpless pipedreams as Bruhat chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials are distinguished representatives of Schubert cycles in the cohomology of the flag variety. In the spirit of Bergeron and Sottile, we use the Bruhat order to give $(n-1)!$ different combinatorial formulas for the Schubert polynomial of a permutation in $S_n$. By work of Lenart and Sottile, one extreme of the formulas recover the classical Pipedream (PD) formula. We prove the other extreme corresponds to Bumpless pipedreams (BPDs). We give two applications of this perspective to view BPDs: Using the Fomin-Kirrilov algebra, we solve the problem of finding a BPD analogue of Fomin and Stanley's algebraic construction on PDs; We also establish a bijection between PDs and BPDs using Lenart's growth diagram, which conjectually agrees with the existing bijection of Gao and Huang.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs in blowups of fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in the graph obtained from a fan by blowing up each vertex by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set $X$ of $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. This result holds in the more general setting of graphs contained in the strong product of a bounded treewidth graph and a path, which includes bounded genus graphs, graphs excluding a fixed apex graph as a minor, and $k$-planar graphs for fixed $k$. These results are obtained using two ingredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\log n)/D)$ vertices whose removal results in a graph with local density at most $D$. The second is a generalization of a method of Feige and Rao, that relates bandwidth and local density using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings.</description>

      <title>An Intersection Matrix for Affine Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real affine hyperplane arrangement, we define an integer intersection matrix with a natural $q$-deformation related to the intersections of bounded chambers of the arrangement. By connecting the integer matrix to a bilinear form of Schechtman-Varchenko, we show that there is a closed formula for its determinant that only depends on the combinatorics of the underlying matroid. We conjecture an analogous formula for its $q$-deformation. Our work also applies more generally in the setting of affine oriented matroids.
  Additionally, we give a representation-theoretic interpretation of our $q$-intersection matrix using Braden-Licata-Proudfoot-Websters's hypertoric category $\mathcal{O}$ (or more generally Kowalenko-Mautner's category $\mathcal{O}$ for oriented matroid programs). This paper is part of a broader program to categorify matroidal Schur algebras defined by Braden-Mautner.</description>

      <title>Existential Closure in Uniform Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$, a graph with at least $n$ vertices is $n$-existentially closed or simply $n$-e.c. if for any set of vertices $S$ of size $n$ and any set $T\subseteq S$, there is a vertex $x\not\in S$ adjacent to each vertex of $T$ and no vertex of $S\setminus T$. We extend this concept to uniform hypergraphs, find necessary conditions for $n$-e.c. hypergraphs to exist, and prove that random uniform hypergraphs are asymptotically $n$-existentially closed. We then provide constructions to generate infinitely many examples of $n$-e.c. hypergraphs. In particular, these constructions use certain combinatorial designs as ingredients, adding to the ever-growing list of applications of designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove necessary conditions for certain elementary symmetric functions, $e_\lambda$, to appear with nonzero coefficient in Stanley's chromatic symmetric function as well as in the generalization considered by Shareshian and Wachs. We do this by first considering the expansion in the monomial or Schur basis and then performing a basis change. Using the former, we make a connection with two fundamental graph theory invariants, the independence and clique numbers. This allows us to prove nonnegativity of three-column coefficients for all natural unit interval graphs. The Schur basis permits us to give a new interpretation of the coefficient of $e_n$ in terms of tableaux. We are also able to give an explicit formula for that coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm that, given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of an $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$ in $O(m\,\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^4)$ time. For constant $\epsilon$, this is the first linear-time algorithm for this problem without any restrictions on $\Delta$ other than the necessary bound $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$. The best previous result in this direction, very recently obtained by Assadi, gives a randomized algorithm with expected running time $O(m \, \log(1/\epsilon))$ under the assumption $\Delta \gg \log n/\epsilon$; removing the lower bound on $\Delta$ was explicitly mentioned as a challenging open problem by Bhattacharya, Costa, Panski, and Solomon. Indeed, even for edge-coloring with $2\Delta - 1$ colors (i.e., meeting the "greedy" bound), no linear-time algorithm covering the full range of $\Delta$ has been known until now. Additionally, when $\epsilon = 1/\Delta$, our result yields an $O(m\,\Delta^4\log \Delta)$-time algorithm for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring, improving the bound $O(m\, \Delta^{17})$ from the authors' earlier work.</description>

      <title>Counting Permutation Patterns with Multidimensional Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the well-studied pattern counting problem: given a permutation $\pi \in \mathbb{S}_n$ and an integer $k &gt; 1$, count the number of order-isomorphic occurrences of every pattern $\tau \in \mathbb{S}_k$ in $\pi$.
  Our first result is an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$-time algorithm for $k=6$ and $k=7$. The proof relies heavily on a new family of graphs that we introduce, called pattern-trees. Every such tree corresponds to an integer linear combination of permutations in $\mathbb{S}_k$, and is associated with linear extensions of partially ordered sets. We design an evaluation algorithm for these combinations, and apply it to a family of linearly-independent trees. For $k=8$, we show a barrier: the subspace spanned by trees in the previous family has dimension exactly $|\mathbb{S}_8| - 1$, one less than required.
  Our second result is an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{7/4})$-time algorithm for $k=5$. This algorithm extends the framework of pattern-trees by speeding-up their evaluation in certain cases. A key component of the proof is the introduction of pair-rectangle-trees, a data structure for dominance counting.</description>

      <title>Clustering in typical unit-distance avoiding sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1960s Moser asked how dense a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be if no pairs of points in the subset are exactly distance 1 apart. There has been a long line of work showing upper bounds on this density. One curious feature of dense unit distance avoiding sets is that they appear to be ``clumpy,'' i.e. forbidding unit distances comes hand in hand with having more than the expected number distance $\approx 2$ pairs.
  In this work we rigorously establish this phenomenon in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that dense unit distance avoiding sets have over-represented distance $\approx 2$ pairs, and that this clustering extends to typical unit distance avoiding sets. To do so, we build off of the linear programming approach used previously to prove upper bounds on the density of unit distance avoiding sets.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a friendly introduction to chip-firing games and graph gonality. We use graphs coming from the five Platonic solids to illustrate different tools and techniques for studying these games, including independent sets, treewidth, scramble number, and Dhar's burning algorithm. In addition to showcasing some previously known results, we present the first proofs that the dodecahedron graph has gonality $6$, and that the icosahedron graph has gonality~$9$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of probability graphons, continuum representations of edge-decorated graphs arising in graph limits theory, to the 'right convergence' point of view. First of all, we generalise the notions of overlay functionals and quotient sets to the case of probability graphons. Furthermore, we characterise the convergence of probability graphons in terms of these global quantities. In particular, we show the equivalence of these two notions of convergence with the unlabelled cut-metric convergence (and thus also with the homomorphism densities convergence and the subgraph sampling convergence). In other words, we prove the equivalence of the 'left convergence' and the 'right convergence' views on probability graphons convergence, generalising the corresponding result for (real-valued) graphons (the classical continuum representation for simple graphs).</description>

Abstract: We show that each set of $n\ge 2$ points in the plane in general position has a straight-line matching with at least $(5n+1)/27$ edges whose segments form a connected set, and such a matching can be computed in $O(n \log n)$ time. As an upper bound, we show that for some planar point sets in general position the largest matching whose segments form a connected set has $\lceil \frac{n-1}{3}\rceil$ edges. We also consider a colored version, where each edge of the matching should connect points with different colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of two numbers that are associated with Lie groups. The first number is $N(G,m)$, the number of conjugacy classes of elements in $G$ whose order divides $m$. The second number is $N(G,m,s)$, the number of conjugacy classes of elements in $G$ whose order divides $m$ and which have $s$ distinct eigenvalues, where we view $G$ as a matrix group in its smallest-degree faithful representation. We describe systematic algorithms for computing both numbers for $G$ a connected and simply-connected exceptional Lie group. We also provide explicit results for all of $N(G,m)$, $N(G_2,m,s)$, and $N(F_4,m,s)$. The numbers $N(G,m,s)$ were previously known only for the classical Lie groups; our results for $N(G,m)$ agree with those already in the literature but are obtained differently.</description>

Abstract: Bidirected graphs are multigraphs where every edge has an independent direction at each end. In the paper, with an arbitrary bidirected graph we associate a non-negative integral quadratic form (called the incidence form of the graph), and determine all forms that appear in this way in two main results: first, among non-negative connected unit forms, precisely those of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ or $\mathbb{D}$ are incidence forms; second, we give simple conditions on the coefficients of a non-negative connected non-unitary form to be an incidence form. We say that those non-unitary forms have Dynkin type $\mathbb{C}$, and justify such nomenclature by generalizing known classifications and properties of non-negative quadratic forms of Dynkin types $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ to the introduced type~$\mathbb{C}$. We also show that the graphical framework of an incidence form is an useful tool to visualize its arithmetical properties, to prove new facts and to perform efficient computations for integral quadratic forms and related problems in number theory, algebra and graph theory. For instance, in a third main result we relate the walks of a bidirected graph with the $0,1,2$-roots of the associated incidence form (and to the classical root systems in the positive case). Moreover, we prove the universality property for a large class of integral quadratic forms, provide computational methods to find solutions or to characterize the finiteness of the sets of solutions of various related Diophantine equations, show a variant of Whitney's theorem on line graphs using switching classes, and apply our techniques to give a conceptual and constructive proof of the non-negativity (and possible Dynkin types) of the Euler quadratic forms of a class of finite-dimensional gentle algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ k, n \in \mathbb{N}^+ $ and $ m \in \mathbb{N}^+ \cup \{\infty \} $. A $ k $-multiset in $ [n]_m $ is a $ k $-set whose elements are integers from $ \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} $, and each element is allowed to have at most $ m $ repetitions. A family of $ k $-multisets in $ [n]_m $ is said to be intersecting if every pair of $ k $-multisets from the family have non-empty intersection. In this paper, we give the size and structure of the largest non-trivial intersecting family of $ k $-multisets in $ [n]_m $ for $ n \geq k + \lceil k/m \rceil $. In the special case when $m=\infty$, our result gives rise to an unbounded multiset version for Hilton-Milner Theorem given by Meagher and Purdy. Furthermore, our main theorem unites the statements of the Hilton-Milner Theorem for finite sets and unbounded multisets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two recent conjectures of Bourn and Erickson (2023) regarding the real-rootedness of a certain family of polynomials $N_n(t)$ as well as the sum of their coefficients. These polynomials arise as the numerators of generating functions in the context of the discrete one-dimensional earth mover's distance (EMD) and have also connection to the Wiener index of minuscule lattices. We also prove that the coefficients of $N_n(x)$ are asymptotically normal, the coefficient matrix of $N_n(x)$ is totally positive and the polynomial sequence $N_n(x)$'s is $x$-log-concave.</description>

      <title>Joint distributions of statistics over permutations avoiding two patterns of length 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding distributions of permutation statistics over pattern-avoiding classes of permutations attracted much attention in the literature. In particular, Bukata et al. found distributions of ascents and descents on permutations avoiding any two patterns of length 3. In this paper, we generalize these results in two different ways: we find explicit formulas for the joint distribution of six statistics (asc, des, lrmax, lrmin, rlmax, rlmin), and also explicit formulas for the joint distribution of four statistics (asc, des, MNA, MND) on these permutations in all cases. The latter result also extends the recent studies by Kitaev and Zhang of the statistics MNA and MND (related to non-overlapping occurrences of ascents and descents) on stack-sortable permutations. All multivariate generating functions in our paper are rational, and we provide combinatorial proofs of five equidistribution results that can be derived from the generating functions.</description>

Abstract: The chromatic number related to a colouring of facets of certain classes of generalised associahedra is studied. The exact values are obtained for permutohedra, associahedra and simple permutoassociahedra, while lower and upper bounds are established for cyclohedra and stellohedra.

      <description>arXiv:2312.15326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly dividing a divisible heterogeneous resource, also known as a cake, among a set of agents who may have different entitlements. We characterize the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation -- one in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines its existence using O(n * 2^n) queries. We devise a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations and with equal entitlements, and present an algorithm to determine the existence of such an allocation using O(n^2) queries. We provide matching lower bounds in the number of queries for both algorithms. When a connected strongly-proportional allocation exists, we show that it can also be computed using a similar number of queries. We also consider the problem of deciding the existence of a connected allocation of a cake in which each agent receives a piece worth a small fixed value more than their proportional share, and the problem of deciding the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation of a pie.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of ${\bf x}$. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{reflection complexity} function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software {\tt Walnut} to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue--Morse sequence. We prove a Morse--Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and Rote sequences. There are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,q\}^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon proved that for any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lceil\frac n2\rceil$ vertices of $H(n,2)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$. In this note, we prove that for any $q\geq 3$ and any sequence $v_1,\ldots,v_b$ of $b=\lfloor(1-\frac1q)n\rfloor$ vertices of $H(n,q)$, there is a vertex whose distance from $v_i$ is at least $b-i+1$ for all $1\leq i\leq b$.
  Alon used the Beck--Spencer Lemma which, in turn, was based on the floating variable method introduced by Beck and Fiala who studied combinatorial discrepancies. For our proof, we extend the Beck--Spencer Lemma by using a multicolor version of the floating variable method due to Doerr and Srivastav.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree II: Overview and Open Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively (from the root) split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of the model is an active research topic, and this article provides an extensive overview what is currently known. For many results there are different proofs, probabilistic or analytic, so the model provides a testbed for a ``compare and contrast" discussion of techniques. We give some proofs that are not currently available elsewhere, and also give heuristics for some proven results and for some open problems. Our discussion is centered around three ``foundational" results.
  (i) There is a canonical embedding into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree $\mbox{CTCS}(n)$ on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. The family $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction of $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure $\mbox{CTCS}(\infty)$ formalized via exchangeable partitions, in some ways analogous to the Brownian continuum random tree.
  (ii) There is a CLT for leaf heights, and the analytic proof can be extended to provide surprisingly precise analysis of other height-related aspects.
  (iii) There is an explicit description of the limit {\em fringe distribution} relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies.
  Many open problems remain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New presentations of Specht modules of symmetric groups over fields of characteristic zero have been obtained by Brauner, Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs. These involve generators that are column tabloids and relations that are Garnir relations with maximal number of exchanges between consecutive columns or symmetrization of Garnir relations with minimal number of exchanges between consecutive columns. In this paper, we examine Garnir relations and their symmetrization with any number of exchanges. In both cases, we provide sufficient arithmetic conditions so that the corresponding quotient is a Specht module. In particular, in the first case this yields new presentations of Specht modules if the parts of the conjugate partition that correspond to maximal number of exchanges greater than 1 are distinct. These results generalize the presentations mentioned above and offer an answer to a question of Friedmann, Hanlon and Wachs. Our approach is via representations of the general linear group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Self-Supervised training strategy specifically designed for combinatorial problems. One of the main obstacles in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the requirement of expensive target solutions as ground-truth, often produced with costly exact solvers. Inspired by Semi- and Self-Supervised learning, we show that it is possible to easily train generative models by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, completely removing the need for optimality information. We prove the effectiveness of this Self-Labeling strategy on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the Reinforcement Learning community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with our strategy. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and current state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; this is known to be false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>
