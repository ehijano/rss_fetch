      <title>Decomposition Dilemmas: Does Claim Decomposition Boost or Burden Fact-Checking Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fact-checking pipelines increasingly adopt the Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm, where texts are broken down into smaller claims for individual verification and subsequently combined for a veracity decision. While decomposition is widely-adopted in such pipelines, its effects on final fact-checking performance remain underexplored. Some studies have reported improvements from decompostition, while others have observed performance declines, indicating its inconsistent impact. To date, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted to understand this variability. To address this gap, we present an in-depth analysis that explicitly examines the impact of decomposition on downstream verification performance. Through error case inspection and experiments, we introduce a categorization of decomposition errors and reveal a trade-off between accuracy gains and the noise introduced through decomposition. Our analysis provides new insights into understanding current system's instability and offers guidance for future studies toward improving claim decomposition in fact-checking pipelines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retrieval Performance: An Ensemble Approach For Hard Negative Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking consistently emerges as a primary focus in information retrieval research. Retrieval and ranking models serve as the foundation for numerous applications, including web search, open domain QA, enterprise domain QA, and text-based recommender systems. Typically, these models undergo training on triplets consisting of binary relevance assignments, comprising one positive and one negative passage. However, their utilization involves a context where a significantly more nuanced understanding of relevance is necessary, especially when re-ranking a large pool of potentially relevant passages. Although collecting positive examples through user feedback like impressions or clicks is straightforward, identifying suitable negative pairs from a vast pool of possibly millions or even billions of documents possess a greater challenge. Generating a substantial number of negative pairs is often necessary to maintain the high quality of the model. Several approaches have been suggested in literature to tackle the issue of selecting suitable negative pairs from an extensive corpus. This study focuses on explaining the crucial role of hard negatives in the training process of cross-encoder models, specifically aiming to explain the performance gains observed with hard negative sampling compared to random sampling. We have developed a robust hard negative mining technique for efficient training of cross-encoder re-rank models on an enterprise dataset which has domain specific context. We provide a novel perspective to enhance retrieval models, ultimately influencing the performance of advanced LLM systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reasoning and Action Agents (ReAct). The proposed approach demonstrates that learning both similarity and dissimilarity simultaneously with cross-encoders improves performance of retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>JPEC: A Novel Graph Neural Network for Competitor Retrieval in Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have gained popularity for their ability to organize and analyze complex data effectively. When combined with graph embedding techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), knowledge graphs become a potent tool in providing valuable insights. This study explores the application of graph embedding in identifying competitors from a financial knowledge graph. Existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) models face challenges due to the unique attributes of our knowledge graph, including directed and undirected relationships, attributed nodes, and minimal annotated competitor connections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph embedding model, JPEC(JPMorgan Proximity Embedding for Competitor Detection), which utilizes graph neural network to learn from both first-order and second-order node proximity together with vital features for competitor retrieval. JPEC had outperformed most existing models in extensive experiments, showcasing its effectiveness in competitor retrieval.</description>

      <title>JEL: Applying End-to-End Neural Entity Linking in JPMorgan Chase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing key relationship among the entities of interest to enterprises and for integrating data from heterogeneous sources. JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) is leading this trend by leveraging knowledge graphs across the organization for multiple mission critical applications such as risk assessment, fraud detection, investment advice, etc. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph is to link mentions (e.g., company names) that are encountered in textual sources to entities in the knowledge graph. Although several techniques exist for entity linking, they are tuned for entities that exist in Wikipedia, and fail to generalize for the entities that are of interest to an enterprise. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural entity linking model (JEL) that uses minimal context information and a margin loss to generate entity embeddings, and a Wide &amp; Deep Learning model to match character and semantic information respectively. We show that JEL achieves the state-of-the-art performance to link mentions of company names in financial news with entities in our knowledge graph. We report on our efforts to deploy this model in the company-wide system to generate alerts in response to financial news. The methodology used for JEL is directly applicable and usable by other enterprises who need entity linking solutions for data that are unique to their respective situations.</description>

      <title>Memory Augmented Cross-encoders for Controllable Personalized Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized search represents a problem where retrieval models condition on historical user interaction data in order to improve retrieval results. However, personalization is commonly perceived as opaque and not amenable to control by users. Further, personalization necessarily limits the space of items that users are exposed to. Therefore, prior work notes a tension between personalization and users' ability for discovering novel items. While discovery of novel items in personalization setups may be resolved through search result diversification, these approaches do little to allow user control over personalization. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an approach for controllable personalized search. Our model, CtrlCE presents a novel cross-encoder model augmented with an editable memory constructed from users historical items. Our proposed memory augmentation allows cross-encoder models to condition on large amounts of historical user data and supports interaction from users permitting control over personalization. Further, controllable personalization for search must account for queries which don't require personalization, and in turn user control. For this, we introduce a calibrated mixing model which determines when personalization is necessary. This allows system designers using CtrlCE to only obtain user input for control when necessary. In multiple datasets of personalized search, we show CtrlCE to result in effective personalization as well as fulfill various key goals for controllable personalized search.</description>

      <title>HtmlRAG: HTML is Better Than Plain Text for Modeling Retrieved Knowledge in RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been shown to improve knowledge capabilities and alleviate the hallucination problem of LLMs. The Web is a major source of external knowledge used in RAG systems, and many commercial systems such as ChatGPT and Perplexity have used Web search engines as their major retrieval systems. Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and pruning strategies, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Specifically, we design a two-step block-tree-based pruning method that prunes useless HTML blocks and keeps only the relevant part of the HTML. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multimodal Foundation Models in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have revolutionized sequential recommender systems through advanced representation learning. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Hierarchical Representation for Medication Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medication recommender is to suggest appropriate medication combinations based on a patient's health history, e.g., diagnoses and procedures. Existing works represent different diagnoses/procedures well separated by one-hot encodings. However, they ignore the latent hierarchical structures of these medical terms, undermining the generalization performance of the model. For example, "Respiratory Diseases", "Chronic Respiratory Diseases" and "Chronic Bronchiti" have a hierarchical relationship, progressing from general to specific. To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical encoder named HIER to hierarchically represent diagnoses and procedures, which is based on standard medical codes and compatible with any existing methods. Specifically, the proposed method learns relation embedding with a self-supervised objective for incorporating the neighbor hierarchical structure. Additionally, we develop the position encoding to explicitly introduce global hierarchical position. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant and consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy across four baselines and two real-world clinical datasets.</description>

      <title>INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed to challenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research. Our dataset and code are available at https://inquire-benchmark.github.io</description>

      <title>MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, where retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but underperforms a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to modality bias from MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose to continually fine-tune the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while maintaining multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on MTEB retrieval benchmark. Finally, we explore to prompt the off-the-shelf MLLMs as the zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way to advance universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-Aware Adaptation in Extended Reality: A Design Space for XR Interfaces and an Adaptive Placement Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By converting the entire 3D space around the user into a screen, Extended Reality (XR) can ameliorate traditional displays' space limitations and facilitate the consumption of multiple pieces of information at a time. However, if designed inappropriately, these XR interfaces can overwhelm the user and complicate information access. In this work, we explored the design dimensions that can be adapted to enable suitable presentation and interaction within an XR interface. To investigate a specific use case of context-aware adaptations within our proposed design space, we concentrated on the spatial layout of the XR content and investigated non-adaptive and adaptive placement strategies. In this paper, we (1) present a comprehensive design space for XR interfaces, (2) propose Environment-referenced, an adaptive placement strategy that uses a relevant intermediary from the environment within a Hybrid Frame of Reference (FoR) for each XR object, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of this adaptive placement strategy and a non-adaptive Body-Fixed placement strategy in four contextual scenarios varying in terms of social setting and user mobility in the environment. The performance of these placement strategies from our within-subjects user study emphasized the importance of intermediaries' relevance to the user's focus. These findings underscore the importance of context-aware interfaces, indicating that the appropriate use of an adaptive content placement strategy in a context can significantly improve task efficiency, accuracy, and usability.</description>

      <title>Language Models and Cycle Consistency for Self-Reflective Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT). We start with one conjecture: an ideal translation should contain complete and accurate information for a strong enough LLM to recover the original sentence. We generate multiple translation candidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently translate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the cycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using metrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the translation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth. This also helps to evaluate the LLM translation capability, only with monolingual corpora. For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with optimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our experiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward passes during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the LLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law. This work provide methods for, 1) to implicitly evaluate translation quality of a sentence in the target language, 2), to evaluate capability of LLM for any-to-any-language translation, and 3), how to generate a better translation for a specific LLM.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Manufacturing Feature Recognition in CAD Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic feature recognition (AFR) is essential for transforming design knowledge into actionable manufacturing information. Traditional AFR methods, which rely on predefined geometric rules and large datasets, are often time-consuming and lack generalizability across various manufacturing features. To address these challenges, this study investigates vision-language models (VLMs) for automating the recognition of a wide range of manufacturing features in CAD designs without the need for extensive training datasets or predefined rules. Instead, prompt engineering techniques, such as multi-view query images, few-shot learning, sequential reasoning, and chain-of-thought, are applied to enable recognition. The approach is evaluated on a newly developed CAD dataset containing designs of varying complexity relevant to machining, additive manufacturing, sheet metal forming, molding, and casting. Five VLMs, including three closed-source models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Claude-3.0-Opus) and two open-source models (LLava and MiniCPM), are evaluated on this dataset with ground truth features labelled by experts. Key metrics include feature quantity accuracy, feature name matching accuracy, hallucination rate, and mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the highest feature quantity accuracy (74%) and name-matching accuracy (75%) with the lowest MAE (3.2), while GPT-4o records the lowest hallucination rate (8%). In contrast, open-source models have higher hallucination rates (&gt;30%) and lower accuracies (&lt;40%). This study demonstrates the potential of VLMs to automate feature recognition in CAD designs within diverse manufacturing scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research community has traditionally shown a keen interest in emotion modeling, with a notable emphasis on the detection aspect. In contrast, the exploration of emotion generation has received less attention.This study delves into an existing state-of-the-art emotional chatbot, EmoBot, designed for generating emotions in general-purpose conversations. This research involves a comprehensive examination, including a survey to evaluate EmoBot's proficiency in key dimensions like usability, accuracy, and overall user satisfaction, with a specific focus on fault tolerance. By closely examining the chatbot's operations, we identified some noteworthy shortcomings in the existing model. We propose some solutions designed to address and overcome the identified issues.</description>

      <title>WASHtsApp -- A RAG-powered WhatsApp Chatbot for supporting rural African clean water access, sanitation and hygiene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WASHtsApp, a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to educate rural African communities on clean water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) principles. WASHtsApp leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to address the limitations of previous approaches with limited reach or missing contextualization. The paper details the development process, employing Design Science Research Methodology. The evaluation consisted of two phases: content validation by four WASH experts and community validation by potential users. Content validation confirmed WASHtsApp's ability to provide accurate and relevant WASH-related information. Community validation indicated high user acceptance and perceived usefulness of the chatbot. The paper concludes by discussing the potential for further development, including incorporating local languages and user data analysis for targeted interventions. It also proposes future research cycles focused on wider deployment and leveraging user data for educational purposes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Unify Audio, Visual and Text for Audio-Enhanced Multilingual Visual Answer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of Multilingual Visual Answer Localization (MVAL) is to locate a video segment that answers a given multilingual question. Existing methods either focus solely on visual modality or integrate visual and subtitle modalities. However, these methods neglect the audio modality in videos, consequently leading to incomplete input information and poor performance in the MVAL task. In this paper, we propose a unified Audio-Visual-Textual Span Localization (AVTSL) method that incorporates audio modality to augment both visual and textual representations for the MVAL task. Specifically, we integrate features from three modalities and develop three predictors, each tailored to the unique contributions of the fused modalities: an audio-visual predictor, a visual predictor, and a textual predictor. Each predictor generates predictions based on its respective modality. To maintain consistency across the predicted results, we introduce an Audio-Visual-Textual Consistency module. This module utilizes a Dynamic Triangular Loss (DTL) function, allowing each modality's predictor to dynamically learn from the others. This collaborative learning ensures that the model generates consistent and comprehensive answers. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the audio modality.</description>

      <title>Graph-DPEP: Decomposed Plug and Ensemble Play for Few-Shot Document Relation Extraction with Graph-of-Thoughts Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on massive corpora have demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capability on many NLP tasks. Recasting an NLP task into a text-to-text generation task is a common practice so that generative LLMs can be prompted to resolve it. However, performing document-level relation extraction (DocRE) tasks with generative LLM models is still challenging due to the structured output format of DocRE, which complicates the conversion to plain text. Limited information available in few-shot samples and prompt instructions induce further difficulties and challenges in relation extraction for mentioned entities in a document. In this paper, we represent the structured output as a graph-style triplet rather than natural language expressions and leverage generative LLMs for the DocRE task. Our approach, the Graph-DPEP framework is grounded in the reasoning behind triplet explanation thoughts presented in natural language. In this framework, we first introduce a ``decomposed-plug" method for performing the generation from LLMs over prompts with type-space decomposition to alleviate the burden of distinguishing all relation types. Second, we employ a verifier for calibrating the generation and identifying overlooked query entity pairs. Third, we develop "ensemble-play", reapplying generation on the entire type list by leveraging the reasoning thoughts embedded in a sub-graph associated with the missing query pair to address the missingness issue. Through extensive comparisons with existing prompt techniques and alternative Language Models (LLMs), our framework demonstrates superior performance on publicly available benchmarks in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the extensive recommender systems literature, novelty and diversity have been identified as key properties of useful recommendations. However, these properties have received limited attention in the specific sub-field of research paper recommender systems. In this work, we argue for the importance of offering novel and diverse research paper recommendations to scientists. This approach aims to reduce siloed reading, break down filter bubbles, and promote interdisciplinary research. We propose a novel framework for evaluating the novelty and diversity of research paper recommendations that leverages methods from network analysis and natural language processing. Using this framework, we show that the choice of representational method within a larger research paper recommendation system can have a measurable impact on the nature of downstream recommendations, specifically on their novelty and diversity. We highlight a novel paper embedding method, which we demonstrate offers more innovative and diverse recommendations without sacrificing precision, compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>DSFNet: Learning Disentangled Scenario Factorization for Multi-Scenario Route Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scenario route ranking (MSRR) is crucial in many industrial mapping systems. However, the industrial community mainly adopts interactive interfaces to encourage users to select pre-defined scenarios, which may hinder the downstream ranking performance. In addition, in the academic community, the multi-scenario ranking works only come from other fields, and there are no works specifically focusing on route data due to lacking a publicly available MSRR dataset. Moreover, all the existing multi-scenario works still fail to address the three specific challenges of MSRR simultaneously, i.e. explosion of scenario number, high entanglement, and high-capacity demand. Different from the prior, to address MSRR, our key idea is to factorize the complicated scenario in route ranking into several disentangled factor scenario patterns. Accordingly, we propose a novel method, Disentangled Scenario Factorization Network (DSFNet), which flexibly composes scenario-dependent parameters based on a high-capacity multi-factor-scenario-branch structure. Then, a novel regularization is proposed to induce the disentanglement of factor scenarios. Furthermore, two extra novel techniques, i.e. scenario-aware batch normalization and scenario-aware feature filtering, are developed to improve the network awareness of scenario representation. Additionally, to facilitate MSRR research in the academic community, we propose MSDR, the first large-scale publicly available annotated industrial Multi-Scenario Driving Route dataset. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our DSFNet, which has been successfully deployed in AMap to serve the major online traffic.</description>

      <title>Decoding Matters: Addressing Amplification Bias and Homogeneity Issue for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation requires careful consideration of the decoding process, given the inherent differences between generating items and natural language. Existing approaches often directly apply LLMs' original decoding methods. However, we find these methods encounter significant challenges: 1) amplification bias -- where standard length normalization inflates scores for items containing tokens with generation probabilities close to 1 (termed ghost tokens), and 2) homogeneity issue -- generating multiple similar or repetitive items for a user. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new decoding approach named Debiasing-Diversifying Decoding (D3). D3 disables length normalization for ghost tokens to alleviate amplification bias, and it incorporates a text-free assistant model to encourage tokens less frequently generated by LLMs for counteracting recommendation homogeneity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing accuracy and diversity. The code is available at https://github.com/SAI990323/DecodingMatters.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</description>

      <title>Green Recommender Systems: Optimizing Dataset Size for Energy-Efficient Algorithm Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As recommender systems become increasingly prevalent, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of training large-scale models have come under scrutiny. This paper investigates the potential for energy-efficient algorithm performance by optimizing dataset sizes through downsampling techniques in the context of Green Recommender Systems. We conducted experiments on the MovieLens 100K, 1M, 10M, and Amazon Toys and Games datasets, analyzing the performance of various recommender algorithms under different portions of dataset size. Our results indicate that while more training data generally leads to higher algorithm performance, certain algorithms, such as FunkSVD and BiasedMF, particularly with unbalanced and sparse datasets like Amazon Toys and Games, maintain high-quality recommendations with up to a 50% reduction in training data, achieving nDCG@10 scores within approximately 13% of full dataset performance. These findings suggest that strategic dataset reduction can decrease computational and environmental costs without substantially compromising recommendation quality. This study advances sustainable and green recommender systems by providing insights for reducing energy consumption while maintaining effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained wide attention as the key component to improve generative models with external knowledge augmentation from information retrieval. It has shown great prominence in enhancing the functionality and performance of large language model (LLM)-based applications. However, with the comprehensive application of RAG, more and more problems and limitations have been identified, thus urgently requiring further fundamental exploration to improve current RAG frameworks. This workshop aims to explore in depth how to conduct refined and reliable RAG for downstream AI tasks.
  To this end, we propose to organize the first R3AG workshop at SIGIR-AP 2024 to call for participants to re-examine and formulate the basic principles and practical implementation of refined and reliable RAG. The workshop serves as a platform for both academia and industry researchers to conduct discussions, share insights, and foster research to build the next generation of RAG systems. Participants will engage in discussions and presentations focusing on fundamental challenges, cutting-edge research, and potential pathways to improve RAG. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding of how to improve the reliability and applicability of RAG with more robust information retrieval and language generation.</description>

      <title>Pearl: Personalizing Large Language Model Writing Assistants with Generation-Calibrated Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful large language models have facilitated the development of writing assistants that promise to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of composition and communication. However, a barrier to effective assistance is the lack of personalization in LLM outputs to the author's communication style, specialized knowledge, and values. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing Pearl, a LLM writing assistant personalized with a retriever that is trained to be generation-calibrated for personalization. Generation calibration ensures that our retriever selects historic user authored documents to augment an LLM prompt such that they are likely to help an LLM generation better adhere to a users' preferences. We propose two key novelties for training such a retriever: (1) A training data selection method that identifies user requests likely to benefit from personalization and documents that provide that benefit; and (2) A scale-calibrating KL-divergence objective that ensures that our retriever scores remain proportional to the downstream generation quality from using the document for personalized generation. In a series of holistic evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Pearl in generating long-form texts on multiple social media datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how a generation-calibrated retriever can double as a performance predictor -- detecting low quality retrieval, and improving potentially under-performing outputs via revision with LLMs.</description>

      <title>PaCE: Parsimonious Concept Engineering for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used for a wide variety of tasks. While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable outputs via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE), a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Then, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activations as linear combinations of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activations, we reorient the behavior of the LLM towards the alignment goal. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Music Foundation Model as Generic Booster for Music Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of using intermediate representations from a single foundation model to enhance various music downstream tasks. We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</description>
