      <title>6-Functor Formalisms and Smooth Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is threefold: Firstly, we propose some enhancements to the existing definition of 6-functor formalisms. Secondly, we systematically study the category of kernels, which is a certain 2-category attached to every 6-functor formalism. It provides powerful new insights into the internal structure of the 6-functor formalism and allows to abstractly define important finiteness conditions, recovering well-known examples from the literature. Finally, we apply our methods to the theory of smooth representations of $p$-adic Lie groups and, as an application, construct a canonical anti-involution on derived Hecke algebras generalizing results of Schneider--Sorensen. In an appendix we provide the necessary background on $\infty$-categories, higher algebra, enriched $\infty$-categories and $(\infty,2)$-categories. Among others we prove several new results on adjunctions in an $(\infty,2)$-category and in particular show that passing to the adjoint morphism is a functorial operation.</description>

      <title>A Topos-Theoretic Semantics of Intuitionistic Modal Logic with an Application to the Logic of Branching Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alexandrov topology affords a well-known semantics of modal necessity and possibility. This paper develops an Alexandrov topological semantics of intuitionistic propositional modal logic internally in any elementary topos. This is done by constructing interior and closure operators on the power-object associated to a given relation in the ambient topos. When the relation is an order, these operators model intuitionistic S4; when the relation is an equivalence relation, they also model the characteristic (B) axiom of classical S5. The running example of interest arises from the Branching space-time of Nuel Belnap, which is shown to induce a histories presheaf upon which can be defined an equivalence relation of being obviously undivided at a given point event. These results have some philosophical implications. For example, we study the branching space-time example in light of the indistinguishability interpretation of epistemic modal logic. We will also study several famous first-order formulas in presheaf topos semantics such as the so-called Barcan formula. We shall see, however, that one of the Barcan converses is invalidated by a simple example of non-trivial space-time branching. This invalidates a thesis of metaphysical actualism, namely, that there are no possibly existing but non-actual entities.</description>

      <title>Relative monadicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a relative monadicity theorem for relative monads with dense roots in a virtual equipment, specialising to a relative monadicity theorem for enriched relative monads. In particular, for a dense $\mathbb V$-functor $j \colon A \to E$, a $\mathbb V$-functor $r \colon D \to E$ is $j$-monadic if and only if $r$ admits a left $j$-relative adjoint and creates $j$-absolute colimits. This provides a refinement of the classical monadicity theorem -- characterising those categories whose objects are given by those of $E$ equipped with algebraic structure -- in which the arities of the algebraic operations are valued in $A$. In particular, when $j = 1$, we recover a formal monadicity theorem. Furthermore, we examine the interaction between the pasting law for relative adjunctions and relative monadicity. As a consequence, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the ($j$-relative) monadicity of the composite of a $\mathbb V$-functor with a ($j$-relatively) monadic $\mathbb V$-functor.</description>

      <title>The nerve theorem for relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental result in the theory of monads is the characterisation of the category of algebras for a monad in terms of a pullback of the category of presheaves on the category of free algebras: intuitively, this expresses that every algebra is a colimit of free algebras. We establish an analogous result for enriched relative monads with dense roots, and explain how it generalises the nerve theorems for monads with arities and nervous monads. As an application, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of algebraic colimits of relative monads. More generally, we establish such a characterisation of the category of algebras in the context of an exact virtual equipment. In doing so, we are led to study the relationship between a $j$-relative monad $T$ and its associated loose-monad $E(j, T)$, and consequently show that the opalgebra object and the algebra object for $T$ may be constructed from certain double categorical limits and colimits associated to $E(j, T)$.</description>

      <title>Decomposition spaces in Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.09225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decomposition space (also called 2-Segal space) is a simplicial object satisfying an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition: just as the Segal condition expresses composition, the new condition expresses decomposition. It is a general framework for incidence (co)algebras. In this contribution, after establishing a formula for the section coefficients, we survey a large supply of examples, emphasising the notion's firm roots in classical combinatorics. The first batch of examples, similar to binomial posets, serves to illustrate 2 key points: (1) the incidence algebra in question is realised directly from a decomposition space, without a reduction step, and reductions are often given by CULF functors; (2) at the objective level, the convolution algebra is a monoidal structure of species. We encounter the usual Cauchy product of species, the shuffle product of L-species, the Dirichlet product of arithmetic species, the Joyal-Street external product of q-species and the Morrison `Cauchy' product of q-species. In each case a power series representation results from taking cardinality. The external product of q-species exemplifies the fact that Waldhausen's S-construction on an abelian category is a decomposition space, yielding Hall algebras. The next class of examples includes Schmitt's chromatic Hopf algebra, the Fa\`a di Bruno bialgebra, the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees and variations from operad theory. Similar structures on posets and directed graphs exemplify a general construction of decomposition spaces from directed restriction species. An appetiser on decomposition spaces of symmetric functions is included. We finish by computing the M\"obius function in a few cases, and commenting on certain cancellations that occur in the process of taking cardinality, substantiating that these cancellations are not possible at the objective level.</description>
