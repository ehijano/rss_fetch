      <title>A Finite-State Symbolic Automaton Model for the Collatz Map and Its Convergence Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-state, deterministic automaton that emulates the Collatz function by operating on base-10 digit sequences. Each digit is represented as a symbolic triplet capturing its value, the parity of the next digit, and a local carry value, resulting in a state space of exactly 60 configurations. The transition rules are local, total, and parity-dependent, yet collectively reproduce the global behavior of the Collatz map through digitwise operations. All symbolic trajectories reduce to the unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -&gt; (2, 0, 0) -&gt; (1, 0, 0), offering a constructive, automaton-theoretic encoding of the Collatz dynamics. A primitive recursive ranking function ensures symbolic termination within the proposed model and supports a convergence argument that is fully formalizable in Peano Arithmetic. This approach introduces a novel framework for analyzing arithmetic dynamics via symbolic computation and automata theory.</description>

      <title>Shape Preserving Tree Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that shape preservation is decidable for top-down tree transducers, bottom-up tree transducers, and for compositions of total deterministic macro tree transducers. Moreover, if a transducer is shape preserving, then it can be brought into a particular normal form, where every input node creates exactly one output node.</description>

      <title>Bridging Chaos Game Representations and $k$-mer Frequencies of DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22172v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes formal mathematical foundations linking Chaos Game Representations (CGR) of DNA sequences to their underlying $k$-mer frequencies. We prove that the Frequency CGR (FCGR) of order $k$ is mathematically equivalent to a discretization of CGR at resolution $2^k \times 2^k$, and its vectorization corresponds to the $k$-mer frequencies of the sequence. Additionally, we characterize how symmetry transformations of CGR images correspond to specific nucleotide permutations in the originating sequences. Leveraging these insights, we introduce an algorithm that generates synthetic DNA sequences from prescribed $k$-mer distributions by constructing Eulerian paths on De Bruijn multigraphs. This enables reconstruction of sequences matching target $k$-mer profiles with arbitrarily high precision, facilitating the creation of synthetic CGR images for applications such as data augmentation for machine learning-based taxonomic classification of DNA sequences. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our method across both real genomic data and artificially sampled distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive framework that unifies CGR geometry, $k$-mer statistics, and sequence reconstruction, offering new tools for genomic analysis and visualization.</description>

      <title>Negated String Containment is Decidable (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a positive answer to a long-standing open question of the decidability of the not-contains string predicate. Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate notContains(x1 ... xn, y1 ... ym), where x1 ... xn and y1 ... ym are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</description>

      <title>Nets-within-Nets through the Lens of Data Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a model in the nets-within-nets (NWNs) paradigm, where tokens in turn can host standard Petri nets. We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\mathbf{F}_{\omega 2}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega^\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.</description>

      <title>QuAK: Quantitative Automata Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: System behaviors are traditionally evaluated through binary classifications of correctness, which do not suffice for properties involving quantitative aspects of systems and executions. Quantitative automata offer a more nuanced approach, mapping each execution to a real number by incorporating weighted transitions and value functions generalizing acceptance conditions. In this paper, we introduce QuAK, the first tool designed to automate the analysis of quantitative automata. QuAK currently supports a variety of quantitative automaton types, including Inf, Sup, LimInf, LimSup, LimInfAvg, and LimSupAvg automata, and implements decision procedures for problems such as emptiness, universality, inclusion, equivalence, as well as for checking whether an automaton is safe, live, or constant. Additionally, QuAK is able to compute extremal values when possible, construct safety-liveness decompositions, and monitor system behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QuAK through experiments focusing on the inclusion, constant-function check, and monitoring problems.</description>
