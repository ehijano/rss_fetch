      <title>A Surprisingly Simple Method for Distributed Euclidean-Minimum Spanning Tree / Single Linkage Dendrogram Construction from High Dimensional Embeddings via Distance Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a decomposition method for the distributed calculation of exact Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees in high dimensions (where sub-quadratic algorithms are not effective), or more generalized geometric-minimum spanning trees of complete graphs, where for each vertex $v\in V$ in the graph $G=(V,E)$ is represented by a vector in $\vec{v}\in \mathbb{R}^n$, and each for any edge, the the weight of the edge in the graph is given by a symmetric binary `distance' function between the representative vectors $w(\{x,y\}) = d(\vec{x},\vec{y})$. This is motivated by the task of clustering high dimensional embeddings produced by neural networks, where low-dimensional algorithms are ineffective; such geometric-minimum spanning trees find applications as a subroutine in the construction of single linkage dendrograms, as the two structures can be converted between each other efficiently.</description>

      <title>On the number of digons in arrangements of pairwise intersecting circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing open conjecture of Branko Gr\"unbaum from 1972 states that any simple arrangement of $n$ pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in the plane can have at most $2n-2$ digons. Agarwal et al. proved this conjecture for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in which there is a common point surrounded by all pseudocircles. Recently, Felsner, Roch and Scheucher showed that Gr\"unbaum's conjecture is true for arrangements of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles in which there are three pseudocircles every pair of which create a digon. In this paper we prove this over 50-year-old conjecture of Gr\"unbaum for any simple arrangement of pairwise intersecting circles in the plane.</description>

      <title>Node-Level Topological Representation Learning on Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) allows us to extract powerful topological and higher-order information on the global shape of a data set or point cloud. Tools like Persistent Homology or the Euler Transform give a single complex description of the global structure of the point cloud. However, common machine learning applications like classification require point-level information and features to be available. In this paper, we bridge this gap and propose a novel method to extract node-level topological features from complex point clouds using discrete variants of concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry. We verify the effectiveness of these topological point features (TOPF) on both synthetic and real-world data and study their robustness under noise.</description>

      <title>Recognition of Unit Segment and Polyline Graphs is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of objects O in the plane, the corresponding intersection graph is defined as follows. A vertex is created for each object and an edge joins two vertices whenever the corresponding objects intersect. We study here the case of unit segments and polylines with exactly k bends. In the recognition problem, we are given a graph and want to decide whether the graph can be represented as the intersection graph of certain geometric objects. In previous work it was shown that various recognition problems are $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete, leaving unit segments and polylines as few remaining natural cases. We show that recognition for both families of objects is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</description>
