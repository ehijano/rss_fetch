      <title>Spectral localizers in KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the index homomorphism of even K-groups arising from a class in even KK-theory via the Kasparov product. Due to the seminal work of Baaj and Julg, under mild conditions on the C^*-algebras in question such a class in KK-theory can always be represented by an unbounded Kasparov module. We then describe the corresponding index homomorphism of even K-groups in terms of spectral localizers. This means that our explicit formula for the index homomorphism does not depend on the full spectrum of the abstract Dirac operator D, but rather on the intersection between this spectrum and a compact interval. The size of this compact interval does however reflect the interplay between the K-theoretic input and the abstract Dirac operator. Since the spectral projections for D are not available in the general context of Hilbert $C^*$-modules we instead rely on certain continuous compactly supported functions applied to D to construct the spectral localizer. In the special case where even KK-theory coincides with even K-homology, our work recovers the pioneering work of Loring and Schulz-Baldes on the index pairing.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Witt theory of derived schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a non-$\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant motivic ring spectrum $\mathrm{KO}$ over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, whose associated cohomology theory on qcqs derived schemes is the Grothendieck-Witt theory of classical symmetric forms (as opposed to homotopy symmetric forms). In particular, we show that this theory satisfies Nisnevich descent, smooth blowup excision, a projective bundle formula, and is locally left Kan extended from smooth $\mathbb{Z}$-schemes up to Bass delooping. More generally, our construction produces $\mathrm{KO}$-modules representing localizing invariants of two different families of Poincar\'e structures on derived schemes, which we call "classical" and "genuine"; the latter Poincar\'e structures are defined for spectral schemes with involution, but the former only for derived schemes.
  We then establish basic properties of these motivic spectra. As in $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory, the fracture square of $\mathrm{KO}$ with respect to the Hopf element recovers the fundamental cartesian square relating GW-theory, L-theory, and K-theory. A new phenomenon when $2$ is not a unit is that $\mathrm{KO}$ is not Bott-periodic, and the left and right Bott periodizations of $\mathrm{KO}$ represent the Grothendieck-Witt theories of homotopy symmetric and homotopy quadratic forms, respectively. We also construct the expected metalinear $\mathrm{E}_\infty$-orientation of $\mathrm{KO}$. Finally, we show that the $\mathbb{A}^1$-localization of $\mathrm{KO}$ recovers the motivic spectrum recently constructed by Calm\`es, Harpaz, and Nardin.</description>
