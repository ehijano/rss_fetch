      <title>Explain What You Mean: Intent Augmented Knowledge Graph Recommender Built With LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems. Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</description>

      <title>Who You Are Matters: Bridging Topics and Social Roles via LLM-Enhanced Logical Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems filter contents/items valuable to users by inferring preferences from user features and historical behaviors. Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public datasets as verification.</description>

      <title>From Intent Discovery to Recognition with Topic Modeling and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and recognizing customer intents in AI systems is crucial, particularly in domains characterized by short utterances and the cold start problem, where recommender systems must include new products or services without sufficient real user data. Customer utterances are characterized by infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity. Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem, we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings. Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition. We present a comprehensive and robust framework for online discovery and recognition of new customer intents in dynamic domains.</description>

      <title>mmRAG: A Modular Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Text, Tables, and Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, existing RAG evaluation predominantly focuses on text retrieval and relies on opaque, end-to-end assessments of generated outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce mmRAG, a modular benchmark designed for evaluating multi-modal RAG systems. Our benchmark integrates queries from six diverse question-answering datasets spanning text, tables, and knowledge graphs, which we uniformly convert into retrievable documents. To enable direct, granular evaluation of individual RAG components -- such as the accuracy of retrieval and query routing -- beyond end-to-end generation quality, we follow standard information retrieval procedures to annotate document relevance and derive dataset relevance. We establish baseline performance by evaluating a wide range of RAG implementations on mmRAG.</description>

      <title>User-centric Music Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a user-centric recommendation framework, designed as a pipeline with four distinct, connected, and customizable phases. These phases are intended to improve explainability and boost user engagement.
  We have collected the historical Last.fm track playback records of a single user over approximately 15 years. The collected dataset includes more than 90,000 playbacks and approximately 14,000 unique tracks.
  From track playback records, we have created a dataset of user temporal contexts (each row is a specific moment when the user listened to certain music descriptors). As music descriptors, we have used community-contributed Last.fm tags and Spotify audio features. They represent the music that, throughout years, the user has been listening to.
  Next, given the most relevant Last.fm tags of a moment (e.g. the hour of the day), we predict the Spotify audio features that best fit the user preferences in that particular moment. Finally, we use the predicted audio features to find tracks similar to these features. The final aim is to recommend (and discover) tracks that the user may feel like listening to at a particular moment.
  For our initial study case, we have chosen to predict only a single audio feature target: danceability. The framework, however, allows to include more target variables.
  The ability to learn the musical habits from a single user can be quite powerful, and this framework could be extended to other users.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Weight Decay in Collaborative Filtering: A Popularity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) enables large-scale recommendation systems by encoding information from historical user-item interactions into dense ID-embedding tables. However, as embedding tables grow, closed-form solutions become impractical, often necessitating the use of mini-batch gradient descent for training. Despite extensive work on designing loss functions to train CF models, we argue that one core component of these pipelines is heavily overlooked: weight decay. Attaining high-performing models typically requires careful tuning of weight decay, regardless of loss, yet its necessity is not well understood. In this work, we question why weight decay is crucial in CF pipelines and how it impacts training. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to encode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors. Moreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to influence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these findings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for embedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the training of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity information typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity. Our experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces training times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies. Additionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength, offering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias.</description>

      <title>The Future is Sparse: Embedding Compression for Scalable Retrieval in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry-scale recommender systems face a core challenge: representing entities with high cardinality, such as users or items, using dense embeddings that must be accessible during both training and inference. However, as embedding sizes grow, memory constraints make storage and access increasingly difficult. We describe a lightweight, learnable embedding compression technique that projects dense embeddings into a high-dimensional, sparsely activated space. Designed for retrieval tasks, our method reduces memory requirements while preserving retrieval performance, enabling scalable deployment under strict resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that leveraging sparsity is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of large-scale recommenders. We release our code at https://github.com/recombee/CompresSAE.</description>

      <title>CRISP: Clustering Multi-Vector Representations for Denoising and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-vector models, such as ColBERT, are a significant advancement in neural information retrieval (IR), delivering state-of-the-art performance by representing queries and documents by multiple contextualized token-level embeddings. However, this increased representation size introduces considerable storage and computational overheads which have hindered widespread adoption in practice. A common approach to mitigate this overhead is to cluster the model's frozen vectors, but this strategy's effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic clusterability of these embeddings. In this work, we introduce CRISP (Clustered Representations with Intrinsic Structure Pruning), a novel multi-vector training method which learns inherently clusterable representations directly within the end-to-end training process. By integrating clustering into the training phase rather than imposing it post-hoc, CRISP significantly outperforms post-hoc clustering at all representation sizes, as well as other token pruning methods. On the BEIR retrieval benchmarks, CRISP achieves a significant rate of ~3x reduction in the number of vectors while outperforming the original unpruned model. This indicates that learned clustering effectively denoises the model by filtering irrelevant information, thereby generating more robust multi-vector representations. With more aggressive clustering, CRISP achieves an 11x reduction in the number of vectors with only a $3.6\%$ quality loss.</description>

      <title>SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of online disinformation presents a global challenge, and machine learning has been widely explored as a potential solution. However, multilingual settings and low-resource languages are often neglected in this field. To address this gap, we conducted a shared task on multilingual claim retrieval at SemEval 2025, aimed at identifying fact-checked claims that match newly encountered claims expressed in social media posts across different languages. The task includes two subtracks: (1) a monolingual track, where social posts and claims are in the same language, and (2) a crosslingual track, where social posts and claims might be in different languages. A total of 179 participants registered for the task contributing to 52 test submissions. 23 out of 31 teams have submitted their system papers. In this paper, we report the best-performing systems as well as the most common and the most effective approaches across both subtracks. This shared task, along with its dataset and participating systems, provides valuable insights into multilingual claim retrieval and automated fact-checking, supporting future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Improve Rule Retrieval and Reasoning with Self-Induction and Relevance ReEstimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically addresses the challenges of rule retrieval, a crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Semantic Caching of Contextual Summaries for Efficient Question-Answering with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across edge and cloud platforms for real-time question-answering and retrieval-augmented generation. However, processing lengthy contexts in distributed systems incurs high computational overhead, memory usage, and network bandwidth. This paper introduces a novel semantic caching approach for storing and reusing intermediate contextual summaries, enabling efficient information reuse across similar queries in LLM-based QA workflows. Our method reduces redundant computations by up to 50-60% while maintaining answer accuracy comparable to full document processing, as demonstrated on NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, and a synthetic ArXiv dataset. This approach balances computational cost and response quality, critical for real-time AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Retrievable Domain-Sensitive Feature Memory for Multi-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increase in the business scale and number of domains in online advertising, multi-domain ad recommendation has become a mainstream solution in the industry. The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains. Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions. This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions. We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling. Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions. To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set. Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Item-Language Model for Conversational Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-language Models (LLMs) have been extremely successful at tasks like complex dialogue understanding, reasoning and coding due to their emergent abilities. These emergent abilities have been extended with multi-modality to include image, audio, and video capabilities. Recommender systems, on the other hand, have been critical for information seeking and item discovery needs. Recently, there have been attempts to apply LLMs for recommendations. One difficulty of current attempts is that the underlying LLM is usually not trained on the recommender system data, which largely contains user interaction signals and is often not publicly available. Another difficulty is user interaction signals often have a different pattern from natural language text, and it is currently unclear if the LLM training setup can learn more non-trivial knowledge from interaction signals compared with traditional recommender system methods. Finally, it is difficult to train multiple LLMs for different use-cases, and to retain the original language and reasoning abilities when learning from recommender system data. To address these three limitations, we propose an Item-Language Model (ILM), which is composed of an item encoder to produce text-aligned item representations that encode user interaction signals, and a frozen LLM that can understand those item representations with preserved pretrained knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate both the importance of the language-alignment and of user interaction knowledge in the item encoder.</description>

      <title>Flexible Generation of Preference Data for Recommendation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating a recommendation system in a controlled environment, to identify specific behaviors and user preferences, requires highly flexible synthetic data generation models capable of mimicking the patterns and trends of real datasets. In this context, we propose HYDRA, a novel preferences data generation model driven by three main factors: user-item interaction level, item popularity, and user engagement level. The key innovations of the proposed process include the ability to generate user communities characterized by similar item adoptions, reflecting real-world social influences and trends. Additionally, HYDRA considers item popularity and user engagement as mixtures of different probability distributions, allowing for a more realistic simulation of diverse scenarios. This approach enhances the model's capacity to simulate a wide range of real-world cases, capturing the complexity and variability found in actual user behavior.

      <title>DiSCo: LLM Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sparse Retrieval in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational Search (CS) involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus while considering the conversational context, integrating retrieval with context modeling. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational context. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from human-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling task. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task from the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse Conversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context modeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying exclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores between conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the representation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document relevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five CS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain in recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using multiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the individual teachers in in-domain settings. Furthermore, analysis of model sparsity reveals that DiSCo allows for more effective control over the sparsity of the trained models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Recommender Models and the Illusion of Progress: A Concerning Study of Reproducibility and a Conceptual Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Countless new machine learning models are published every year and are reported to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in \emph{top-n} recommendation. However, earlier reproducibility studies indicate that progress in this area may be quite limited. Specifically, various widespread methodological issues, e.g., comparisons with untuned baseline models, have led to an \emph{illusion of progress}. In this work, our goal is to examine whether these problems persist in today's research. To this end, we aim to reproduce the latest advancements reported from applying modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to recommender systems, focusing on four models published at the top-ranked SIGIR conference in 2023 and 2024. Our findings are concerning, revealing persistent methodological problems. Alarmingly, through experiments, we find that the latest recommendation techniques based on diffusion models, despite their computational complexity and substantial carbon footprint, are consistently outperformed by simpler existing models. Furthermore, we identify key mismatches between the characteristics of diffusion models and those of the traditional \emph{top-n} recommendation task, raising doubts about their suitability for recommendation. We also note that, in the papers we analyze, the generative capabilities of these models are constrained to a minimum. Overall, our results and continued methodological issues call for greater scientific rigor and a disruptive change in the research and publication culture in this area.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Model-Based Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</description>

      <title>iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.</description>
