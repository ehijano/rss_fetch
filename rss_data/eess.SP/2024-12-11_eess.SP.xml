      <title>Joint Beamforming for STAR-RIS in Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication framework is proposed. A weighted sum rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the base station (BS) and the transmission/reflection-coefficients (TRCs) at the STAR-RIS is formulated. The resulting non-convex problem is solved by the developed block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. Numerical results illustrate that the near-field beamforming for the STAR-RIS aided MIMO communications significantly improve the achieved weighted sum rate.</description>

      <title>Beyond Idle Channels: Unlocking Idle Space with Signal Alignment in Massive MIMO Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have traditionally focused on utilizing idle channels to enhance spectrum efficiency. However, as wireless networks grow denser, channel-centric strategies face increasing limitations. This paper introduces a paradigm shift by exploring the underutilized potential of idle spatial dimensions, termed idle space, in co-channel transmissions. By integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with signal alignment techniques, we enable secondary users to transmit without causing interference to primary users by aligning their signals within the null spaces of primary receivers. We propose a comprehensive framework that synergizes spatial spectrum sensing, signal alignment, and resource allocation, specifically designed for secondary users in CRNs. Theoretical analyses and extensive simulations validate the framework, demonstrating substantial gains in spectrum efficiency, throughput, and interference mitigation. The results show that the proposed approach not only ensures interference-free coexistence with primary users but also unlocks untapped spatial resources for secondary transmissions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Routing and Link Configuration for Covert Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodes in contemporary radio networks often have multiple interfaces available for communication: WiFi, cellular, LoRa, Zigbee, etc. This motivates understanding both link and network configuration when multiple communication modalities with vastly different capabilities are available to each node. In conjunction, covertness or the hiding of radio communications is often a significant concern in both commercial and military wireless networks. We consider the optimal routing problem in wireless networks when nodes have multiple interfaces available and intend to hide the presence of the transmission from attentive and capable adversaries. We first consider the maximization of the route capacity given an end-to-end covertness constraint against a single adversary and we find a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal route selection and link configuration. We further provide optimal polynomial-time algorithms for two important extensions: (i) statistical uncertainty during optimization about the channel state information for channels from system nodes to the adversary; and, (ii) maintaining covertness against multiple adversaries. Numerical results are included to demonstrate the gains of employing heterogeneous radio resources and to compare the performance of the proposed approach versus alternatives.</description>

      <title>Channel Spreading Function-Inspired Channel Transfer Function Estimation for OFDM Systems with High-Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel channel transfer function (CTF) estimation approach for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in high-mobility scenarios, that leverages the stationary properties of the delay-Doppler domain channel spreading function (CSF). First, we develop a CSF estimation model for OFDM systems that relies solely on discrete pilot symbols in the time-frequency (TF) domain, positioned at predefined resource elements. We then present theorems to elucidate the relationship between CSF compactness and pilot spacing in the TF domain for accurate CSF acquisition. Based on the estimated CSF, we finally estimate the CTF for data symbols. Numerical results show that, in high-mobility scenarios, the proposed approach outperforms traditional interpolation-based methods and closely matches the optimal estimator in terms of estimation accuracy. This work may pave the way for CSF estimation in commercial OFDM systems, benefiting high-mobility communications, integrated sensing and communications, and related applications.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications for Digital Signals via Carrier Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of current semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks focus on the image transmission, which, however, do not address the problem on how to deliver digital signals without any semantic features. This paper proposes a novel SemCom approach to transmit digital signals by using the image as the carrier signal. Specifically, the proposed approach encodes the digital signal as a binary stream and maps it to mask locations on an image. This allows binary data to be visually represented, enabling the use of existing model, pre-trained Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are optimized for masked image reconstruction, as the SemCom encoder and decoder. Since MAE can both process and recover masked images, this approach allows for the joint transmission of digital signals and images without additional overhead. In addition, considering the mask tokens transmission encoded by the MAE still faces extra costs, we design a sparse encoding module at the transmitter to encode the mask tokens into a sparse matrix, and it can be recovered at the receiver. Thus, this approach simply needs to transmit the latent representations of the unmasked patches and a sparse matrix, which further reduce the transmission overhead compared with the original MAE encoder. Simulation results show that the approach maintains reliable transmission of digital signals and images even in a high mask ratio of transmitted images.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Assisted Beamforming Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel research direction where a digital twin is leveraged to assist the beamforming design for an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. In this setup, a base station designs joint communication and sensing beamforming to serve the communication user and detect the sensing target concurrently. Utilizing the electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment and ray tracing, the digital twin can provide various information, e.g., propagation path parameters and wireless channels, to aid communication and sensing systems. More specifically, our digital twin-based beamforming design first leverages the environment EM 3D model and ray tracing to (i) predict the directions of the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) sensing channel paths and (ii) identify the dominant one among these sensing channel paths. Then, to optimize the joint sensing and communication beam, we maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the dominant sensing channel component while satisfying a minimum communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement. Simulation results show that the proposed digital twin-assisted beamforming design achieves near-optimal target sensing SNR in both LoS and NLoS dominant areas, while ensuring the required SINR for the communication user. This highlights the potential of leveraging digital twins to assist ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Integration Based Estimator: Robust Design and Stone Soup Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with state estimation of nonlinear stochastic dynamic models. In particular, the stochastic integration rule, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of the moments of nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variables, is reviewed together with the recently introduced stochastic integration filter (SIF). Using SIF, the respective multi-step prediction and smoothing algorithms are developed in full and efficient square-root form. The stochastic-integration-rule-based algorithms are implemented in Python (within the Stone Soup framework) and in MATLAB and are numerically evaluated and compared with the well-known unscented and extended Kalman filters using the Stone Soup defined tracking scenario.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Differentiation in Grid-Based Continuous State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the state estimation of stochastic models with continuous dynamics. The aim is to incorporate spectral differentiation methods into the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation in grid-based state estimation routine, while taking into account the specifics of the field, such as probability density function (PDF) features, moving grid, zero boundary conditions, etc. The spectral methods, in general, achieve very fast convergence rate of O(c^N )(O &lt; c &lt; 1) for analytical functions such as the probability density function, where N is the number of grid points. This is significantly better than the standard finite difference method (or midpoint rule used in discrete estimation) typically used in grid-based filter design with convergence rate O( 1 / N^2 ). As consequence, the proposed spectral method based filter provides better state estimation accuracy with lower number of grid points, and thus, with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Detection with Uncertainty in Target Direction for Dual Functional Radar and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual functional radar and communication (DFRC) systems are a viable approach to extend the services of future communication systems. Most studies designing DFRC systems assume that the target direction is known. In our paper, we address a critical scenario where this information is not exactly known. For such a system, a signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) maximization problem is formulated. Quality-of-service constraints for communication users (CUs) are also incorporated as constraints on their received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs). To tackle the nonconvexity, an iterative alternating optimization approach is developed where, at each iteration, the optimization is alternatively performed with respect to transmit and receive beamformers. Specifically, a penalty-based approach is used to obtain an efficient sub-optimal solution for the resulting subproblem with regard to transmit beamformers. Next, a globally optimal solution is obtained for receive beamformers with the help of the Dinkleback approach. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is also proved by proving the nondecreasing nature of the objective function with iterations. The numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, it is observed that the proposed algorithm converges within almost 3 iterations, and the SCNR performance is almost unchanged with the number of possible target directions.</description>

      <title>Rate Optimization for RIS-Aided mMTC Networks in the Finite Blocklength Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have become a promising candidate for the development of future mobile systems. In the context of massive machine-type communications (mMTC), a RIS can be used to support the transmission from a group of sensors to a collector node. Due to the short data packets, we focus on the design of the RIS for maximizing the weighted sum and minimum rates in the finite blocklength regime. Under the assumption of non-orthogonal multiple access, successive interference cancelation is considered as a decoding scheme to mitigate interference. Accordingly, we formulate the optimizations as non-convex problems and propose two sub-optimal solutions based on gradient ascent (GA) and sequential optimization (SO) with semi-definite relaxation (SDR). In the GA, we distinguish between Euclidean and Riemannian gradients. For the SO, we derive a concave lower bound for the throughput and maximize it sequentially applying SDR. Numerical results show that the SO can outperform the GA and that strategies relying on the optimization of the classical Shannon capacity might be inadequate for mMTC networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust RF Fingerprint Identification Using Spectral Regrowth and Carrier Frequency Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a promising device authentication approach by exploiting the unique hardware impairments as device identifiers. Because the hardware features are extracted from the received waveform, they are twisted with the channel propagation effect. Hence, channel elimination is critical for a robust RFFI system. In this paper, we designed a channel-robust RFFI scheme for IEEE 802.11 devices based on spectral regrowth and proposed a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-assisted collaborative identification mechanism. In particular, the spectral regrowth was utilized as a channel-resilient RFF representation which is rooted in the power amplifier nonlinearity. While CFO is time-varying and cannot be used alone as a reliable feature, we used CFO as an auxiliary feature to adjust the deep learning-based inference. Finally, a collaborative identification was adopted to leverage the diversity in a multi-antenna receiver. Extensive experimental evaluations were performed in practical environments using 10 IEEE 802.11 devices and a universal software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 receiver with 4 antennas. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method against diverse channel conditions and CFO drift, where an average classification accuracy of 92.76% was achieved against channel variations and a 5-month time span, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>New Characteristics and Modeling of 6G Channels: A Unified Channel Model towards Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G research advances, the growing demand leads to the emergence of novel technologies such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), new antenna arrays like Extremely Large MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), along with multi-frequency bands (6-24 GHz, above 100 GHz). Standardized unified channel models are crucial for research and performance evaluation across generations of mobile communication, but the existing 5G 3GPP channel model based on geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) requires further extension to accommodate these 6G technologies. In response to this need, this article first investigates six distinctive channel characteristics introduced by 6G techenologies, such as ISAC target RCS, sparsity in the new mid-band, and others. Subsequently, an extended GBSM (E-GBSM) is proposed, integrating these characteristics into a unified modeling framework. The proposed model not only accommodates 6G technologies with flexibility but also maintains backward compatibility with 5G, ensuring a smooth evolution between generations. Finally, the implementation process of the proposed model is detailed, with experiments and simulations validate its effectiveness and accuracy, providing support for 6G channel modeling standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>Cascaded channel modeling and experimental validation for RIS assisted communication system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is considered as a promising technology for 6G due to its ability to actively modify the electromagnetic propagation environment. Accurate channel modeling is essential for the design and evaluation of RIS assisted communication systems. Most current research models the RIS channel as a cascade of Tx-RIS and RIS-Rx sub-channels. However, most validation efforts regarding this assumption focus on large-scale path loss. To further explore this, in this paper, we derive and extend a convolution expression of RIS cascaded channel model based on the previously proposed Geometry-based Stochastic Model (GBSM)-based RIS cascaded channels. This model follows the 3GPP standard framework and leverages parameters such as angles, delays, and path powers defined in the GBSM model to more accurately reflect the smallscale characteristics of RIS multipath cascades. To verify the accuracy of this model, we conduct measurements of the TxRIS-Rx channel, Tx-RIS, and RIS-Rx sub-channels in a factory environment at 6.9 GHz, using the measured data to demonstrate the models validity and applicability in real-world scenarios. Validation with measured data shows that the proposed model accurately describes the characteristics of the RIS cascaded channel in terms of delay, angle, and power in complex multipath environments, providing important references for the design and deployment of RIS systems.</description>

      <title>Personalized Head-Related Transfer Function Prediction Based on Spatial Grouping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The head-related transfer function (HRTF) characterizes the frequency response of the sound traveling path between a specific location and the ear. When it comes to estimating HRTFs by neural network models, angle-specific models greatly outperform global models but demand high computational resources. To balance the computational resource and performance, we propose a method by grouping HRTF data spatially to reduce variance within each subspace. HRTF predicting neural network is then trained for each subspace. Simulation results show the proposed method performs better than global models and angle-specific models by using different grouping strategies at the ipsilateral and contralateral sides.</description>

      <title>Multiplant Nonlinear System Identification by Block-Structured Multikernel Neural Networks in Applications of Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problems of linear system identification have closed-form solutions, e.g., using least-squares or maximum-likelihood methods on input-output data. However, already the seemingly simplest problems of nonlinear system identification present more difficulties related to the optimisation of the furrowed error surface. Those cases include the Hammerstein plant with typically a bilinear model representation based on polynomial or Fourier expansion of its nonlinear element. Wiener plants induce actual nonlinearity in the parameters, which further complicates the optimisation. Neural network models and related optimisers are, however, well-prepared to represent and solve nonlinear problems. Unfortunately, the available data for nonlinear system identification might be too diverse to support accurate and consistent model representation. This diversity may refer to different impulse responses and nonlinear functions that arise in different measurements of (different) plants. We therefore propose multikernel neural network models to represent nonlinear plants with a subset of trainable weights shared between different measurements and another subset of plant-specific (i.e., multikernel) weights to adhere to the characteristics of specific measurements. We demonstrate that in this way we can fit neural network models to the diverse data which cannot be done with some standard methods of nonlinear system identification. For model testing, the subset of shared weights of the entire trained model is reused to support the identification and representation of unseen plant measurements, while the plant-specific model weights are readjusted to specifically meet the test data.</description>

      <title>When UAV Meets Federated Learning: Latency Minimization via Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal solution for training machine learning models over wireless networks, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation resources. Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Hankel Approach and Cram\'er-Rao Bound Analysis for Quantitative Acoustic Microscopy Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative acoustic microscopy (QAM) is a cutting-edge imaging modality that leverages very high-frequency ultrasound to characterize the acoustic and mechanical properties of biological tissues at microscopic resolutions. Radio-frequency echo signals are digitized and processed to yield two-dimensional maps. This paper introduces a weighted Hankel-based spectral method with a reweighting strategy to enhance robustness with regard to noise and reduce unreliable acoustic parameter estimates. Additionally, we derive, for the first time in QAM, Cram\'er-Rao bounds to establish theoretical performance benchmarks for acoustic parameter estimation. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperform standard autoregressive approach, particularly under challenging conditions. These advancements promise to improve the accuracy and reliability of tissue characterization, enhancing the potential of QAM for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>MIMO Beampattern Synthesis using Adaptive Frequency Modulated Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a method that synthesizes narrowband Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) beampatterns using the Multi-Tone Sinusoidal Frequency Modulated (MTSFM) waveform model. MIMO arrays transmit unique waveforms on each of their elements which increases the degrees of freedom available to synthesize novel transmit beampatterns. The MIMO beampattern shape is determined by the structure of the MIMO correlation matrix whose entries are the inner products between the waveforms transmitted on each element. The MTSFM waveform possesses an instantaneous phase that is represented as a finite Fourier series. The Fourier coefficients are modified to synthesize sets of waveforms whose correlation matrix realizes a desired MIMO transmit beampattern. The MIMO correlation matrix for a MTSFM waveform set has an analytical form expressed in terms of Generalized Bessel Functions. These mathematical properties are utilized to develop an optimization routine that synthesizes MTSFM waveform sets to approximate a desired MIMO transmit beampattern. The performance of this optimization routine is then demonstrated via an illustrative design example.</description>

      <title>GSM: A GNN-based Space-MIMO Framework for Direct-to-Cell Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based space multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) framework, named GSM, for direct-to-cell communications, aiming to achieve distributed coordinated beamforming for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Firstly, a system model for LEO multi-satellite communications is established, where multiple LEO satellites collaborate to perform distributed beamforming and communicate with terrestrial user terminals coherently. Based on the system model, a weighted sum rate maximization problem is formulated. Secondly, a GNN-based method is developed to address the optimization problem. Particularly, the adopted neural network is composed of multiple identical GNNs, which are trained together and then deployed individually on each LEO satellite. Finally, the trained GNN is quantized and deployed on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to accelerate the inference by customizing the microarchitecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GNN scheme outperforms the benchmark ones including maximum ratio transmission, zero forcing and minimum mean square error. Furthermore, experimental results show that the FPGA-based accelerator achieves remarkably low inference latency, ranging from 3.863 to 5.883 ms under a 10-ns target clock period with 8-bit fixed-point data representation.</description>

      <title>Sequential In-Network Processing for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Capacity-Constrained Parallel Radio Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure coherent signal processing across distributed Access Points (APs) in Cell-Free Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (CF-mMIMO) systems, a fronthaul connection between the APs and a Central Processor (CP) is imperative. We consider a fronthaul network employing parallel radio stripes. In this system, APs are grouped into multiple segments where APs within each segment are sequentially connected through a radio stripe. This fronthaul topology strikes a balance between standard star and bus topologies, which deploy parallel or serial connections of all APs. Our focus lies in designing the uplink signal processing for a CF-mMIMO system with parallel radio stripes. We tackle the challenge of finite-capacity fronthaul links by addressing the design of In-Network Processing (INP) strategies at APs. These strategies involve linearly combining received signals and compressing the combining output for fronthaul transmission, aiming to maximize the sum-rate performance. Given the high complexity and the stringent requirement for global Channel State Information (CSI) in jointly optimizing INP strategies across all APs, we propose an efficient sequential design approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed sequential INP design achieves a sum-rate gain of up to 82.92% compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a software-defined testbed for Wi-Fi channel-state information (CSI) acquisition. This testbed features distributed software-defined radios (SDRs) and a custom IEEE 802.11a software stack that enables the passive collection of CSI data from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices that connect to an existing Wi-Fi network. Unlike commodity Wi-Fi sniffers or channel sounders, our software-defined testbed enables a quick exploration of advanced CSI estimation algorithms in real-world scenarios from naturally-generated Wi-Fi traffic. We explore the effectiveness of two advanced algorithms that denoise CSI estimates, and we demonstrate that CSI-based positioning of COTS Wi-Fi devices with a multilayer perceptron is feasible in an indoor office/lab space in which people are moving.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Environmental Sensing Based Path Loss Prediction for V2I Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability and reliability of wireless data transmission in vehicular networks face significant challenges due to the high dynamics of path loss caused by the complexity of rapidly changing environments. This paper proposes a multi-modal environmental sensing-based path loss prediction architecture (MES-PLA) for V2I communications. First, we establish a multi-modal environment data and channel joint acquisition platform to generate a spatio-temporally synchronized and aligned dataset of environmental and channel data. Then we designed a multi-modal feature extraction and fusion network (MFEF-Net) for multi-modal environmental sensing data. MFEF-Net extracts features from RGB images, point cloud data, and GPS information, and integrates them with an attention mechanism to effectively leverage the strengths of each modality. The simulation results demonstrate that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of MES-PLA is 2.20 dB, indicating a notable improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-modal sensing data input. Moreover, MES-PLA exhibits enhanced stability under varying illumination conditions compared to single-modal methods.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Swift Allocation Strategies for Radio Stripe Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of an access point (AP) selection scheme to improve the total uplink (UL) spectral efficiency (SE) of a radio stripe (RS) network. This scheme optimizes the allocation matrix between the total number of APs' antennas and users' equipment (UEs) while considering two state-of-the-art and two newly proposed equalization approaches: centralized maximum ratio combining (CMRC), centralized optimal sequence linear processing (COSLP), sequential MRC (SMRC), and parallel MRC (PMRC). The optimization problem is solved through a low-complexity and adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) which aims to output an efficient solution for the AP-UE association matrix. We evaluate the proposed schemes in several network scenarios in terms of SE performance, convergence speed, computational complexity, and fronthaul signalling capacity requirements. The COSLP exhibits the best SE performance at the expense of high computational complexity and fronthaul signalling. The SMRC and PMRC are efficient solutions alternatives to the CMRC, improving its computational complexity and convergence speed. Additionally, we assess the adaptability of the MRC schemes for two different instances of network change: when a new randomly located UE must connect to the RS network and when a random UE is removed from it. We have found that in some cases, by reusing the allocation matrix from the original instance as an initial solution, the SMRC and/or the PMRC can significantly boost the optimization performance of the GA-based AP selection scheme.</description>

      <title>Explainable machine learning for neoplasms diagnosis via electrocardiograms: an externally validated study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Neoplasms remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with timely diagnosis being crucial for improving patient outcomes. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, costly, and inaccessible to many populations. Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, widely available and non-invasive, has the potential to serve as a tool for neoplasms diagnosis by using physiological changes in cardiovascular function associated with neoplastic prescences.
  Methods: This study explores the application of machine learning models to analyze ECG features for the diagnosis of neoplasms. We developed a pipeline integrating tree-based models with Shapley values for explainability. The model was trained and internally validated and externally validated on a second large-scale independent external cohort to ensure robustness and generalizability.
  Findings: The results demonstrate that ECG data can effectively capture neoplasms-associated cardiovascular changes, achieving high performance in both internal testing and external validation cohorts. Shapley values identified key ECG features influencing model predictions, revealing established and novel cardiovascular markers linked to neoplastic conditions. This non-invasive approach provides a cost-effective and scalable alternative for the diagnosis of neoplasms, particularly in resource-limited settings. Similarly, useful for the management of secondary cardiovascular effects given neoplasms therapies.
  Interpretation: This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging ECG signals and machine learning to enhance neoplasms diagnostics. By offering interpretable insights into cardio-neoplasms interactions, this approach bridges existing gaps in non-invasive diagnostics and has implications for integrating ECG-based tools into broader neoplasms diagnostic frameworks, as well as neoplasms therapy management.</description>

      <title>Mining Limited Data Sufficiently: A BERT-inspired Approach for CSI Time Series Application in Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) is the cornerstone in both wireless communication and sensing systems. In wireless communication systems, CSI provides essential insights into channel conditions, enabling system optimizations like channel compensation and dynamic resource allocation. However, the high computational complexity of CSI estimation algorithms necessitates the development of fast deep learning methods for CSI prediction. In wireless sensing systems, CSI can be leveraged to infer environmental changes, facilitating various functions, including gesture recognition and people identification. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant advantages over model-based approaches in these fine-grained CSI classification tasks, particularly when classes vary across different scenarios. However, a major challenge in training deep learning networks for wireless systems is the limited availability of data, further complicated by the diverse formats of many public datasets, which hinder integration. Additionally, collecting CSI data can be resource-intensive, requiring considerable time and manpower. To address these challenges, we propose CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, effectively utilizing limited data through a pre-training and fine-tuning approach. Building on CSI-BERT1, we enhance the model architecture by introducing an Adaptive Re-Weighting Layer (ARL) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to better capture sub-carrier and timestamp information, effectively addressing the permutation-invariance problem. Furthermore, we propose a Mask Prediction Model (MPM) fine-tuning method to improve the model's adaptability for CSI prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.</description>

      <title>QuantFormer: Learning to Quantize for Neural Activity Forecasting in Mouse Visual Cortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding complex animal behaviors hinges on deciphering the neural activity patterns within brain circuits, making the ability to forecast neural activity crucial for developing predictive models of brain dynamics. This capability holds immense value for neuroscience, particularly in applications such as real-time optogenetic interventions. While traditional encoding and decoding methods have been used to map external variables to neural activity and vice versa, they focus on interpreting past data. In contrast, neural forecasting aims to predict future neural activity, presenting a unique and challenging task due to the spatiotemporal sparsity and complex dependencies of neural signals. Existing transformer-based forecasting methods, while effective in many domains, struggle to capture the distinctiveness of neural signals characterized by spatiotemporal sparsity and intricate dependencies. To address this challenge, we here introduce QuantFormer, a transformer-based model specifically designed for forecasting neural activity from two-photon calcium imaging data. Unlike conventional regression-based approaches, QuantFormerreframes the forecasting task as a classification problem via dynamic signal quantization, enabling more effective learning of sparse neural activation patterns. Additionally, QuantFormer tackles the challenge of analyzing multivariate signals from an arbitrary number of neurons by incorporating neuron-specific tokens, allowing scalability across diverse neuronal populations. Trained with unsupervised quantization on the Allen dataset, QuantFormer sets a new benchmark in forecasting mouse visual cortex activity. It demonstrates robust performance and generalization across various stimuli and individuals, paving the way for a foundational model in neural signal prediction.</description>

      <title>DFT-s-OFDM-based On-Off Keying for Low-Power Wake-Up Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G-Advanced and likely 6G will support a new low-power wake-up signal (LP-WUS) enabling low-power devices, equipped with a complementary ultra low-power receiver to monitor wireless traffic, to completely switch off their main radio. This orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed (OFDM) signal will emulate an on-off keying (OOK) modulation to enable very low-energy envelope detection at the receiver. Higher rate LP-WUS, containing multiple OOK symbols within single OFDM symbol, will be generated using the time-domain pulse multiplexing of discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) OFDM. In this context, this paper presents a general signal design framework for DFT-s-OFDM-based OOK generation. General properties of subcarrier coefficients are derived demonstrating that only DFT of the bits needs to be computed online and repeated over the band before applying appropriate frequency-domain processing. The conventional approach of generating rectangular-like OOK waveforms is then addressed by a combination of pre-DFT bit-spreading and post-DFT processing; and the least-squares (LS) method from Mazloum and Edfors, proposed for 5G LP-WUS and also Ambient-IoT, is shown to be implementable as such. Even though aesthetically pleasing and of independent interest, rectangular-like OOK waveforms are not optimal for 5G LP-WUS scenarios due to their limited robustness to channel frequency-selectivity and timing offset, and so shaping methods for spreading the OOK spectrum and concentrating the OOK symbol energy are described and shown to improve the bit error rate performance under practical conditions.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Sparse Acoustic Array Geometries for Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09001</link>

Abstract: Angle-of-Arrival estimation technology, with its potential advantages, emerges as an intriguing choice for indoor localization. Notably, it holds the promise of reducing installation costs. In contrast to ToF/TDoA based systems, AoA-based approaches require a reduced number of nodes for effective localization. This characteristic establishes a trade-off between installation costs and the complexity of hardware and software. Moreover, the appeal of acoustic localization is further heightened by its capacity to provide cost-effective hardware solutions while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. Consequently, acoustic AoA estimation technology stands out as a feasible and compelling option in the field of indoor localization. Sparse arrays additionally have the ability to estimate the DoA of more sources than available sensors by placing sensors in a specific geometry. In this contribution, we introduce a measurement platform designed to evaluate various sparse array geometries experimentally. The acoustic microphone array comprises 64 microphones arranged in an 8x8 grid, following an Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) configuration, with a grid spacing of 8.255 mm. This configuration achieves a spatial Nyquist frequency of approximately 20.8 kHz in the acoustic domain at room temperature. Notably, the array exhibits a mean spherical error of 1.26{\deg} when excluding higher elevation angles. The platform allows for masking sensors to simulate sparse array configurations. We assess four array geometries through simulations and experimental data, identifying the Open-Box and Nested array geometries as robust candidates. Additionally, we demonstrate the array's capability to concurrently estimate the directions of three emitting sources using experimental data, employing waveforms consisting of orthogonal codes.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal MIMO Detection Using Gradient-Based MCMC in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrete nature of transmitted symbols poses challenges for achieving optimal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems associated with a large number of antennas. Recently, the combination of two powerful machine learning methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and gradient descent, has emerged as a highly efficient solution to address this issue. However, existing gradient-based MCMC detectors are heuristically designed and thus are theoretically untenable. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel sampling algorithm tailored for discrete spaces. This algorithm leverages gradients from the underlying continuous spaces for acceleration while maintaining the validity of probabilistic sampling. We prove the convergence of this method and also analyze its convergence rate using both MCMC theory and empirical diagnostics. On this basis, we develop a MIMO detector that precisely samples from the target discrete distribution and generates posterior Bayesian estimates using these samples, whose performance is thereby theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, our proposed detector is highly parallelizable and scalable to large MIMO dimensions, positioning it as a compelling candidate for next-generation wireless networks. Simulation results show that our detector achieves near-optimal performance, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and showcases resilience to various system setups.</description>

      <title>A reconfigurable calibration-free digital-to-time converter based on a high-speed transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a high-speed transceiver-based method for implementing a digital-to-time converter (DTC). A real-time decoding technique is introduced to inject time information into high-speed pattern data. The stability of the high-speed clock ensures the high precision of the synthesized timing signal without the need for calibration. The reconfigurability of the clock resources provides the DTC with variable resolution and enhanced flexibility for various applications. Based on this approach, a multifunctional DTC is designed to offer both timing sequence and random timing signal functionalities, catering to a wide range of application scenarios. The timing sequence function generates a continuously variable timing signal stream, while the random timing signal function produces random signals with uniformly distributed time intervals. Experimental results, using a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA, validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The system achieves a resolution of 100 ps, a dynamic range from 1 ns to 40 {\mu}s, a DNL of -0.02/0.02 LSB, an INL of -0.04/0.03 LSB across the entire range. This approach can be readily adapted to various high-precision timing signal applications.</description>

      <title>Noise Covariances Identification by MDM: Weighting, Recursion, and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of noise covariance matrix identification of stochastic linear time-varying state-space models is addressed. The measurement difference method (MDM) is generalized to time-varying dimensions of the measurement and control. Three MDM identification techniques that differ in weighting used in the underlying least squares method are proposed. The techniques differ in estimate quality and computational complexity. In addition, recursive forms are designed for two techniques. The performance of the proposed techniques is analyzed using two numerical examples. The implementation of techniques is enclosed with the paper.</description>

      <title>BRSR-OpGAN: Blind Radar Signal Restoration using Operational Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Many studies on radar signal restoration in the literature focus on isolated restoration problems, such as denoising over a certain type of noise, while ignoring other types of artifacts. Additionally, these approaches usually assume a noisy environment with a limited set of fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. However, real-world radar signals are often corrupted by a blend of artifacts, including but not limited to unwanted echo, sensor noise, intentional jamming, and interference, each of which can vary in type, severity, and duration. This study introduces Blind Radar Signal Restoration using an Operational Generative Adversarial Network (BRSR-OpGAN), which uses a dual domain loss in the temporal and spectral domains. This approach is designed to improve the quality of radar signals, regardless of the diversity and intensity of the corruption. Methods: The BRSR-OpGAN utilizes 1D Operational GANs, which use a generative neuron model specifically optimized for blind restoration of corrupted radar signals. This approach leverages GANs' flexibility to adapt dynamically to a wide range of artifact characteristics. Results: The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated using a well-established baseline and a newly curated extended dataset called the Blind Radar Signal Restoration (BRSR) dataset. This dataset was designed to simulate real-world conditions and includes a variety of artifacts, each varying in severity. The evaluation shows an average SNR improvement over 15.1 dB and 14.3 dB for the baseline and BRSR datasets, respectively. Finally, even on resource-constrained platforms, the proposed approach can be applied in real-time.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: A Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>
