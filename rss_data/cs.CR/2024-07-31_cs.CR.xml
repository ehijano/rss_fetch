      <title>From ML to LLM: Evaluating the Robustness of Phishing Webpage Detection Models against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing attacks attempt to deceive users into stealing sensitive information, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of numerous phishing webpage detection solutions, but these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Evaluating their robustness against adversarial phishing webpages is essential. Existing tools contain datasets of pre-designed phishing webpages for a limited number of brands, and lack diversity in phishing features.
  To address these challenges, we develop PhishOracle, a tool that generates adversarial phishing webpages by embedding diverse phishing features into legitimate webpages. We evaluate the robustness of two existing models, Stack model and Phishpedia, in classifying PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages. Additionally, we study a commercial large language model, Gemini Pro Vision, in the context of adversarial attacks. We conduct a user study to determine whether PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages deceive users. Our findings reveal that many PhishOracle-generated phishing webpages evade current phishing webpage detection models and deceive users, but Gemini Pro Vision is robust to the attack. We also develop the PhishOracle web app, allowing users to input a legitimate URL, select relevant phishing features and generate a corresponding phishing webpage. All resources are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Excavating Vulnerabilities Lurking in Multi-Factor Authentication Protocols: A Systematic Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, cyberattacks are growing exponentially, causing havoc to Internet users. In particular, authentication attacks constitute the major attack vector where intruders impersonate legitimate users to maliciously access systems or resources. Traditional single-factor authentication (SFA) protocols are often bypassed by side-channel and other attack techniques, hence they are no longer sufficient to the current authentication requirements. To alleviate this problem, multi-factor authentication (MFA) protocols have been widely adopted recently, which helps to raise the security bar against imposters. Although MFA is generally considered more robust and secure than SFA, it may not always guarantee enhanced security and efficiency. This is because, critical security vulnerabilities and performance problems may still arise due to design or implementation flaws of the protocols. Such vulnerabilities are often left unnoticed until they are exploited by attackers. Therefore, the main objective of this work is identifying such vulnerabilities in existing MFA protocols by systematically analysing their designs and constructions. To this end, we first form a set of security evaluation criteria, encompassing both existing and newly introduced ones, which we believe are very critical for the security of MFA protocols. Then, we thoroughly review several MFA protocols across different domains. Subsequently, we revisit and thoroughly analyze the design and construction of the protocols to identify potential vulnerabilities. Consequently, we manage to identify critical vulnerabilities in ten of the MFA protocols investigated. We thoroughly discuss the identified vulnerabilities in each protocol and devise relevant mitigation strategies. We also consolidate the performance information of those protocols to show the runtime and storage cost when employing varying number of authentication factors.</description>

      <title>Automated Physical Design Watermarking Leveraging Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents AutoMarks, an automated and transferable watermarking framework that leverages graph neural networks to reduce the watermark search overheads during the placement stage. AutoMarks's novel automated watermark search is accomplished by (i) constructing novel graph and node features with physical, semantic, and design constraint-aware representation; (ii) designing a data-efficient sampling strategy for watermarking fidelity label collection; and (iii) leveraging a graph neural network to learn the connectivity between cells and predict the watermarking fidelity on unseen layouts. Extensive evaluations on ISPD'15 and ISPD'19 benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed automated methodology: (i) is capable of finding quality-preserving watermarks in a short time; and (ii) is transferable across various designs, i.e., AutoMarks trained on one layout is generalizable to other benchmark circuits. AutoMarks is also resilient against potential watermark removal and forging attacks</description>

      <title>Breaking Agents: Compromising Autonomous LLM Agents Through Malfunction Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, autonomous agents built on large language models (LLMs) have experienced significant development and are being deployed in real-world applications. These agents can extend the base LLM's capabilities in multiple ways. For example, a well-built agent using GPT-3.5-Turbo as its core can outperform the more advanced GPT-4 model by leveraging external components. More importantly, the usage of tools enables these systems to perform actions in the real world, moving from merely generating text to actively interacting with their environment. Given the agents' practical applications and their ability to execute consequential actions, it is crucial to assess potential vulnerabilities. Such autonomous systems can cause more severe damage than a standalone language model if compromised. While some existing research has explored harmful actions by LLM agents, our study approaches the vulnerability from a different perspective. We introduce a new type of attack that causes malfunctions by misleading the agent into executing repetitive or irrelevant actions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using various attack methods, surfaces, and properties to pinpoint areas of susceptibility. Our experiments reveal that these attacks can induce failure rates exceeding 80\% in multiple scenarios. Through attacks on implemented and deployable agents in multi-agent scenarios, we accentuate the realistic risks associated with these vulnerabilities. To mitigate such attacks, we propose self-examination detection methods. However, our findings indicate these attacks are difficult to detect effectively using LLMs alone, highlighting the substantial risks associated with this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>On the MacWilliams Theorem over Codes and Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogies between codes and lattices have been extensively studied for the last decades, in this dictionary, the MacWilliams identity is the finite analog of the Jacobi-Poisson formula of the Theta function. Motivated by the random theory of lattices, the statistical significance of MacWilliams theorem is considered, indeed, MacWilliams distribution provides a finite analog of the classical Gauss distribution. In particular, the MacWilliams distribution over quotient space of a code is statistical close to the uniform distribution. In the respect of lattices, the analogy of MacWilliams identity associated with nu-function was conjectured by Sole in 1995. We give an answer to this problem in positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) have been proposed as an alternative solution to the scalability, throughput, and cost overhead associated with on-chain transactions. By facilitating offchain execution of transactions, PCNs significantly reduce the burden on the blockchain, leading to faster transaction processing, reduced transaction fees, and enhanced privacy. Despite these advantages, the current research in PCNs presents a variety of research challenges that require further exploration. In this paper, we survey the recent work in several aspects of PCNs, such as pathfinding and routing, virtual channels, state channels, payment channel hubs and rebalancing. This survey aims to provide the reader with a detailed understanding of the current state-of-the-art in PCN research, highlighting a few important advancements. Additionally, we highlight the various unresolved issues in the area of PCN research. Specifically, this paper seeks to answer the following crucial question: What are the various interesting and non-trivial challenges in PCN research that require immediate attention from the academic and research community? By addressing this question, we aim to identify the most pressing problems and future research directions that interested readers can immediately work on. Through this analysis, we hope to inspire researchers and practitioners to tackle these challenges to make PCNs more secure and versatile</description>

      <title>Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment: a Scalable Quantum-Safe Key Distribution Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-shared keys (PSK) have been widely used in network security. Nonetheless, existing PSK solutions are not scalable. Moreover, whenever a new user joins a network, PSK requires an existing user to get a new key before they are able to communicate with the new user. The key issue is how to distribute the PSK between different users. Here, we solve this problem by proposing a new protocol called Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE). DSKE has the advantage of being scalable. Unlike standard public key infrastructure (PKI) which relies on computational assumptions, DSKE provides information-theoretic security in a universally composable security framework. Specifically, we prove the security (correctness and confidentiality) and robustness of this protocol against a computationally unbounded adversary, who additionally may have fully compromised a bounded number of the intermediaries and can eavesdrop on all communication. DSKE also achieves distributed trust through secret sharing.
  We present several implementations of DSKE in real environments, such as providing client services to link encryptors, network encryptors, and mobile phones, as well as the implementation of intermediaries, called Security Hubs, and associated test data as evidence for its versatility. As DSKE is highly scalable in a network setting with no distance limit, it is expected to be a cost-effective quantum-safe cryptographic solution to the network security threat presented by quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Automated Code-centric Software Vulnerability Assessment: How Far Are We? An Empirical Study in C/C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17053v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The C and C++ languages hold significant importance in Software Engineering research because of their widespread use in practice. Numerous studies have utilized Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to detect software vulnerabilities (SVs) in the source code written in these languages. However, the application of these techniques in function-level SV assessment has been largely unexplored. SV assessment is increasingly crucial as it provides detailed information on the exploitability, impacts, and severity of security defects, thereby aiding in their prioritization and remediation. Aims: We conduct the first empirical study to investigate and compare the performance of ML and DL models, many of which have been used for SV detection, for function-level SV assessment in C/C++. Method: Using 9,993 vulnerable C/C++ functions, we evaluated the performance of six multi-class ML models and five multi-class DL models for the SV assessment at the function level based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). We further explore multi-task learning, which can leverage common vulnerable code to predict all SV assessment outputs simultaneously in a single model, and compare the effectiveness and efficiency of this model type with those of the original multi-class models. Results: We show that ML has matching or even better performance compared to the multi-class DL models for function-level SV assessment with significantly less training time. Employing multi-task learning allows the DL models to perform significantly better, with an average of 8-22% increase in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Conclusions: We distill the practices of using data-driven techniques for function-level SV assessment in C/C++, including the use of multi-task DL to balance efficiency and effectiveness. This can establish a strong foundation for future work in this area.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs be Fooled? Investigating Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant popularity and wielded immense power across various domains within Natural Language Processing (NLP). While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, it is crucial to identify and scrutinize their vulnerabilities especially when those vulnerabilities can have costly consequences. One such LLM, trained to provide a concise summarization from medical documents could unequivocally leak personal patient data when prompted surreptitiously. This is just one of many unfortunate examples that have been unveiled and further research is necessary to comprehend the underlying reasons behind such vulnerabilities. In this study, we delve into multiple sections of vulnerabilities which are model-based, training-time, inference-time vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies including "Model Editing" which aims at modifying LLMs behavior, and "Chroma Teaming" which incorporates synergy of multiple teaming strategies to enhance LLMs' resilience. This paper will synthesize the findings from each vulnerability section and propose new directions of research and development. By understanding the focal points of current vulnerabilities, we can better anticipate and mitigate future risks, paving the road for more robust and secure LLMs.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Image Detection: The Challenge of Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of these AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. For the task of AIGI detection, we propose a new attack containing two main parts. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous models, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as frequency-based post-train Bayesian attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario.</description>

      <title>Enabling Contextual Soft Moderation on Social Media through Contrastive Textual Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated soft moderation systems are unable to ascertain if a post supports or refutes a false claim, resulting in a large number of contextual false positives. This limits their effectiveness, for example undermining trust in health experts by adding warnings to their posts or resorting to vague warnings instead of granular fact-checks, which result in desensitizing users. In this paper, we propose to incorporate stance detection into existing automated soft-moderation pipelines, with the goal of ruling out contextual false positives and providing more precise recommendations for social media content that should receive warnings. We develop a textual deviation task called Contrastive Textual Deviation (CTD) and show that it outperforms existing stance detection approaches when applied to soft moderation.We then integrate CTD into the stateof-the-art system for automated soft moderation Lambretta, showing that our approach can reduce contextual false positives from 20% to 2.1%, providing another important building block towards deploying reliable automated soft moderation tools on social media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflicting transactions within blockchain networks not only pose performance challenges but also introduce security vulnerabilities, potentially facilitating malicious attacks. In this paper, we explore the impact of conflicting transactions on blockchain attack vectors. Through modeling and simulation, we delve into the dynamics of four pivotal attacks - block withholding, double spending, balance, and distributed denial of service (DDoS), all orchestrated using conflicting transactions. Our analysis not only focuses on the mechanisms through which these attacks exploit transaction conflicts but also underscores their potential impact on the integrity and reliability of blockchain networks. Additionally, we propose a set of countermeasures for mitigating these attacks. Through implementation and evaluation, we show their effectiveness in lowering attack rates and enhancing overall network performance seamlessly, without introducing additional overhead. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of actively managing conflicting transactions to reinforce blockchain security and performance.</description>

      <title>Securing Proof of Stake Blockchains: Leveraging Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Detecting and Mitigating Malicious Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains offer promising alternatives to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) systems, providing scalability and energy efficiency. However, blockchains operate in a decentralized manner and the network is composed of diverse users. This openness creates the potential for malicious nodes to disrupt the network in various ways. Therefore, it is crucial to embed a mechanism within the blockchain network to constantly monitor, identify, and eliminate these malicious nodes without involving any central authority. In this paper, we propose MRL-PoS+, a novel consensus algorithm to enhance the security of PoS blockchains by leveraging Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MRL) techniques. Our proposed consensus algorithm introduces a penalty-reward scheme for detecting and eliminating malicious nodes. This approach involves the detection of behaviors that can lead to potential attacks in a blockchain network and hence penalizes the malicious nodes, restricting them from performing certain actions. Our developed Proof of Concept demonstrates effectiveness in eliminating malicious nodes for six types of major attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that MRL-PoS+ significantly improves the attack resilience of PoS blockchains compared to the traditional schemes without incurring additional computation overhead.</description>

Abstract: The Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE) protocol provides secure secret exchange (e.g., for key exchange) between two honest parties that need not have had prior contact, and use intermediaries with whom they each securely share confidential data. We show the composable security of the DSKE protocol in the constructive cryptography framework of Maurer. Specifically, we prove the security (correctness and confidentiality) and robustness of this protocol against any computationally unbounded adversary, who additionally may have fully compromised a bounded number of the intermediaries and can eavesdrop on all communication. As DSKE is highly scalable in a network setting with no distance limit, it is expected to be a cost-effective quantum-safe cryptographic solution to safeguarding the network security against the threat of quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: In a biometric authentication or identification system, the matcher compares a stored and a fresh template to determine whether there is a match. This assessment is based on both a similarity score and a predefined threshold. For better compliance with privacy legislation, the matcher can be built upon a privacy-preserving distance. Beyond the binary output (`yes' or `no'), most schemes may perform more precise computations, e.g., the value of the distance. Such precise information is prone to leakage even when not returned by the system. This can occur due to a malware infection or the use of a weakly privacy-preserving distance, exemplified by side channel attacks or partially obfuscated designs. This paper provides an analysis of information leakage during distance evaluation. We provide a catalog of information leakage scenarios with their impacts on data privacy. Each scenario gives rise to unique attacks with impacts quantified in terms of computational costs, thereby providing a better understanding of the security level.</description>

      <title>Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment: A scalable, quantum-proof key distribution system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol for a scalable, cost-effective, information-theoretically secure key distribution and management system. The system, called Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE), relies on pre-shared random numbers between DSKE clients and a group of Security Hubs. Any group of DSKE clients can use the DSKE protocol to distill from the pre-shared numbers a secret key. The clients are protected from Security Hub compromise via a secret sharing scheme that allows the creation of the final key without the need to trust individual Security Hubs. Precisely, if the number of compromised Security Hubs does not exceed a certain threshold, confidentiality is guaranteed to DSKE clients and, at the same time, robustness against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The DSKE system can be used for quantum-secure communication, can be easily integrated into existing network infrastructures, and can support arbitrary groups of communication parties that have access to a key. We discuss the high-level protocol, analyze its security, including its robustness against disruption. A proof-of-principle demonstration of secure communication between two distant clients with a DSKE-based VPN using Security Hubs on Amazon Web Server (AWS) nodes thousands of kilometres away from them was performed, demonstrating the feasibility of DSKE-enabled secret sharing one-time-pad encryption with a data rate above 50 Mbit/s and a latency below 70 ms.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Image Learning: Preserving Performance and Preventing Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>F-KANs: Federated Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative federated learning (FL) approach that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classification tasks. By utilizing the adaptive activation capabilities of KANs in a federated framework, we aim to improve classification capabilities while preserving privacy. The study evaluates the performance of federated KANs (F- KANs) compared to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on classification task. The results show that the F-KANs model significantly outperforms the federated MLP model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and stability, and achieves better performance, paving the way for more efficient and privacy-preserving predictive analytics.</description>
