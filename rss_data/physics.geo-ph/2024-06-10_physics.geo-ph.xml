      <title>Stochastic full waveform inversion with deep generative prior for uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To obtain high-resolution images of subsurface structures from seismic data, seismic imaging techniques such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) serve as crucial tools. However, FWI involves solving a nonlinear and often non-unique inverse problem, presenting challenges such as local minima trapping and inadequate handling of inherent uncertainties. In addressing these challenges, we propose leveraging deep generative models as the prior distribution of geophysical parameters for stochastic Bayesian inversion. This approach integrates the adjoint state gradient for efficient back-propagation from the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Additionally, we introduce explicit and implicit variational Bayesian inference methods. The explicit method computes variational distribution density using a normalizing flow-based neural network, enabling computation of the Bayesian posterior of parameters. Conversely, the implicit method employs an inference network attached to a pretrained generative model to estimate density, incorporating an entropy estimator. Furthermore, we also experimented with the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) method as another variational inference technique, using particles. We compare these variational Bayesian inference methods with conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) sampling. Each method is able to quantify uncertainties and to generate seismic data-conditioned realizations of subsurface geophysical parameters. This framework provides insights into subsurface structures while accounting for inherent uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advance geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion, based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. We evaluated the modified full waveform inversion with several tunnel fault models by comparing the results of the enhanced method with those of traditional least squares-based Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization full waveform inversion methods. The verification results confirm the superior capabilities of the proposed method as expected.</description>
