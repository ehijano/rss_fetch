      <title>A Fundamental Duality in the Mathematical and Natural Sciences: From Logic to Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an essay in what might be called ``mathematical metaphysics.'' There is a fundamental duality that run through mathematics and the natural sciences. The duality starts as the logical level; it is represented by the Boolean logic of subsets and the logic of partitions since subsets and partitions are category-theoretic dual concepts. In more basic terms, it starts with the duality between the elements (Its) of subsets and the distinctions (Dits, i.e., ordered pairs of elements in different blocks) of a partition. Mathematically, the Its $\&amp;$ Dits duality is fully developed in category theory as the reverse-the-arrows duality. The quantitative versions of subsets and partitions are developed as probability theory and information theory (based on logical entropy). Classical physics was based on a view of reality as definite all the way down. In contrast, quantum physics embodies (objective) indefiniteness. And finally, there are the two fundamental dual mechanisms at work in biology, the selectionist mechanism and the generative mechanism, two mechanisms that embody the fundamental duality.</description>

      <title>Do We Live in an Antigravity Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.10954 I showed that, in the context of antigravity (i.e., matter and antimatter repel gravitationally), quark/lepton mass-energy is matter and antiquark/antilepton mass-energy is antimatter while the mass-energy of the intermediate vector bosons (e.g., the photon and $W^+$) also has to be considered matter. One consequence of this is that the antiproton (and, hence, the antineutron) is dominantly composed of matter since some two-thirds of its mass is gluonic. Under this premise I found that the gravitational acceleration of antihydrogen would be $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.33^{+0.10}_{-0.06})g$. This is to be compared to the ALPHA-g result of $a_{\bar{H}}=(0.75\pm 0.13~({\rm stat.+syst.})\pm 0.16~({\rm simulation}))g$. In this article I explore the cosmological implications of this definition of matter and antimatter. This leads to a quite different antigravity universe than previous analyses with, for example, equal amounts of hydrogen and antihydrogen but far fewer antistars than stars. I examine the observations used to extract various parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model of the universe and show that they are potentially consistent with the characteristics of the antigravity universe. A precise version of antigravity, one which must include General Relativity, is needed to generate a fully consistent, predictive model of the antigravity universe but even without it the antigravity scenario outlined here naturally leads to a rich phenomenology including different acceleration and expansion rates between the early universe and the present, MOND-like galaxy rotation curves, cosmic voids, and more.</description>

      <title>Covariance in Fractional Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the requirement of covariance, we propose a new approach for generalizing fractional calculus in multi-dimensional space. As a first application we calculate an approximation for the ground state energy of the fractional 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator using the Ritz variational principle.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement with the biased Werner density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separability of quantum systems, particularly in mixed states, remains a fundamental challenge in quantum mechanics. The Werner density matrix, a widely studied representation of bipartite mixed quantum systems, has provided valuable insights into entanglement, nonlocality, and separability. In this work, we propose an extension to the Werner density matrix by introducing a classical bias while preserving the independence of the two particles. Using the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion, we demonstrate that this biased Werner density matrix enlarges the entangled state region, suggesting that the classical bias enhances the formation of quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we show that the entanglement enhancement persists when classical dependence is introduced, indicating that bias is the key factor driving this effect. Our results suggest that careful mixing of classical and quantum components can render a state separable, even when both components exhibit correlations and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Relativistic Bohmian Model of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the recently presented Two-Time relativistic Bohmian Model (TTBM) is first rigorously and thoroughly summarized: definition, salient properties and observational explanations (double-slit experiment). Secondly, the theory is applied to a generic spherical atomic orbit, obtaining oscillations of the electron in the new time dimension, tau, that demonstrate the static nature of the orbitals. Something very similar happens in the case of a particle in box, where tau-oscillations cause the particle to spread out at steady states. Some speculations about spin and astrophysical follow. Finally, strengths and pending tasks of the model are summarized.</description>
