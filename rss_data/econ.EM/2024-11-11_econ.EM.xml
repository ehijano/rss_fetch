      <title>Inference for Treatment Effects Conditional on Generalized Principal Strata using Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a setting with a multi-valued outcome, treatment and instrument, this paper considers the problem of inference for a general class of treatment effect parameters. The class of parameters considered are those that can be expressed as the expectation of a function of the response type conditional on a generalized principal stratum. Here, the response type simply refers to the vector of potential outcomes and potential treatments, and a generalized principal stratum is a set of possible values for the response type. In addition to instrument exogeneity, the main substantive restriction imposed rules out certain values for the response types in the sense that they are assumed to occur with probability zero. It is shown through a series of examples that this framework includes a wide variety of parameters and assumptions that have been considered in the previous literature. A key result in our analysis is a characterization of the identified set for such parameters under these assumptions in terms of existence of a non-negative solution to linear systems of equations with a special structure. We propose methods for inference exploiting this special structure and recent results in Fang et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>Detecting Cointegrating Relations in Non-stationary Matrix-Valued Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Matrix Error Correction Model to identify cointegration relations in matrix-valued time series. We hereby allow separate cointegrating relations along the rows and columns of the matrix-valued time series and use information criteria to select the cointegration ranks. Through Monte Carlo simulations and a macroeconomic application, we demonstrate that our approach provides a reliable estimation of the number of cointegrating relationships.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting distributions: a functional MIDAS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a functional MIDAS model to leverage high-frequency information for forecasting and nowcasting distributions observed at a lower frequency. We approximate the low-frequency distribution using Functional Principal Component Analysis and consider a group lasso spike-and-slab prior to identify the relevant predictors in the finite-dimensional SUR-MIDAS approximation of the functional MIDAS model. In our application, we use the model to nowcast the U.S. households' income distribution. Our findings indicate that the model enhances forecast accuracy for the entire target distribution and for key features of the distribution that signal changes in inequality.</description>

      <title>Firm Heterogeneity and Macroeconomic Fluctuations: a Functional VAR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Functional Augmented Vector Autoregression (FunVAR) model to explicitly incorporate firm-level heterogeneity observed in more than one dimension and study its interaction with aggregate macroeconomic fluctuations. Our methodology employs dimensionality reduction techniques for tensor data objects to approximate the joint distribution of firm-level characteristics. More broadly, our framework can be used for assessing predictions from structural models that account for micro-level heterogeneity observed on multiple dimensions. Leveraging firm-level data from the Compustat database, we use the FunVAR model to analyze the propagation of total factor productivity (TFP) shocks, examining their impact on both macroeconomic aggregates and the cross-sectional distribution of capital and labor across firms.</description>

      <title>On the limiting variance of matching estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the limiting variance of nearest neighbor matching estimators for average treatment effects with a fixed number of matches. We present, for the first time, a closed-form expression for this limit. Here the key is the establishment of the limiting second moment of the catchment area's volume, which resolves a question of Abadie and Imbens. At the core of our approach is a new universality theorem on the measures of high-order Voronoi cells, extending a result by Devroye, Gy\"orfi, Lugosi, and Walk.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Webs: Systemic Risk in Software Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern software development is a collaborative effort that re-uses existing code to reduce development and maintenance costs. This practice exposes software to vulnerabilities in the form of undetected bugs in direct and indirect dependencies, as demonstrated by the Crowdstrike and HeartBleed bugs. The economic costs resulting from such vulnerabilities can be staggering. We study a directed network of 52,897 software dependencies across 16,102 Python repositories, guided by a strategic model of network formation that incorporates both observable and unobservable heterogeneity. Using a scalable variational approximation of the conditional distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, we show that outsourcing code to other software packages by creating dependencies generates negative externalities. Modeling the propagation of risk in networks of software packages as an epidemiological process, we show that increasing protection of dependencies based on popular heuristics is ineffective at reducing systemic risk. By contrast, AI-assisted coding enables developers to replace dependencies with in-house code and reduces systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Randomly Assigned First Differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider treatment-effect estimation with a two-periods panel, using a first-difference regression of the outcome evolution $\Delta Y_g$ on the treatment evolution $\Delta D_g$. To justify this regression, one may assume that $\Delta D_g$ is as good as randomly assigned, namely uncorrelated to the residual of the first-differenced model and to the treatment's effect. This note shows that if one posits a causal model in levels between the treatment and the outcome, then the residual of the first-differenced model is a function of $D_{g,1}$, so $\Delta D_g$ uncorrelated to that residual essentially implies that $\Delta D_g$ is uncorrelated to $D_{g,1}$. This is a strong, testable condition. If $\Delta D_g$ is correlated to $D_{g,1}$, assuming that $\Delta D_g$ is uncorrelated to the treatment effect and to the remaining terms of the residual may not be sufficient to have that the first-difference regression identifies a convex combination of treatment effects. I use these results to revisit Acemoglu et al (2016).</description>
