      <title>A nanoindentation study of attenuation in geological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic behavior in geological materials controls a wide range of geophysical phenomena, such as mantle convection. We present a new method for measuring attenuation in single crystals of minerals and in reference materials over a frequency range of 1-1e-4 Hz via nanoindentation. In the experiments, we calculate the phase lag between a sinusoidal load applied to the tip of the nanoindenter and its displacement into and out of the tested sample, which provides a measure of the inverse quality factor 1/Q (i.e., attenuation) of the sample. Experiments were conducted on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), indium, halite, olivine and quartz. Attenuation spectrum from our tests on PMMA and indium are in excellent agreement with reported values from past studies. We quantified the natural damping of the nanoindenter and show that it becomes comparable to that of the samples at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz, but is much lower at lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>Method for processing and analyzing tectonic earthquake aftershocks: A new look at old problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deactivation coefficient has been introduced for the source that cools down after the mainshock of the earthquake. The deactivation coefficient satisfies two conditions. First, it can be computed from observed aftershock frequency data (axiom of computability). Second, the deactivation factor is independent of time if and only if Omori law is strictly satisfied (hyperbolicity axiom). From the two axioms follows an explicit expression for calculating the source deactivation factor from observed aftershock data. A simple and efficient method for processing and analyzing aftershocks using the deactivation factor has been developed. A two-stage mode of the source relaxation to a new equilibrium state after the formation of the main rupture of rock continuity in it was discovered. In the first stage, called the Omori epoch, the Omori law is strictly followed. The duration of the first stage is tentatively 10 to 100 days. In the Omori epoch, the average frequency of aftershocks is predictable with high accuracy. At the end of the Omori epoch, a bifurcation occurs. In the second stage, the deactivation factor changes with time in an unpredictable way. The phase portrait of the source allows us to visualize the complex dynamics of seismic activity in the second stage of the source relaxation. The experiment shows that the Hirano-Utsu law is inapplicable for describing the evolution of aftershocks neither at the first nor at the second stage of the source relaxation. Keywords: deactivation factor, evolution equation, phase portrait, Omori law, Hirano-Utsu law.</description>

      <title>A Generative Machine Learning Approach for Improving Precipitation from Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the impacts of anthropogenic global warming requires accurate Earth system model (ESM) simulations. Statistical bias correction and downscaling can be applied to reduce errors and increase the resolution of ESMs. However, existing methods, such as quantile mapping, cannot effectively improve spatial patterns or temporal dynamics. We address this problem with a purely generative machine learning approach, combining unpaired domain translation with a super-resolution foundation model. Our results show realistic spatial patterns and temporal dynamics as well as reduced distributional biases in the processed ESM simulation.</description>

      <title>On acoustic space-time media that compute their own inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive time reflection and transmission coefficients for 1D acoustic waves encountering a time boundary at which the properties of the medium change instantaneously. The time reflection and transmission coefficients are shown to be identical to so-called reverse-space reflection and transmission coefficients which appear in the recursive computation of focusing wavefields used in seismology. We establish a bijectivity between the focusing wavefields and the wavefields produced by time scattering and show how this can be used to construct a space-time medium where the time scattering anticipates the space scattering and "computes" the exact inverse for the space scattering. The construction is shown to be independent of the boundary conditions chosen to compute the reflection and transmission coefficients. We demonstrate the construction with a simple numerical example of a single pulse encountering a series of time boundaries before reaching a spatial inhomogeneity. The time boundaries scatter the single pulse into a focusing wavefield that subsequently focuses through the spatial inhomogeneity. Under certain conditions, the transmitted wave has both the same wave shape and amplitude as the original pulse, yielding a transmission coefficient of unity. The reflection coefficient of the space-time medium is always non-zero however.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Global Simulation of Nonlocal Gravity Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>A granular scaling approach to landslide runout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main objective in landslide research is to predict how far they will travel. Landslides are complex, and a complete understanding in principle requires accounting for numerous parameters. Here we engender a simplification by investigating the maximum landslide runout using granular laboratory experiments and a scaling analysis. We find that correctly accounting for the fall height and grain size distribution not only yields an improved correlation of normalized runout, but also quantitatively unites laboratory and field data. In particular, we find that the mobility of landslides increases with the square root of the fall height and with the skewness of the grain size distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory granular landslides are smaller-scale, simplified, yet well-controlled versions of larger and often tragic natural landslides. Using systematic experiments and scaling analysis, we quantify the influence of grain size, fall height, and landslide volume on runout distance. We also determine the minimum landslide size required to observe this scaling, which we find is set by a combination of air drag, grain size, and fall height.</description>

      <title>Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic dipole stability and zonal flow changes controlled by mantle heat flux heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palaeomagnetic evidence shows that the behaviour of the geodynamo has changed during geological times. Variations in the heat flux at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) due to mantle convection could be responsible. Previous studies, based on unrealistically viscous dynamo simulations, have shown that large-scale CMB heat flux heterogeneities impact the magnetic dipole stability. To better understand how they affect the geodynamo, we used several simulations, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong-field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heterogeneities with realistic amplitudes can favour a multipolar dynamo by either forcing equatorially antisymmetric zonal flows or eastward zonal flows. Strong-field dynamo models are found to be less sensitive, due to significant westward flows. We also find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field is best captured by $M^*=M\ E_{\eta}\ \dfrac{l_c}{\pi}$ where $M$ is the magnetic to kinetic energy ratio, $E_{\eta}$ is the magnetic Ekman number, and $l_c$ is the dominant harmonic degree of the flow, with multipolar dynamos found at lower $M^*$. $M^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows in our simulations consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.</description>

      <title>SFY -- A lightweight, high-frequency and phase-resolving wave-buoy for coastal waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small lightweight wave buoys, SFYs, designed to operate near the coast, have been developed. The buoys are designed to record and transmit the full time series of surface acceleration at $52$ Hz. The buoy uses the cellular network to transfer data and position (up to $80$ km from the base station). This reduces costs and increases band-width. The low cost and low weight permits the buoys to be deployed easily, and in arrays in areas where satellite and wave models struggle to resolve wave and current interaction. The buoys are tested in a wave-flume, the open water and in the breaking waves of the surf. The conditions range from calm to significant wave heights exceeding $7$ m and crashing breakers with accelerations exceeding $10$ g. The high sample rate captures the impulse of breaking waves, and allows them to be studied in detail. Breaking waves are measured and quantified in the open water. We measure breaking waves in the surf and recover the trajectory of waves breaking in the field to a higher degree than previously done. The time series of surface elevation, and accurate positioning, permits the signal of adjacent buoys to be correlated in a coherent phase-resolved way. Finally, we offer an explanation and solution for the ubiquitous low-frequency noise in IMU-based buoys and discuss necessary sampling and design to measure in areas of breaking waves.</description>
