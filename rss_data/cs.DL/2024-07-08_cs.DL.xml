      <title>Top Research Performance Over Time: A Multidimensional Micro-Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the contribution of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992-2021) is explored. Four classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10%) are examined using four productivity measurements. A temporal stability of productivity patterns is found: the upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The 1/10 and the 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades studied. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are over-represented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors changing the odds ratio estimates of membership in top performance classes: gender, academic age, and publishing patterns. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied. Implications for high productivity studies are shown, and limitations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Are Scientists Changing their Research Productivity Classes When They Move Up the Academic Ladder?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach productivity in science in a longitudinal fashion: We track careers over time, up to 40 years. We first allocate scientists to decile-based publishing productivity classes, from the bottom 10% to the top 10%. Then, we seek patterns of mobility between the classes in two career stages: assistant professorship and associate professorship. Our findings confirm that radically changing publishing productivity levels (upward or downward) almost never happens. Scientists with a very weak past track record in publications emerge as having marginal chances of becoming scientists with a very strong future track record across all science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields. Hence, our research shows a long-term character of careers in science, with publishing productivity during the apprenticeship period of assistant professorship heavily influencing productivity during the more independent period of associate professorship. We use individual-level microdata on academic careers (from a national registry of scientists) and individual-level metadata on publications (from the Scopus raw dataset). Polish associate professors tend to be stuck in their productivity classes for years: High performers tend to remain high performers, and low performers tend to remain low performers over their careers. Logistic regression analysis powerfully supports our two-dimensional results. We examine all internationally visible Polish associate professors in five fields of science in STEMM fields (N = 4,165 with N art = 71,841 articles).</description>

      <title>How to Write Beautiful Process-and-Data-Science Papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After 25 years of PhD supervision, the author noted typical recurring problems that make papers look sloppy, difficult to read, and incoherent. The goal is not to write a paper for the sake of writing a paper, but to convey a valuable message that is clear and precise. The goal is to write papers that have an impact and are still understandable a couple of decades later. Our mission should be to create papers of high quality that people want to read and that can stand the test of time. We use Dijkstra's adagium "Beauty Is Our Business" to stress the importance of simplicity, correctness, and cleanness.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Tree-structured Knowledge Graph For Academic Insight Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04854v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research surveys have always posed a challenge for beginner researchers who lack of research training. These researchers struggle to understand the directions within their research topic, and the discovery of new research findings within a short time. One way to provide intuitive assistance to beginner researchers is by offering relevant knowledge graphs(KG) and recommending related academic papers. However, existing navigation knowledge graphs primarily rely on keywords in the research field and often fail to present the logical hierarchy among multiple related papers clearly. Moreover, most recommendation systems for academic papers simply rely on high text similarity, which can leave researchers confused as to why a particular article is being recommended. They may lack of grasp important information about the insight connection between "Issue resolved" and "Issue finding" that they hope to obtain. To address these issues, this study aims to support research insight surveys for beginner researchers by establishing a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects the inheritance insight of research topics and the relevance insight among the academic papers.</description>

      <title>Object Recognition from Scientific Document based on Compartment Refinement Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the internet in the past decade, it has become increasingly important to extract valuable information from vast resources efficiently, which is crucial for establishing a comprehensive digital ecosystem, particularly in the context of research surveys and comprehension. The foundation of these tasks focuses on accurate extraction and deep mining of data from scientific documents, which are essential for building a robust data infrastructure. However, parsing raw data or extracting data from complex scientific documents have been ongoing challenges. Current data extraction methods for scientific documents typically use rule-based (RB) or machine learning (ML) approaches. However, using rule-based methods can incur high coding costs for articles with intricate typesetting. Conversely, relying solely on machine learning methods necessitates annotation work for complex content types within the scientific document, which can be costly. Additionally, few studies have thoroughly defined and explored the hierarchical layout within scientific documents. The lack of a comprehensive definition of the internal structure and elements of the documents indirectly impacts the accuracy of text classification and object recognition tasks. From the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified publication, we propose a new document layout analysis framework called CTBR(Compartment &amp; Text Blocks Refinement). Firstly, we define scientific documents into hierarchical divisions: base domain, compartment, and text blocks. Next, we conduct an in-depth exploration and classification of the meanings of text blocks. Finally, we utilize the results of text block classification to implement object recognition within scientific documents based on rule-based compartment segmentation.</description>
