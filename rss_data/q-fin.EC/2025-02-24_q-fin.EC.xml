      <title>Accelerating Equity: Overcoming the Gender Gap in VC Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the growing gender gap in venture capital funding, focusing on accelerator programs in the U.S. We collect a unique dataset with detailed information on accelerators and startups. Using a two-stage methodology, we first estimate a matching model between startups and accelerators, and then use its output to analyze the gender gap in post-graduation outcomes through a control function approach. Our results show that female-founded startups face a significant funding disadvantage, primarily due to relocation challenges tied to family obligations. However, larger cohorts and higher-quality accelerators help reduce this gap by offering female founders better networking opportunities and mentorship.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion under Observed Demand Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the current demand shock is observable, with a high discount factor, Q-learning agents predominantly learn to implement symmetric rigid pricing, i.e., they charge constant prices across demand states. Under this pricing pattern, supra-competitive profits can still be obtained and are sustained through collusive strategies that effectively punish deviations. This shows that Q-learning agents can successfully overcome the stronger incentives to deviate during the positive demand shocks, and consequently algorithmic collusion persists under observed demand shocks. In contrast, with a medium discount factor, Q-learning agents learn that maintaining high prices during the positive demand shocks is not incentive compatible and instead proactively charge lower prices to decrease the temptation for deviating, while maintaining relatively high prices during the negative demand shocks. As a result, the countercyclical pricing pattern becomes predominant, aligning with the theoretical prediction of Rotemberg and Saloner (1986). These findings highlight how Q-learning algorithms can both adapt pricing strategies and develop tacit collusion in response to complex market conditions.</description>

      <title>Blockchain innovation in promoting employment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology, though conceptualized in the early 1990s, only gained practical relevance with Bitcoin's launch in 2009. Recent advancements have demonstrated its transformative potential, particularly in the digital art and global payment sectors. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have redefined digital ownership, while financial institutions use blockchain to enhance cross-border transactions, reducing costs and settlement times. Using the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model, this paper examines blockchain's impact on labor markets by improving job-matching efficiency, thereby reducing unemployment. However, high research costs and competition with incumbent technologies hinder early-stage blockchain adoption. We extend the DMP model to analyze the role of government intervention through tax and wage policies in mitigating these barriers. Our findings suggest that lowering firm tax rates can accelerate blockchain innovation, enhance labor market efficiency, and promote employment growth, highlighting the critical balance between technological progress and economic policy in fostering blockchain-driven economic transformation.</description>
