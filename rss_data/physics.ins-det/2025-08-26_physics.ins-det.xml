      <title>First stave results towards mitigating sensor fracturing with interposers in the ATLAS ITk strips barrel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the conclusion of Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the accelerator complex will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), allowing it to increase the dataset sizes of LHC experiments by about a factor of 20. This significant increase in dataset size will improve the sensitivity and precision of all physics analyses from LHC experiments, but will come with a more challenging data-taking environment. In order to handle this, the ATLAS detector will undergo a substantial upgrade, including an upgrade of its inner tracker to an all-silicon tracker called the Inner Tracker (ITk), made of pixel and strip sub-detectors. During the pre-production phase of the ITk strips, it was discovered that thermally cycling modules loaded onto local support structures led to physical fractures in silicon sensors due to the induced thermal stress. This is understood to be the result of several factors, including the difference in coefficients of thermal expansion between the different module layers, and the close proximity of the module electrical components. Several mitigation strategies were tested to reduce the rate of module fracturing. This paper describes the assembly setup, testing setups, and electrical testing results of ITk strips barrel modules loaded onto local support structures. 69 of 70 modules with an in-built additional kapton layer were found to survive testing down to -70{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Optics for broadband x-ray ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional x-ray ptychography, diffraction data is collected by scanning a sample through a monochromatic, and spatially coherent, x-ray beam. A high-resolution image is then retrieved using an iterative algorithm. Combined with a scan of the incident photon energy, it is also possible to access chemical and elemental information. Although powerful, the high brilliance required currently constrains the method to 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron sources and long scanning times. An alternative approach is to use a broadband illumination in combination with an energy resolving detector. These detectors record the data in a series of energy channels simultaneously, creating a stack of coherent data suitable for a ptychographic reconstruction. This approach promises to unlock the full power of the radiation source and provide spectral imaging at a higher rate and in a single acquisition. However, these detectors currently saturate well below reaching the flux rates produced at synchrotrons, which is preventing the uptake of this approach. Furthermore, current monochromatic synchrotron setups typically employ Fresnel zone plates for pre-sample focusing due to their stability, flexibility, and affordability, but these diffractive optics limit the spectral bandwidth that the setup can accept. In this article, we analyze the problem and consider alternative optics that can both maximize the total photon detection rates and broaden the tolerable bandwidth. Broadband x-ray ptychography has the potential to dramatically reduce data collection times at synchrotron sources, but also to harness the full power of lower brilliance sources and transition x-ray ptychography into a laboratory technique.</description>

      <title>Spiral Tuning of Wire-metamaterial Cavity for Plasma Haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that provide a compelling solution to two major mysteries in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this study, we present a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by bundling the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of approximately 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. To validate this concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity comprising six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, achieving results in good agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hyperspectral imaging with optical microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionised time and frequency metrology [1, 2]. The advent of microresonator-based frequency combs ('microcombs' [3-5]) is set to lead to the miniaturisation of devices that are ideally suited to a wide range of applications, including microwave generation [6, 7], ranging [8-10], the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs [11], neuromorphic computing [12, 13], high-bandwidth data communications[14], and quantum-optics [15, 16] platforms. Here, we introduce a new microcomb application for three-dimensional imaging. Our method can simultaneously determine the chemical identity and full three-dimensional geometry, including size, shape, depth, and spatial coordinates, of particulate matter ranging from micrometres to millimetres in size across nearly $10^5$ distinct image pixels. We demonstrate our technique using millimetre-sized plastic specimens (i.e. microplastics measuring less than 5 mm). We combine amplitude and phase analysis and achieve a throughput exceeding $1.2~10^6$ pixels per second with micrometre-scale precision. Our method leverages the defining feature of microcombs - their large line spacing - to enable precise spectral diagnostics using microcombs with a repetition frequency of 1 THz. Our results suggest scalable operation over several million pixels and nanometre-scale axial resolution. Coupled with its high-speed, label-free and multiplexed capabilities, our approach provides a promising basis for environmental sensing, particularly for the real-time detection and characterisation of microplastic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems [17].</description>

      <title>Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments at the RIBF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of high-intensity radioactive ion beams has opened new avenues for nuclear structure research. By studying exotic ions, phenomena such as shell evolution, halos, and the limits of stability have been studied. In particular, Quasi-Free Scattering (QFS) experiments on hydrogen targets have proven to be a valuable tool to investigate the structure of exotic ions. Recently, a series of QFS experiments were performed at the Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) of the RIKEN Nishina Center employing the MINOS liquid hydrogen system. A fundamental part of the success of these experiments was the use of dedicated devices to measure the gamma-rays, charged particles, and neutrons emitted in the reactions. The experience gained during the past campaigns, as well as the upcoming upgrade of the RIBF facility call for improvements on the existing devices, as well as for the development of new detection systems. Here we review the main detection devices used at the RIBF for QFS experiments, and give an overview of the ongoing and upcoming developments.</description>

      <title>Operation and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker with proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Salient aspects of the commissioning, calibration, and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker are discussed, drawing on experience during operation with proton-proton collisions delivered by the CERN LHC. The data were obtained with a variety of luminosities. The operating temperature of the strip tracker was changed several times during this period and results are shown as a function of temperature in several cases. Details of the system performance are presented, including occupancy, signal-to-noise ratio, Lorentz angle, and single-hit spatial resolution. Saturation effects in the APV25 readout chip preamplifier observed during early Run 2 are presented, showing the effect on various observables and the subsequent remedy. Studies of radiation effects on the strip tracker are presented both for the optical readout links and the silicon sensors. The observed effects are compared to simulation, where available, and they generally agree well with expectations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>

      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>
