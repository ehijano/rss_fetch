      <title>Unimodular Valuations beyond Ehrhart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of unimodular valuations on the set of lattice polygons with values in the spaces of polynomials and formal power series, respectively, is established. The valuations are classified in terms of their behaviour with respect to dilation using extensions to unbounded polyhedra and basic invariant theory.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of 4-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a two-dimensional Lorentzian problem on the anti-de Sitter plane. Using methods of geometric control theory and differential geometry, it was possible to construct an orthonormal frame, calculate extremal trajectories, describe the reachable set, construct an optimal synthesis, and describe the Lorentzian distance.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian problems on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two left-invariant Lorentzian problems on the Heisenberg group are considered. The Pontryagin maximum principle was applied to both problems and a parameterization of abnormal and normal extremal trajectories was obtained. Reachability sets and the existence of optimal trajectories are investigated.</description>

      <title>Square pegs between two graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there always exists an inscribed square in a Jordan curve given as the union of two graphs of functions of Lipschitz constant less than $1 + \sqrt{2}$. We are motivated by Tao's result that there exists such a square in the case of Lipschitz constant less than $1$. In the case of Lipschitz constant $1$, we show that the Jordan curve inscribes rectangles of every similarity class. Our approach involves analysing the change in the spectral invariants of the Jordan Floer homology under perturbations of the Jordan curve.</description>

      <title>Geodesics in planar Poisson roads random metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of geodesics in the fractal random metric constructed by Kendall from a self-similar Poisson process of roads (i.e, lines with speed limits) in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In particular, we prove a conjecture of Kendall stating that geodesics do not pause en route, i.e, use roads of arbitrary small speed except at their endpoints. It follows that the geodesic frame of $\left(\mathbb{R}^2,T\right)$ is the set of points on roads. We also consider geodesic stars and hubs, and give a complete description of the local structure of geodesics around points on roads. Notably, we prove that leaving a road by driving off-road is never geodesic.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>
