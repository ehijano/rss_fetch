      <title>Scalings and simulation requirements in two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, important two-phase flow scalings are derived, which enable the quantification of grid-point and time-step requirements as functions of Re, We, and Ca numbers. The adequate grid resolution is determined in the inertia-dominated regime with the aid of high-fidelity simulations of stationary two-phase homogeneous isotropic turbulence by evaluating convergence of total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution. Although standards for DNS for single-phase turbulence flow exist, there is a lack of similar guidance in two-phase flows. Therefore, length scale ratios of the Kolmogorov-Hinze to the Kolmogorov scale of \eta_{KH}/\eta \sim We_{L}^{-3/5}Re_{L}^{3/4} in the inertia-dominated regime and the Kolmogorov-viscous to Kolmogorov scale of \eta_{KV}/\eta \sim Ca_{L}^{-1}Re_{L}^{3/4} for the viscous-dominated regime, are constructed. These scalings imply a computational cost increase like We_{L}^{12/5} and Ca_{L}^4, in the inertia-dominated and viscous-dominated regimes, respectively. A novel dimensionless number, coined as the ratio of interface scales (Ris), is proposed to aid in the classification of the turbulence regimes in the presence of an interface. Convergence of the total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution are observed for grid resolutions of k_{\max} \eta_{KH} \geq 60$ for second-order schemes. Furthermore, it is observed that this lower bound is the minimum required to capture intermittent events responsible for the increase of instantaneous total interfacial area. This criterion will be a valuable tool for determining grid resolution and time-step requirements a-priori for DNS of two-phase flows and for estimating the corresponding computational cost. This work provides guidelines and best practices for numerical simulations of two-phase flows, which will accelerate physics discovery and model development.</description>

      <title>Effect of Stokes number on erosion on Pelton buckets for sediment-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increased glacial melting and the need to maintain sediment continuity for ecosystem health, sediment-laden flows through hydropower plants are becoming increasingly problematic, particularly due to erosion on runner blades and buckets. A widely used mitigation strategy is the use of filters to protect Pelton turbines. However, these filters lead to rapid sediment accumulation in reservoirs, which must be drained frequently to maintain storage capacity. The high cost of such drainage operations calls for longer intervals between them, without compromising runner integrity, as erosion-induced stress concentrations may cause bucket rupture. A better understanding of the causes of runner erosion under varying operational and sediment conditions is essential to allow more sediment to pass through the hydraulic machine safely. This study investigates how sediment-laden flow through the nozzle affects particle distribution in the jet for different Stokes numbers. Furthermore, it analyses how a realistic particle size and spatial distribution in the impacting jet compares to the assumption of a uniform particle distribution with particles of mean size when simulating bucket erosion in Pelton wheels. The results show that the particle distribution in the jet follows a similar axisymmetric shape for low Stokes numbers whereas at higher Stokes numbers it becomes asymmetric. Additionally, it is shown that imposing uniform particle distribution with particles of mean diameter under-predicts tip- and splitter erosion when simulating the erosion on the bucket but is captured by imposing the realistic size and spatial distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalised actuator disk theory: wake development with turbulent entrainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical actuator disk theory, developed more than a century ago, provides an idealised description of turbine rotor performance. It treats a rotor as an infinitesimally-thin permeable disk and applies the governing flow equations over a streamtube encompassing the disk. A well-known limitation of the theory is its assumption of ideal flow downstream of the disk, which restricts its applicability to short downwind distances before turbulence and mixing processes governing the wake evolution take hold. As a result, the classical theory also leads to unphysical predictions for highly-loaded rotors. Turbulent axisymmetric wakes, by contrast, represent an extensively-studied canonical free shear flow with much of the progress and its applications to wind turbines limited to the far-wake dynamics. In this work, we introduce a generalised actuator disk theory based on a hybrid stream-tube and wake control volume, that seamlessly integrates classical actuator disk analysis with wake turbulence modelling at arbitrary distances from the rotor. The resulting model, while still idealised, can be used to predict variations in velocity, pressure, and cross-sectional flow area as function of position, both upstream and downstream of the rotor disk. Furthermore, by accounting for turbulent entrainment in the wake development, it provides more realistic predictions of thrust and power coefficients for highly-loaded disks.</description>

      <title>Ultra-chaotic property of Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chaotic system is called ultra-chaos when its statistics have sensitivity dependence on initial condition and/or other small disturbances. In this paper, using two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow as an example, we illustrate that tiny variation of initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations can lead to huge differences not only in spatiotemporal trajectory but also in flow symmetry and its statistics. Here, in order to avoid the influence of artificial numerical noise, we apply ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS) which can guarantee that the numerical noise can be reduced to such a desired low level that they are negligible in a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. This discovery highly suggests that the Navier-Stokes turbulence (i.e. turbulence governed by the Navier-Stokes equations) might be an ultra-chaos, say, small disturbances must be considered even from viewpoint of statistics. This however leads to a paradox in logic, since small disturbances, which are unavoidable in practice, are unfortunately neglected by the Navier-Stokes turbulence. Some fundamental characteristics of turbulence model are discussed and suggested in general meanings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear System Identification for Model-Based Control of Waked Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a nonlinear system identification framework for modeling the power extraction dynamics of wind turbines, including both freestream and waked conditions. The approach models turbine dynamics using data-driven power coefficient maps expressed as combinations of compact radial basis functions and polynomial bases, parameterized in terms of tip-speed ratio and upstream conditions. These surrogate models are embedded in a first-order dynamic system suitable for model-based control. Experimental validation is carried out in two wind tunnel configurations: a low-turbulence tandem setup and a high-turbulence wind farm scenario. In the tandem case, the identified model is integrated into an adapted K\omega^2 controller, resulting in improved tip-speed ratio tracking and power stability compared to BEM-based and steady-state models. In the wind farm scenario, the model captures the statistical behavior of the turbines despite unresolved turbulence. The proposed method enables interpretable, adaptive control across a range of operating conditions without relying on black-box learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired Tapered-Spring Turbulence Sensor for Underwater Flow Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a bio-inspired underwater whisker sensor for robust hydrodynamic disturbance detection and efficient signal analysis based on Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC). The design uses a tapered nylon spring with embedded accelerometers to achieve spatially distributed vibration sensing and frequency separation along the whisker. Towing-tank experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed that the whisker effectively distinguishes vortex regimes across different fin angles and maintains Strouhal scaling with flow velocity, where higher speeds increase vibration intensity without affecting the dominant frequencies. Frequency-domain analysis, Shannon entropy, and machine learning further validated the sensing performance: vortex shedding frequencies were identified with less than 10\% error, entropy captured the transition from coherent vortex streets to turbulence, and logistic regression achieved 86.0\% classification accuracy with millisecond-level inference. These results demonstrate that structurally encoded whisker sensing provides a scalable and real-time solution for underwater perception, wake tracking, and turbulence-aware navigation in autonomous marine robots.</description>

      <title>Targeted Digital Twin via Flow Map Learning and Its Application to Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin (tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing full flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Continuum Theory of Magnetic Particles in High-Gradient Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particles underpin a broad range of technologies, from water purification and mineral processing to bioseparations and targeted drug delivery. The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic fields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the coupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field feedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on empirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle transport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a free-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and steric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via homogenization theory. The resulting equations unify magnetism, mass transport, and momentum balances without ad hoc shut-off criteria, allowing field shielding, anisotropic deposition, and boundary-layer confinement to emerge naturally. Simulations predict canonical capture morphologies-axially aligned plumes, crescent-shaped deposits, and nonlinear shielding-across field strengths and flow regimes, consistent with trends reported in prior experimental and modeling studies. By organizing captured particle mass data into a dimensionless phase diagram based on the Mason number, we reveal three distinct regimes-thermodynamically controlled, transitional, and dynamically controlled. This perspective provides a predictive platform for in silico optimization and extension to three-dimensional geometries, and informing digital twin development for industrial-scale high-gradient magnetic separation processes.</description>

      <title>On the enhancement of boundary layer skin friction by turbulence: an angular momentum approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence enhances the wall shear stress in boundary layers, significantly increasing the drag on streamlined bodies. Other flow features such as freestream pressure gradients and streamwise boundary layer growth also strongly influence the skin friction. In this paper, an angular momentum integral (AMI) equation is introduced to quantify these effects by representing them as torques that alter the shape of the mean velocity profile. This approach uniquely isolates the skin friction of a Blasius boundary layer in a single term that depends only on the Reynolds number, so that other torques are interpreted as augmentations relative to the laminar case having the same Reynolds number. The AMI equation for external flows shares this key property with the so-called FIK relation for internal flows [Fukagata et al. 2002, Phys. Fluids, \textbf{14}, L73-L76]. Without a geometrically imposed boundary layer thickness, the length scale in the Reynolds number for the AMI equation may be chosen freely. After a brief demonstration using Falkner-Skan boundary layers, the AMI equation is applied as a diagnostic tool on four transitional and turbulent boundary layer DNS datasets. Regions of negative wall-normal velocity are shown to play a key role in limiting the peak skin friction during the late stages of transition, and the relative strengths of terms in the AMI equation become independent of the transition mechanism a very short distance into the fully-turbulent regime. The AMI equation establishes an intuitive, extensible framework for interpreting the impact of turbulence and flow control strategies on boundary layer skin friction.</description>

      <title>Resolvent model-based analyses of coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence, a state of the ocean surface boundary layer driven by the interactions between water waves and wind-induced shear, via a resolvent framework. Langmuir turbulence is characterised by multiscale vortical structures, notably counter-rotating roll pairs known as Langmuir circulations. While classic linear stability analyses of the Craik-Leibovich equations have revealed key instability mechanisms underlying Langmuir circulations, the vortical rolls characteristic of Langmuir turbulence, the present work incorporates the turbulent mean state and varying eddy viscosity using data from large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulence dynamics of fully developed Langmuir turbulence. Scale-dependent resolvent analyses reveal a new formation mechanism of two-dimensional circulating rolls and three-dimensional turbulent coherent vortices through linear amplification of sustained harmonic forcing. Moreover, the integrated energy spectra predicted by the principal resolvent modes in response to broadband harmonic forcing capture the dominant spanwise length scales that are consistent with the LES data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of resolvent analyses in capturing key features of multiscale turbulence-wave interactions in the statistical stationary state of Langmuir turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in Navier-Stokes models. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Extending the trapping theorem to provide local stability guarantees for quadratically nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>
