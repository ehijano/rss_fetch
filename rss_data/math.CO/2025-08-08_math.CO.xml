      <title>Recurrence Relations for Some Integer Sequences Related to Ward Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give recurrence relations and identities for some integer sequences related to Ward numbers such as Ward-Lah numbers, varied Ward numbers and binomial Ward numbers. Most of the sequences are entered in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. We give triangular recurrence relations, horizontal recurrence relations, exponential generating functions and some recurrence relations of higher order obtained by using Sister Celine's general algorithm.</description>

      <title>Chain characteristic polynomials of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we introduce a family of polynomials on a matroid derived from chain Tutte polynomials which generalize the classic and ubiquitous characteristic polynomial. We show that the coefficients of these polynomials alternate and present a recursion for any matroid. The classic characteristic polynomials were motivated by the chromatic polynomial on graphs. We define a generalized proper vertex coloring on a graph, which we call coupled multicoloring. We also define a generalized nowhere zero flow, which we call coupled multicommodity flow. Then we show that these chain characteristic polynomials enumerate the number of coupled multicolorings and coupled multicommodity flows on a graph. We conclude by listing multiple problems on enumerative properties of chain characteristic polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a direct application of Dilworth truncations of polymatroids, we give short proofs of two theorems: Bernstein's characterisation of algebraic matroids coming from the Hadamard product of two linear spaces, and a formula for the dimension of the amoeba of a complex linear space by Draisma, Eggleston, Pendavingh, Rau, and Yuen. We disprove Bernstein's conjecture on a characterisation of the algebraic matroids of Hadamard products of more than two linear spaces, by giving explicit counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Balanced Steinhaus triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C. Molluzzo in 1978, that has remained unsolved to date for the even values of $m\geqslant 12$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'{a}n problem for $\mathcal{{K}}_{3,3}^{-}$-free signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical spectral Tur\'{a}n problem is to determine the maximum spectral radius of an $\mathcal{F}$-free graph of order $n$. Zhai and Wang [Linear Algebra Appl, 437 (2012) 1641-1647] determined the maximum spectral radius of ${C}_{4}$-free graphs of given order. Additionally, Nikiforov obtained spectral strengthenings of the K\H{o}vari-S\'{o}s-Tur\'{a}n theorem [Linear Algebra Appl, 432 (2010) 1405-1411] when the forbidden graphs are complete bipartite. The spectral Tur\'{a}n problem concerning forbidden complete bipartite graphs in signed graphs has also attracted considerable attention. Let $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}^-$ be the set of all unbalanced signed graphs with underlying graphs $K_{s,t}$. Since the cases where $s=1$ or $t=1$ do not conform to the definition of $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}^-$, it follows that $s,t\geq 2$. Wang and Lin [Discrete Appl. Math, 372 (2025) 164-172] have solved the case of $s=t=2$ since $\mathcal{K}_{2,2}^-$ is $\mathcal{C}_{4}^{-}$ in this situation. This paper gives an answer for $s=t=3$ and completely characterizes the corresponding extremal signed graphs.</description>

      <title>On Relative Ordered Tur\'an Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ordered graph $F$, denote the Tur\'an density by $\vec{\pi}(F)$. The relative Tur\'an density, denoted by $\rho(F)$, is the supremum over $\alpha \in [0,1]$ such that every ordered graph $G$ contains an $F$-free subgraph $G'$ with $e(G') \geq \alpha e(G)$. Reiher, R\"odl, Sales and Schacht showed that $\rho(P) = \vec{\pi}(P)/2$ and $\rho(K) = \vec{\pi}(K)$ for any ascending path $P$ or clique $K$. They asked if there are any ordered graphs $F$ with $\vec{\pi}(F)/2 &lt; \rho(F) &lt; \vec{\pi}(F)$. We answer this question in the affirmative by describing a family of such $F$. We also determine the relative Tur\'an densities of some small ordered matchings, showing that $\rho\left(\{\{1,6\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\}\}\right)=0$ and $\rho\left(\{\{1,3\}, \{2,5\}, \{4,6\}\}\right)=0$.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bounds on the maximum size of graphs with girth 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for improving lower bounds on $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$, the maximum size (number of edges) of an $n$-vertex graph of girth at least 5. The core of our algorithm is a variant of a hill-climbing heuristic introduced by Exoo, McKay, Myrvold and Nadon (2011) to find small cages. Our algorithm considers a range of values of $n$ in multiple passes. In each pass, the hill-climbing heuristic for a specific value of $n$ is initialized with a few graphs obtained by modifying near-extremal graphs previously found for neighboring values of $n$, allowing to `propagate' good patterns that were found. Focusing on the range $n\in \{74,75, \dots, 198\}$, which is currently beyond the scope of exact methods, our approach yields improvements on existing lower bounds for $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$ for all $n$ in the range, except for two values of $n$ ($n=96,97$).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically-tight packing and covering with transversal bases in Rota's basis conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1989, Rota conjectured that, given any $n$ bases $B_1,\dots,B_n$ of a vector space of dimension $n$, or more generally a matroid of rank $n$, it is possible to rearrange these into $n$ disjoint transversal bases. Here, a transversal basis is a basis consisting of exactly one element from each of the original bases $B_1,\dots,B_n$. Two natural approaches to this conjecture are, to ask in this setting a) how many disjoint transversal bases can we find and b) how few transversal bases do we need to cover all the elements of $B_1,\dots,B_n$? In this paper, we give asymptotically-tight answers to both of these questions.
  For a), we show that there are always $(1-o(1))n$ disjoint transversal bases, improving a result of Buci\'c, Kwan, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov that $(1/2-o(1))n$ disjoint transversal bases always exist. For b), we show that $B_1\cup\dots \cup B_n$ can be covered by $(1+o(1))n$ transversal bases, improving a result of Aharoni and Berger using instead $2n$ transversal bases, and a subsequent result of the Polymath project on Rota's basis conjecture using $2n-2$ transversal bases.</description>

      <title>Liftable braids and the coloured braid groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When $\pi:\widetilde{\Sigma}\rightarrow D^2$ is a cover of the disc branched over $n$ marked points, the braid group $B_n$ acts on the disc by homeomorphisms fixing the marked points setwise. A braid $\beta$ \textit{lifts} if there is a homeomorphism $\widetilde{\beta}\in \textit{Mod}(\widetilde{\Sigma})$ such that $\beta\circ \pi=\pi\circ \widetilde{\beta}$. For arbitrary covers, the \textit{lifting homomorphism} taking $\beta$ to $\widetilde{\beta}$ is only defined on a proper subgroup of the braid group. This paper extends the lifting homomorphism to a map from a coloured braid groupoid to a mapping class groupoid for all simple covers of the disc. We characterise the lift of every coloured braid, recovering the classical lifting homomorphism on the liftable braid group.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of isometric path partition: treewidth and diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph, arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them, require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story of parameterization by treewidth.
  In this paper, we prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time. This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high, as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless the Randomized-ETH fails.</description>

      <title>Rings as unions of proper ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define and investigate $\textit{ideal covering numbers}$ of associative rings (not assumed to be commutative or unital): three invariants defined as the minimal number of proper left, right, or two-sided ideals whose union equals the ring. For every prime $p$, we construct four infinite families of rings without identity that attain the sharp lower bound $p + 1$ for ideal covering numbers, each exhibiting distinct behavior with respect to left, right, and two-sided ideal coverings. As a consequence of a result by Lucchini and Mar\'{o}ti, we also characterize all rings with ideal covering numbers three. Finally, we make several observations and propose open questions related to these invariants and the structure of rings admitting such ideal coverings.</description>

      <title>From arcs to curves: quadratic growth of 1-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the largest size of a collection of simple closed curves pairwise intersecting at most once on an orientable surface of Euler characteristic $\chi$ grows quadratically in $|\chi|$. This resolves a longstanding question of Farb-Leininger, up to multiplicative constants. Inspired by the work of Przytycki in the setting of arcs, we introduce the concepts of \textit{almost nibs}, \textit{flowers}, and \textit{stem systems} in order to account for how certain polygons built from pairs of curves in the collection distribute their area over the surface.</description>

      <title>NP-Hardness and ETH-Based Inapproximability of Communication Complexity via Relaxed Interlacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that computing the deterministic communication complexity D(f) of a Boolean function is NP-hard, even when protocols are limited to a constant number of alternations, resolving a question first posed by Yao (1979). Our reduction builds and expands on a suite of structural "interlacing" lemmas introduced by Mackenzie and Saffidine (arXiv:2505.12345); these lemmas can be reused as black boxes in future lower-bound constructions.
  The instances produced by our reduction admit optimal protocols that use only constant alternations, so NP-hardness holds under stronger restrictions than those considered in concurrent and independent work by Hirahara, Ilango, and Loff (arXiv:2507.06789), whose proof requires unbounded alternations.
  Because the gadgets in our construction are self-similar, they can be recursively embedded. We sketch how this yields, under the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, an additive inapproximability gap that grows without bound, and we outline a route toward NP-hardness of approximating D(f) within a fixed constant additive error. Full details of the ETH-based inapproximability results will appear in a future version.
  Beyond settling the complexity of deterministic communication complexity itself, the modular framework we develop opens the door to a wider class of reductions and, we believe, will prove useful in tackling other long-standing questions in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Generating graphs randomly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs are used in many disciplines to model the relationships that exist between objects in a complex discrete system. Researchers may wish to compare a network of interest to a "typical" graph from a family (or ensemble) of graphs which are similar in some way. One way to do this is to take a sample of several random graphs from the family, to gather information about what is "typical". Hence there is a need for algorithms which can generate graphs uniformly (or approximately uniformly) at random from the given family. Since a large sample may be required, the algorithm should also be computationally efficient.
  Rigorous analysis of such algorithms is often challenging, involving both combinatorial and probabilistic arguments. We will focus mainly on the set of all simple graphs with a particular degree sequence, and describe several different algorithms for sampling graphs from this family uniformly, or almost uniformly.</description>

      <title>The weak acyclic matching property in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A\subset\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another subset $B\subset\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a bijection $f : A \rightarrow B$ with the property that $a+f(a)$ never lies in $A$. A matching is called acyclic if it is uniquely determined by its multiplicity function. Alon et al. established the acyclic matching property for $\mathbb{Z}^n$, which was later extended to all abelian torsion-free groups. In a prior work, the authors of this paper settled the acyclic matching property for all abelian groups. The objective of this note is to explore a related concept, known as the weak acyclic matching property, within the context of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A note on the multicolor size-Ramsey numbers of connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-color size-Ramsey number of a graph $H$, denoted by $\widehat{R}_r(H)$, is the minimum number of edges in a graph $G$ having the property that every $r$-coloring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$.
  Krivelevich proved that $\widehat{R}_r(P_{m+1})=\Omega(r^2m)$ where $P_{m+1}$ is the path on $m$ edges. He explains that his proof actually applies to any connected graph $H$ with $m$ edges and vertex cover number larger than $\sqrt{m}$. He also notes that some restriction on the vertex cover number is necessary since the star with $m$ edges, $K_{1,m}$, has vertex cover number 1 and satisfies $\widehat{R}_r(K_{1,m})=r(m-1)+1$. We prove that the star is actually the only exception; that is, $\widehat{R}_r(H)=\Omega(r^2m)$ for every non-star connected graph $H$ with $m$ edges.
  We also prove a strengthening of this result for trees. It follows from results of Beck and Dellamonica that $\widehat{R}_2(T)=\Theta(\beta(T))$ for every tree $T$ with bipartition $\{V_1, V_2\}$ and $\beta(T)=|V_1|\max\{d(v):v\in V_1\}+|V_2|\max\{d(v):v\in V_2\}$. We prove that $\widehat{R}_r(T)=\Omega(r^2\beta(T))$ for every tree $T$, again with the exception of the star. Additionally, we prove that for the family of non-star trees $T$ with $\beta(T)=\Omega(n_1n_2)$ (which includes all non-star trees of linear maximum degree and all trees of radius 2 for example) we have $\widehat{R}_r(T)=\Theta(r^2\beta(T))$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on quadratic unitary Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$ has vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n: =\{0,1, \ldots ,n-1\}$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if and only if $u - v$ or $v-u$ is a square of some units in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. This paper explores the periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. We determine all periodic quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. From our results, it follows that there are infinitely many integral as well as non-integral graphs that are periodic. Additionally, we also determine the values of $n$ for which the quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$ exhibits perfect state transfer.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>On an acyclic relaxation of incomparable families of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two families $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}([k])$, we write $\mathcal{A}\vdash\mathcal{B}$ if $A\not\supseteq B$ for each two sets $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$. $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are called incomparable if $\mathcal{A}\vdash\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}\vdash\mathcal{A}$. Seymour proved that the maximum size of two incomparable equal-sized families in $\mathcal{P}([k])$ is $\frac{1}{4}2^k$.
  A sequence of families $\mathcal{B}_1,\dots,\mathcal{B}_l \ \subseteq \mathcal{P}([k])$ is called $d$-exceeding if $\mathcal{B}_i\vdash\mathcal{B}_j$ for all $i,j\in [l]$ with $j-i\in [d]$. Cyclically reusing $d+1$ pairwise incomparable families yields arbitrarily long $d$-exceeding sequences of families. We prove inversely that the maximum size of equal-sized families of a sufficiently long $1$-exceeding sequence in $\mathcal{P}([k])$ is also $\frac{1}{4}2^k$.
  A sequence of sets $B_1,\dots,B_l \subseteq [k]$ is called $d$-exceeding if $\{B_1\},\dots,\{B_l\}$ is $d$-exceeding, that is, if $B_i \not\supseteq B_j$ for all $i,j\in [l]$ with $j-i\in [d]$. We locate the maximum $d$ such that there exist arbitrarily long $d$-exceeding sequences of subsets of $[k]$ between $(1-o(1)) \tfrac{1}{e} 2^k$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}2^k-2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of homogeneous quadratics: Current trends and challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we partition the integers into finitely many cells. Can we always find a solution of the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$ with $x,y,z$ on the same cell? What about more general homogeneous quadratic equations in three variables? These are basic questions in arithmetic Ramsey theory, which have recently been partially answered using ideas inspired by ergodic theory and tools such as Gowers-uniformity properties and concentration estimates of bounded multiplicative functions. The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to this exciting research area, explaining the main ideas behind the recent progress and some of the important challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Matchings in matroids over abelian groups, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04516v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of matchings originated in group theory to address a linear algebra problem related to canonical forms for symmetric tensors. In an abelian group $(G,+)$, a matching is a bijection $f: A \to B$ between two finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ such that $a + f(a) \notin A$ for all $a \in A$. A group $G$ has the matching property if, for every two finite subsets $A, B \subset G$ of the same size with $0 \notin B$, there exists a matching from $A$ to $B$. In prior work [5], matroid analogues of results concerning matchings in groups were introduced and established. This paper serves as a sequel, extending that line of inquiry by investigating sparse paving, panhandle, and Schubert matroids through the lens of matchability. While some proofs draw upon earlier findings on the matchability of sparse paving matroids, the paper is designed to be self-contained and accessible without reference to the preceding sequel. Our approach combines tools from both matroid theory and additive number theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show the following results: (i) If $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and the bound is tight for each $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. (ii) If $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)= 4$, then $\chi(G)= 4$. These results extend the chromatic bounds known for the class of ($P_2+P_2$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs and for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improve the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524 [math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answer a question of Ju and the third author [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}=\{G_1,\ldots, G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\}$ be a set of graphs on the same vertex set $V=\{1,\dots,n\}$ where $k\cdot n$ is even. We say $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor if there exists a $k$-regular graph $F$ on the vertex set $V$ such that all edges of $F$ are from different members of $\mathcal{G}$. In this paper, we show a sufficient spectral condition for the existence of a rainbow $k$-factor for $k\geq 2$, which is that if $\rho(G_i)\geq\rho(K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k}))$ for each $G_i\in \mathcal{G}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor unless $G_1=G_2=\cdots=G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\cong K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k})$.</description>

      <title>New upper and lower bounds on the smallest singular values of nonsingular lower triangular $(0,1)$-matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K_n$ denote the set of all nonsingular $n\times n$ lower triangular $(0,1)$-matrices. Hong and Loewy (2004) introduced the number sequence $$ c_n=\min\{\lambda\mid\lambda~\text{is an eigenvalue of}~XX^{\rm T},~X\in K_n\},\quad n\in\mathbb Z_+. $$ There have been a number of attempts in the literature to obtain bounds on the numbers $c_n$ by Mattila (2015), Altinisik et al. (2016), Kaarnioja (2021), Loewy (2021), and Altinisik (2021). In this paper, improved upper and lower bounds are derived for the numbers $c_n$. By considering the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix $Z_n$ satisfying $c_n=\|Z_n\|_2^{-1}$, it is shown that the second largest eigenvalue of $Z_n$ is bounded from above by $\frac45$ leading to an improved upper bound on $c_n$. On the other hand, Samuelson's inequality applied to the roots of the characteristic polynomial of $Z_n$ yields an improved lower bound. Numerical experiments demonstrate the quality of the new bounds.</description>

We also show that for every $k\geq 6$, there exists some constant $C(k)$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex $5$-connected planar graph has at most $C(k) \cdot n^{\lfloor{k/3}\rfloor}$ many cycles of length $k$. This upper bound is asymptotically tight for all $k\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the seminal work of Andr\'e-Louis Cholesky -- whose contributions remain crucial in broader sciences even after more than a century -- Cooper, Hanna and Whitlatch (2024) developed a theory of positive matrices over finite fields, and Khare and Vishwakarma (2025) described a general Cholesky factorization for a dense sub-family of the cone of Hermitian matrices over real/complex fields, whose leading principal minors (LPM) are nonzero. Building on this, we develop a parallel theory within the finite field setting. Specifically $(i)$ we extend the general Cholesky factorization to the LPM cone over finite fields which has asymptotic density $1$. We show that $(ii)$ this factorization is compatible with the entrywise Frobenius map, recently studied in the context of positivity preservers by Guillot, Gupta, Vishwakarma, and Yip [J. Algebra, 2025]. We also $(iii)$ leverage the Cholesky-structures to define meaningful group operations on the matrix cone, and as an application $(iv)$ enumerate sub-cones of LPM matrices using our general Cholesky factorizations.</description>

      <title>Watson-Crick conjugates of words and languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03123v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the concept of Watson-Crick conjugates, also known as $\theta$-conjugates (where $\theta$ is an antimorphic involution), of words and languages. This concept extends the classical idea of conjugates by incorporating the Watson-Crick complementarity of DNA sequences. Our investigation initially focuses on the properties of $\theta$-conjugates of words. We then define $\theta$-conjugates of a language and study closure properties of certain families of languages under the $\theta$-conjugate operation. Furthermore, we analyze the iterated $\theta$-conjugate of both words and languages. Finally, we discuss the idea of $\theta$-conjugate-free languages and examine some decidability problems related to it.</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$ and the graph $K_4-e$ is commonly referred as the {\em diamond}. This partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theoretical Computer Science 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] and is related to a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished). Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>

      <title>Computing the probability of intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $i$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>
