      <title>Weak Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets from Alternating $g$-Tensor Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are magnetic materials with antiferromagnetic spin ordering but exhibit ferromagnetic properties. Understanding the microscopic origin of the latter is a central problem. Ferromagnet-like properties such as the anomalous Hall effect are linked with weak ferromagnetism, whose microscopic origin in altermagnets remains unclear however. We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets and explain various properties of the weak ferromagnetism in altermagnets. Our findings provide insights for characterizing and manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of 2DEG states in shallow Si:Sb $\delta$-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of high-density layers of Sb dopants in a silicon host, so-called Si:Sb $\delta$-layers. We show that, in spite of the known challenges in producing highly confined Sb $\delta$-layers, sufficient confinement is created such that the lowest conduction band states ($\Gamma$ states, studied in depth in other silicon $\delta$-layers), become occupied and can be observed using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The electronic structure of the Si:Sb $\delta$-layers closely resembles that of Si:P systems, where the observed conduction band is near-parabolic and slightly anisotropic in the $\mathbf{k}_\parallel$ plane. The observed $\Gamma$ state extends ~ 1 nm in the out-of-plane direction, which is slightly wider than the 1/3 monolayer thick dopant distribution. This is caused by a small segregation of the dopant layer, which is nevertheless minimal when comparing with earlier published attempts. Our results serve to demonstrate that Sb is still a feasible dopant alternative for use in the semiconductor $\delta$-layer platform, providing similar electronic functionality to Si:P systems. Additionally, it has the advantages of being less expensive, more controllable, safer to handle, and more compatible with industrial patterning techniques. Si:Sb is therefore a viable platform for emerging quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time experiment-theory closed-loop interaction for autonomous materials science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative cycles of theoretical prediction and experimental validation are the cornerstone of the modern scientific method. However, the proverbial "closing of the loop" in experiment-theory cycles in practice are usually ad hoc, often inherently difficult, or impractical to repeat on a systematic basis, beset by the scale or the time constraint of computation or the phenomena under study. Here, we demonstrate Autonomous MAterials Search Engine (AMASE), where we enlist robot science to perform self-driving continuous cyclical interaction of experiments and computational predictions for materials exploration. In particular, we have applied the AMASE formalism to the rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram, a fundamental task for the search and discovery of new materials. Thermal processing and experimental determination of compositional phase boundaries in thin films are autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of the phase diagram prediction through the minimization of Gibbs free energies. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi binary thin-film system on the fly from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the entire composition - temperature phase space, translating to a 6-fold reduction in the number of necessary experiments. This study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of real-time, autonomous, and iterative interactions of experiments and theory carried out without any human intervention.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Machine Learning Analysis of X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectra and Pair Distribution Functions: Performance and Interpretability towards Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used off-the-shelf interpretable ML techniques to combine information from multiple heterogeneous spectra: X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs), to extract information about local structure and chemistry of transition metal oxides. This approach enabled us to analyze the relative contributions of the different spectra to different prediction tasks. Specifically, we trained random forest models on XANES, PDF, and both of them combined, to extract charge (oxidation) state, coordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length of transition metal cations in oxides. We find that XANES-only models tend to outperform the PDF-only models for all the tasks, and information from XANES often dominated when the two inputs were combined. This was even true for structural tasks where we might expect PDF to dominate. However, the performance gap closes when we used species-specific differential PDFs (dPDFs) as the inputs instead of total PDFs. Our results highlight that XANES contains rich structural information and may be further developed as a structural probe. Our interpretable, multimodal approach is quick and easy to implement when suitable structural and spectroscopic databases are available. This approach provides valuable insights into the relative strengths of different modalities for a practical scientific goal, guiding researchers in their experiment design tasks such as deciding when it is useful to combine complementary techniques in a scientific investigation.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Nanotubes form Chemical Cleavage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Divergent Evolution of Slip Banding in Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic materials under high stress often exhibit deformation localization, manifesting as slip banding. Over seven decades ago, Frank and Read introduced the well-known model of dislocation multiplication at a source, explaining slip band formation. Here, we reveal two distinct types of slip bands (confined and extended) in alloys through multi-scale testing and modeling from microscopic to atomic scales. The confined slip band, characterized by a thin glide zone, arises from the conventional process of repetitive full dislocation emissions at Frank-Read source. Contrary to the classical model, the extended band stems from slip-induced deactivation of dislocation sources, followed by consequent generation of new sources on adjacent planes, leading to rapid band thickening. Our findings provide critical insights into atomic-scale collective dislocation motion and microscopic deformation instability in advanced structural materials, marking a pivotal advancement in our fundamental understanding of deformation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring structure diversity in atomic resolution microscopy with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high-throughput analysis of atomic-resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, we describe a few-shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.), showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image-driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic-scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self-assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub-models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.</description>

      <title>Multiscale approach for modeling magnetization properties of inhomogeneous ultrathin magnetic layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on spin atomistic calculations used to model static and dynamic magnetic properties of inhomogeneous ultrathin iron films. Active magnetic layers in next-generation spintronic devices are becoming so thin that they exhibit some variable degree of roughness at the low-scale making them magnetically inhomogeneous. We propose a multiscale approach to progressively shift from a rough atomic-scale system to an ensemble of macrospins. By studying nanoscale islands of atoms in contact with each other, we demonstrate that ultrathin rough layers can be described by a set of macrospins coupled by a Heisenberg-like exchange interaction driven by the existence and shape of nanoconstrictions linking the islands. We show that the magnetization dynamics at 0 K is strongly impacted by this surface morphology since the resonant frequency of a typical ultrathin iron layer can drop by up to an order of magnitude due to inhomogeneities. Additionally, we used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic and spin reorientation transition temperatures for various morphology parameters and we show how nanoconstrictions and shapes of the atomic clusters can modify these transition temperatures. Our results demonstrate the possibility to account for the morphology of ultrathin structures with significant roughness. We believe that our approach makes it possible to model complete devices as close as possible to experimental reality.</description>

      <title>Wannier interpolation of reciprocal-space periodic and non-periodic matrix elements in the optimally smooth subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximally localized Wannier functions use the gauge freedom of Bloch wavefunctions to define the optimally smooth subspace with matrix elements that depend smoothly on crystal momentum. The associated Wannier functions are real-space localized, a feature often used to Fourier interpolate periodic observables in reciprocal space on ultradense momentum grids. However, Fourier interpolation cannot handle non-periodic quantities in reciprocal space, such as the oscillator strength matrix elements, which are crucial for the evaluation of optical properties. We show that a direct multidimensional interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace yields comparable accuracy with respect to Fourier interpolation at a similar or lower computational cost. This approach can also interpolate and extrapolate non-periodic observables, enabling the calculation of optical properties on ultradense momentum grids. Finally, we underline that direct interpolation in the optimally smooth subspace can be employed for periodic and non-periodic tensors of any order without any information on the position of the Wannier centers in real space.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge conversion in orthorhombic RhSi topological semimetal crystalline thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Strain-modulated Valley Polarization and Piezomagnetic Effects in Altermagnetic Cr$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism exhibits advantages over both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts by enabling spin splitting within antiferromagnetic materials. Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin-orbit coupling and spin. Here, using Cr$_2$S$_2$ as a case study, we investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from the external field's disruption of diagonal mirror symmetry $M_{xy}$, consequently inducing valley polarization within the material. Strain not only induces valley polarization but also generates an almost uniform magnetic field, which can reach as high as 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. In addition, this symmetry breaking in Cr$_2$S$_2$ monolayers results in significant piezomagnetic properties, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Transverse thermoelectric conversion in the mixed-dimensional semimetal WSi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with axis-dependent conduction polarity are known as $p\times n$-type or goniopolar conductors that can be used for transverse thermoelectric devices, allowing the longitudinal thermal current to be converted into the transverse electrical current. Here, we performed experimental and computational studies on the transport properties of WSi$_2$ single crystals, in which such axis-dependent conduction polarity of the thermopower and the Hall coefficient have recently been reported, and demonstrated the transverse thermoelectric effect by applying the temperature gradient in a 45$^{\circ}$ rotated direction from the crystallographic axis. We have observed strongly sample-dependent transport properties, which have also been observed in previous studies, and together with first-principles calculations we show that such sample-dependent transport properties originate from the band-dependent scattering rates of carriers. The calculated band-resolved Peltier conductivity shows that the mixed-dimensional electronic structure consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional electron Fermi surface and a quasi-two-dimensional hole surface is a key property for the axis-dependent conduction polarity. The directly obtained transverse thermoelectric figure of merit is comparable to that of the anomalous Nernst materials, implying that the present material is a potential candidate for transverse thermoelectric conversion.</description>

      <title>Transition from antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism: symmetry breaking theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently proposed magnetic phase, is distinguished by the antiferromagnetic coupling of local magnetic moments and the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Currently, the transition from conventional antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism is not well understood. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive symmetry-breaking theory to elucidate this transition. Our approach involves analyzing magnetic point groups and their subgroups to identify potential pathways for the phase transition from collinear antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism. According to our theory, breaking inversion symmetry is crucial for this transition. We discovered that applying an external electric field is a highly effective method to realize altermagnetic phase, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations on the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic material MoTe. Furthermore, we show that the electronic spin polarization and spin-dependent transport can be significantly modulated by the applied vertical electric field. Our study not only sheds light on the magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetic to altermagnetic materials but also presents a practical approach to control the charge-spin conversion ratio using an vertical electric field.</description>

Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the archetypal BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe for the first time the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bonding network. We use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window neutron scattering studies in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>In silico design and prediction of metastable quaternary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternary phases formed in copper alloys are investigated through a combination of quantum-mechanical and classical computer simulations and active machine learning. Focus is given on nickel, silicon, and chromium impurities in a copper matrix. The analysis of the formation enthalpies of candidate quaternary structures leads to the prediction of two novel quaternary phases and the assessment of their stability. For the predicted two phases, machine learned atomistic potentials are developed using active learning with a quantum-mechanical accuracy. Use of these potentials in atomistic simulations further elucidates the structure, temperature-dependent dynamics, and elastic behavior of the predicted quaternary phases in copper alloys. The combined in silico approach is thus proven highly efficient in both designing materials and elucidating their properties and potential combining different spatiotemporal scales. In the case of alloys, this computational scheme significantly reduces the effort in searching the huge chemical space of possible phases, enhancing the efficiency in synthesizing novel alloys with pre-defined properties.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall and Edelstein Effects in Novel Chiral Noncollinear Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly discovered class of magnetic phases that combine the spin polarization behavior of ferromagnetic band structures with the vanishing net magnetization characteristic of antiferromagnets. Initially proposed for collinear magnets, the concept has since been extended to include certain non-collinear structures. A recent development in Landau theory for collinear altermagnets incorporates spin-space symmetries, providing a robust framework for identifying this class of materials. Here we expand on that theory to identify altermagnetic multipolar order parameters in non-collinear chiral materials. We demonstrate that the interplay between non-collinear altermagnetism and chirality allows for spatially odd multipole components, leading to non-trivial spin textures on Fermi surfaces and unexpected transport phenomena, even in the absence of SOC. This makes such chiral altermagnets fundamentally different from the well-known SOC-driven Rashba-Edelstein and spin Hall effects used for 2D spintronics. Choosing the chiral topological magnetic material Mn$_3$IrSi as a case study, we apply toy models and first-principles calculations to predict experimental signatures, such as large spin-Hall and Edelstein effects, that have not been previously observed in altermagnets. These findings pave the way for a new realm of spintronics applications based on spin-transport properties of chiral altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Non-linear anomalous Edelstein response at altermagnetic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an anomalous transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Moreover the non-linear Edelstein response resulting purely from electric fields also triggers the anomalous out-of-plane magnetization. We determine the anomalous response with a model based on the ab-initio electronic structure of RuO$_2$ bilayers, ultimately opening experimental avenues to explore spin-charge conversion phenomena at altermagnetic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Disordered charge density waves in the kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has prompted interest in the interplay between kagome physics, CDW, and magnetism. However, a crucial aspect for understanding these emergent phenomena-the precise CDW structure-remains ambiguous. Recent studies have assumed uniformly distributed Ge dimers, but this assumption is problematic. The predicted band structure based on this model exhibits an abrupt disappearance of a Ge-$p$ band in the Fermi surface, contradicting experimental observations from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In this study, we propose that a CDW phase with disordered Ge dimers can reconcile theoretical predictions with ARPES results. This model reproduces the observed CDW gaps while preserving the Ge-$p$ band. Depending on experimental conditions, Ge dimers can be randomly distributed or exhibit phase separation from pristine regions. Our findings reveal the crucial role of Ge dimer disorder in the FeGe CDW and suggest potential implications of this disorder for other properties, such as magnetism and transport, in this system.</description>

      <title>MOFFlow: Flow Matching for Structure Prediction of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials with promising applications in many areas such as carbon capture and drug delivery. In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction. Existing approaches, including ab initio calculations and even deep generative models, struggle with the complexity of MOF structures due to the large number of atoms in the unit cells. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</description>

      <title>Telecom-wavelength Single-photon Emitters in Multi-layer InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust and efficient single photon emitters (SPEs) at telecom wavelengths is critical for advancements in quantum information science. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently emerged as promising sources for SPEs, owing to their high photon extraction efficiency, facile coupling to external fields, and seamless integration into photonic circuits. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of SPEs emitting in the 1000 to 1550 nm near-infrared range by coupling 2D indium selenide (InSe) with strain-inducing nanopillar arrays. The emission wavelength exhibits a strong dependence on the number of layers. Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiments conducted at 10 K reveal clear photon antibunching, confirming the single-photon nature of the emissions. Density-functional-theory calculations and scanning-tunneling-microscopy analyses provide insights into the electronic structures and defect states, elucidating the origins of the SPEs. Our findings highlight the potential of multilayer 2D metal monochalcogenides for creating SPEs across a broad spectral range, paving the way for their integration into quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>New geometric receipts for design of photonic crystals and metamaterials: optimal toric packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of photonic crystals having large bandgaps above a prescribed band is a well-known physical problem with many applications. A connection to an interesting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had been conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1 correspond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the generators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse electric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another mathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of discs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively different from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several times. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with remarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern solid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally packed discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi tessellations.</description>

      <title>Experimental Pathways for Detecting Double Superionicity in Planetary Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are assumed to contain large amounts of planetary ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The properties of mixtures of such ices at the extreme pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors are not yet well understood. Ab initio computer simulations predicted that a number of ices exhibit a hydrogen superionic state and a doubly superionic state [DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-42958-0]. Since the latter state has not yet been generated with experiments, we outline here two possible pathways for reaching and detecting such a state with dynamic compression experiments. We suggest X-ray diffraction as the principal tool for detecting when the material becomes doubly superionic and the sublattice of one of the heavy nuclei melts. That would require a temperature of $\sim$3500 K and pressures greater than $\sim$200 GPa for H$_3$NO$_4$, which we use as an example material here. Such conditions can be reached with experiments that employ an initial shock that is followed by a ramp compression wave. Alternatively, one may use triple-shock compression because a single shock does not yield sufficiently high densities.</description>

      <title>Undulation-induced moir\'e superlattices with 1D polarization domains and 1D flat bands in 2D bilayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a high F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an number and can be easily bent, much like a paper, making undulations a novel way to design distinct electronic phases. Through first-principles calculations, we reveal the formation of 1D polarization domains and 1D flat electronic bands by 1D bending modulation to a 2D bilayer semiconductor. Using 1D sinusoidal undulation of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer as an example, we demonstrate how undulation induces nonuniform shear patterns, creating regions with unique local stacking and vertical polarization akin to sliding-induced ferroelectrics observed in twisted moir\'e systems. This sliding-induced polarization is also observed in double-wall BN nanotubes due to curvature differences between inner and outer tubes. Furthermore, undulation generates a shear-induced 1D moir\'e pattern that perturbs electronic states, confining them into 1D quantum-well-like bands with kinetic energy quenched in modulation direction while dispersive in other directions (1D flat bands). This electronic confinement is attributed to modulated shear deformation potential resulting from tangential polarization due to the moir\'e pattern. Thus, bending modulation and interlayer shear offer an alternative avenue, termed "curvytronics", to induce exotic phenomena in 2D bilayer materials.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Chalcogenides: An Inspiring Playground For Exploring Frustrated Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare-earth chalcogenide $ARECh_{2}$ family ($A =$ alkali metal or monovalent ions, $RE =$ rare earth, $Ch =$ chalcogen) has emerged as a paradigmatic platform for studying frustrated magnetism on a triangular lattice. The family members exhibit a variety of ground states, from quantum spin liquid to exotic ordered phases, providing fascinating insight into quantum magnetism. Their simple crystal structure and chemical tunability enable systematic exploration of competing interactions in quantum magnets. Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic studies have revealed rich phase diagrams and unusual excitations, refining theoretical models of frustrated systems. This review provides a succinct introduction to $ARECh_{2}$ research. It summarizes key findings on crystal structures, single-ion physics, magnetic Hamiltonians, ground states, and low-energy excitations. By highlighting current developments and open questions, we aim to catalyze further exploration and deeper physical understanding on this frontier of quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>High resistance of superconducting TiN thin films against environmental attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors, an essential class of functional materials, hold a vital position in both fundamental science and practical applications. However, most superconductors, including MgB$_2$, Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, and FeSe, are highly sensitive to environmental attacks (such as water and moist air), hindering their wide applications. More importantly, the surface physical and chemical processes of most superconductors in various environments remain poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively investigate the high resistance of superconducting titanium nitride (TiN) epitaxial films against acid and alkali attacks. Unexpectedly, despite immersion in acid and alkaline solutions for over 7 days, the crystal structure and superconducting properties of TiN films remain stable, as demonstrated by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, electrical transport, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscope. Furthermore, combining scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis with density functional theory calculations revealed the corrosion mechanisms: acid corrosions lead to the creation of numerous defects due to the substitution of Cl ions for N anions, whereas alkaline environments significantly reduce the film thickness through the stabilization of OH$^\ast$ adsorbates. Our results uncover the unexpected stability and durability of superconducting materials against environmental attacks, highlighting their potential for enhanced reliability and longevity in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Mystery of superconductivity in FeTe films and the role of neighboring layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in the Fe(Te,Se) system, it has been a general consensus that the end member of FeTe is not superconducting. Nonetheless, in recent years, there have been reports of superconducting FeTe films, but the origin of their superconductivity remains mysterious. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review of all the reported FeTe films regarding the relationship between their superconductivity and neighboring layers. Based on this review, we show that telluride neighboring layers are the key to superconducting FeTe films. Then, with additional new studies, we show that stoichiometric Te content, which can be readily achieved in FeTe films with the assistance of neighboring telluride layers, might be crucial to stabilizing the superconductivity in this system. This work provides insights into the underlying mechanism behind superconductivity in FeTe films and sheds light on the critical role of neighboring layers and stoichiometry control toward manipulating topological superconductivity in FeTe heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Why does the $GW$ approximation give accurate quasiparticle energies? The cancellation of vertex corrections quantified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedin's $GW$ approximation to the electronic self-energy has been impressively successful to calculate quasiparticle energies, such as ionization potentials, electron affinities, or electronic band structures. The success of this fairly simple approximation has been ascribed to the cancellation of the so-called vertex corrections that go beyond $GW$. This claim is mostly based on past calculations using vertex corrections within the crude local-density approximation. In this study, we explore a wide variety of non-local vertex corrections in the polarizability and the self-energy, using first-order approximations or infinite summations to all orders. In particular, we use vertices based on statically screened interactions like in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We demonstrate on realistic molecular systems that indeed the two vertices in Hedin's equation essentially compensate. We further show that the consistency between the two vertices is crucial to obtain realistic electronic properties. We finally consider increasingly large clusters and extrapolate that our conclusions would hold for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Positive oscillating magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In all van der Waals layered antiferromagnetic semiconductors investigated so far a negative magnetoresistance has been observed in vertical transport measurements, with characteristic trends that do not depend on applied bias. Here we report vertical transport measurements on layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ that exhibit a drastically different behavior, namely a strongly bias dependent, positive magnetoresistance that is accompanied by pronounced oscillations for devices whose thickness is smaller than 10 nm. We establish that this unexpected behavior originates from transport being space-charge limited, and not injection limited as for layered antiferromagetic semiconductors studid earlier. Our analysis indicates that the positive magnetoresistance and the oscillations only occur when electrons are injected into in-gap defect states, whereas when electrons are injected into the conduction band the magnetoresistance vanishes. We propose a microscopic explanation for the observed phenomena that combines concepts typical of transport through disordered semiconductors with known properties of the CrPS$_4$ magnetic state, which captures all basic experimental observations. Our results illustrate the need to understand in detail the nature of transport through vdW magnets, to extract information about the nature of the order magnetic states and its microscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetization texture imprints produced by flux avalanches in ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic textures generated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field at the ferromagnetic layer of $Co/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb$ thin film heterostructures are investigated using magneto-optical imaging and micromagnetic simulations. It is observed that the stray field caused by flux avalanches in the superconducting layer prints out a non-trivial in-plane texture in the cobalt layer, which remains stable up to temperatures much above the Nb critical temperature. These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position. Micromagnetic simulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirm the interpretation given for the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Generalized model of incipient plasticity with parametric variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incipient plasticity is typically associated with thermally activated events like the nucleation of dislocations in crystalline solids and the activation of shear transformation zones in metallic glasses. A widely employed method of estimating the activation parameters of such mechanisms involves analyzing the statistical distribution of critical loads obtained through a series of repeated measurements. However, the conventional mathematical approach assumes the activation parameters to remain fixed during the sequence of measurements. The present study critically examines this premise and presents a generalized statistical model that allows the statistical variations of activation parameters. Using a simple Monte Carlo scheme, it is demonstrated that even small fluctuations of activation parameters can significantly affect the statistical distribution of measured critical loads. The Monte Carlo calculations, along with atomistic simulations, further show that imposing the assumption of rigidly fixed parameters on an activated process with parametric fluctuations can lead to severe underestimation of the activation parameters. As many experimental studies have consistently reported perplexingly small activation volumes estimated using the conventional statistical approach, we propose that our findings can offer a fresh perspective on this longstanding issue.</description>

      <title>Correlating Local Lattice Distortion with Dislocation Pinning in Refractory High-Entropy Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local lattice distortion (LLD) of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) plays an essential role in mechanical properties and phase stability. However, the random distribution of multi-principal constituents of RHEAs inhibits the comprehension of LLD, although LLD is suggested to couple with chemical short-range-order (SRO). Herein, an analytical model is built to determine the site-to-site LLD of RHEAs by coupling the local lattice sites, the local size ordering in their environments and the global constituent information. By elucidating the size coupling between components, the model demonstrates that LLD exhibits a mechanism similar to the relaxation of metal surfaces. Moreover, it is found that LLD, rather than chemical SRO, serves as the origin of solid-solution strengthening and as a measure of the phase transformation in RHEAs. The scheme provides a comprehensive physical picture and offers a quantitative measurement of LLD at macro and micro scales, laying a foundation for the design of RHEAs.</description>

Abstract: We present Quantum MASALA, a compact package that implements different electronic structure methods in Python using the plane-wave basis. Within just 8100 lines of pure Python code, we have implemented Density Functional Theory (DFT), Time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) and the GW Method. The program can run across multiple processors and in Graphical Processing Units (GPU) with the help of easily accessible Python libraries. With Quantum ESPRESSO and BerkeleyGW input interfaces implemented, it can also be used as a substitute for small and medium scale calculations, making it a perfect learning tool for ab initio methods. The package is aimed to provide a framework with its modular and simple code design to rapidly build and test new methods for first-principles calculation.</description>

      <title>Beyond the random phase approximation for calculating Curie temperatures in ferromagnets: application to Fe, Ni, Co and monolayer CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of solids are typically analyzed in terms of Heisenberg models where the electronic structure is approximated by interacting localized spins. However, even in such models the evaluation of thermodynamic properties constitutes a major challenge and is usually handled by a mean field decoupling scheme. The random phase approximation (RPA) comprises a common approach and is often applied to evaluate critical temperatures although it is well known that the method is only accurate well below the critical temperature. In the present work we compare the performance of the RPA with a different decoupling scheme proposed by Callen as well as the mean field decoupling of interacting Holstein-Primakoff (HP) magnons. We consider three-dimensional (3D) as well as two-dimensional (2D) model systems where the Curie temperature is governed by anisotropy. In 3D, the Callen method is the most accurate in the classical limit, and we show that the Callen decoupling produces the best agreement with experiments for bcc Fe, fcc Ni and fcc Co with exchange interactions obtained from first principles. In contrast, for low spin systems where a quantum mechanical treatment in pertinent, the HP and RPA methods appear are superior to the Callen decoupling. In 2D systems with magnetic order driven by single-ion anisotropy, it is shown that HP fails rather dramatically and both RPA and Callen approaches severely overestimates Curie temperatures. The most accurate approach is then constructed by combining RPA with the Callen decoupling of single-ion anisotropy, which yields the correct lack of order for S=1/2. We exemplify this by the case of monolayer CrI3 using exchange constant extracted from experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of Substrate on Spin-Wave Propagation Properties in Ferrimagnetic Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnets have distinctive spin-wave (SW) properties such as low magnetic damping and long SW coherence length making them ideal candidates for magnonics. Among them, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) is a ferrimagnetic insulator with unique magnetic properties including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and topological hall effect at room temperature when grown down to a few nanometers, extending its application to magnon spintronics. Here, the SW propagation properties of TmIG films (thickness of 7-34 nm) grown on GGG and sGGG substrates are studied at room temperature. Magnetic measurements show in-plane magnetic anisotropy for TmIG films grown on GGG and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy for films grown on sGGG substrates with PMA. SW electrical transmission spectroscopy measurements on TmIG/GGG films unveil magnetostatic surface spin waves (MSSWs) propagating up to 80 um with a SW group velocity of 2-8 km s^-1. Intriguingly, these MSSWs exhibit nonreciprocal propagation, opening new applications in SW functional devices. TmIG films grown on sGGG substrates exhibit forward volume spin waves with a reciprocal propagation behavior up to 32 um.</description>

      <title>Tuning the spin dynamics and magnetic phase transitions of the Cantor alloy via composition and sample processing protocols: A muon spin relaxation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CrMnFeCoNi, also called the Cantor alloy, is a well-known high-entropy alloy whose magnetic properties have recently become a focus of attention. We present a detailed muon spin relaxation study of the influence of chemical composition and sample processing protocols on the magnetic phase transitions and spin dynamics of several different Cantor alloy samples. Specific samples studied include a pristine equiatomic sample, samples with deficient and excess Mn content, and equiatomic samples magnetized in a field of 9 T or plastically deformed in pressures up to 0.5 GPa. The results confirm the sensitive dependence of the transition temperature on composition and demonstrate that post-synthesis pressure treatments cause the transition to become significantly less homogeneous throughout the sample volume. In addition, we observe critical spin dynamics in the vicinity of the transition in all samples, reminiscent of canonical spin glasses and magnetic materials with ideal continuous phase transitions. Application of an external magnetic field suppresses the critical dynamics in the Mn-deficient sample, while the equiatomic and Mn-rich samples show more robust critical dynamics. The spin-flip thermal activation energy in the paramagnetic phase increases with Mn content, ranging from $3.1(3) \times 10^{-21}$ J for 0% Mn to $1.2(2) \times 10^{-20}$ J for 30% Mn content. These results shed light on critical magnetic behavior in environments of extreme chemical disorder and demonstrate the tunability of spin dynamics in the Cantor alloy via chemical composition and sample processing.</description>

      <title>Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increases due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used for elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials synthesis optimization is constrained by serial feedback processes that rely on manual tools and intuition across multiple siloed modes of characterization. We automate and generalize feature extraction of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) data with machine learning to establish quantitatively predictive relationships in small sets (\~10) of expert-labeled data, saving significant time on subsequently grown samples. These predictive relationships are evaluated in a representative material system (\ce{W_{1-x}V_xSe2} on c-plane sapphire (0001)) with two aims: 1) predicting grain alignment of the deposited film using pre-growth substrate data, and 2) estimating vanadium dopant concentration using in-situ RHEED as a proxy for ex-situ methods (e.g. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). Both tasks are accomplished using the same materials-agnostic features, avoiding specific system retraining and leading to a potential 80\% time saving over a 100-sample synthesis campaign. These predictions provide guidance to avoid doomed trials, reduce follow-on characterization, and improve control resolution for materials synthesis.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Plateaus by the Field-Induced Partitioning of Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To search for a conceptual picture describing the magnetization plateau phenomenon, we surveyed the crystal structures and the spin lattices of those magnets exhibiting plateaus in their magnetization vs. magnetic field curves by probing the three questions: (a) why only certain magnets exhibit magnetization plateaus, (b) why there occur several different types of magnetization plateaus, and (c) what controls the widths of magnetization plateaus. We show that the answers to these questions lie in how the magnets under field absorb Zeeman energy hence changing their magnetic structures. The magnetic structure of a magnet insulator is commonly described in terms of its spin lattice, which requires the determination of the spin exchanges nonnegligible strengths between the magnetic ions. Our work strongly suggests that a magnet under magnetic field partitions its spin lattice into antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic fragments by breaking its weak magnetic bonds. Our supposition of the field-induced partitioning of spin lattice into magnetic fragments is supported by the anisotropic magnetization plateaus of Ising magnets and by the highly anisotropic width of the 1/3-magnetization plateau in azurite. The answers to the three questions (a) - (c) emerge naturally by analyzing how these fragments are formed under magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the moir\'e band structures and possible even denominator fractional quantum Hall state in small angle twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, using combined large-scale local basis density functional theory calculation and continuum model exact diagonalization. Via large-scale first principles calculations at $\theta=1.89^{\circ}$, we find a sequence of $C=1$(Chern number in K valley)moir\'e Chern bands, in analogy to Landau levels. By constructing the continuum model with multiple Chern bands, we undertake band-projected exact diagonalization using unscreened Coulomb repulsion to identify possible non-Abelian states near twist angle $\theta=1.89^{\circ}$ at the half filling of second moir\'e band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>
