      <title>Physically Consistent Global Atmospheric Data Assimilation with Machine Learning in a Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) provides more accurate, physically consistent analysis fields and is used for estimating initial conditions in numerical weather forecasting. Traditional DA methods derive statistically optimal analyses in model space based on Bayesian theory. However, their effectiveness is limited by the difficulty of accurately estimating the background error covariances matrix B, which represents the intricate interdependencies among atmospheric variables, as well as the standard linearity assumptions required during the assimilation step. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Data Assimilation (LDA) for a multi-variable global atmosphere, performing non-linear Machine-Learning based Bayesian DA on an atmospheric latent representation learned by an autoencoder. The feasibility of LDA is supported by the near-linear relationship between increments in latent space (within the typical magnitude range for DA) and their corresponding impacts in model space, ensuring that the optimal analysis obtained in latent space approximates the optimal analysis in model space. Due to the relationships among the atmospheric variables encoded in the latent space, LDA can physically propagate observation information across unobserved regions and atmospheric variables, even with a fully diagonal B in latent space. We perform idealized experiments with simulated observations and demonstrate the superiority of LDA over traditional DA methods in model space, while the experiments assimilating real observations highlight its potential application for operational reanalysis and weather forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The corresponding macroscopically large object in form of the AQN behaves as {\it chameleon}: it does not interact with the surrounding material in dilute environment and serves as perfect cold DM candidate. However, AQN becomes strongly interacting object in sufficiently dense environment. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events. In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance , etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also formulate a unique possible test which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of vortex cap solutions on the rotating unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically study the existence of periodic vortex cap solutions for the homogeneous and incompressible Euler equations on the rotating unit 2-sphere, which was numerically conjectured by Dritschel-Polvani and Kim-Sakajo-Sohn. Such solutions are piecewise constant vorticity distributions, subject to the Gauss constraint and rotating uniformly around the vertical axis. The proof is based on the bifurcation from zonal solutions given by spherical caps. For the one--interface case, the bifurcation eigenvalues correspond to Burbea's frequencies obtained in the planar case but shifted by the rotation speed of the sphere. The two--interfaces case (also called band type or strip type solutions) is more delicate. Though, for any fixed large enough symmetry, and under some non-degeneracy conditions to avoid spectral collisions, we achieve the existence of at most two branches of bifurcation.</description>

      <title>A multiscale model for weakly nonlinear shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves over periodically-varying bathymetry, based on the first-order hyperbolic Saint-Venant equations. Although solutions of this system are known to generally exhibit wave breaking, numerical experiments suggest a different behavior in the presence of periodic bathymetry. Starting from the first-order variable-coefficient hyperbolic system, we apply a multiple-scale perturbation approach in order to derive a system of constant-coefficient high-order partial differential equations whose solution approximates that of the original system. The high-order system turns out to be dispersive and exhibits solitary-wave formation, in close agreement with direct numerical simulations of the original system. We show that the constant-coefficient homogenized system can be used to study the properties of solitary waves and to conduct efficient numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Changes over time in the 100-year return value of climate model variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess evidence for changes in tail characteristics of wind, solar irradiance and temperature variables output from CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) due to climate forcing. We estimate global and climate zone annual maximum and annual means for period (2015, 2100) from daily output of seven GCMs for daily wind speed, maximum wind speed, solar irradiance and near-surface temperature. We calculate corresponding annualised data for individual locations within neighbourhoods of the North Atlantic and Celtic Sea region. We consider output for three climate scenarios and multiple climate ensembles. We estimate non-stationary extreme value models for annual extremes, and non-homogeneous Gaussian regressions for annual means, using Bayesian inference. We use estimated statistical models to quantify the distribution of (i) the change in 100-year return value for annual extremes, and (2) the change in annual mean, over the period (2025, 2125). To summarise results, we estimate linear mixed effects models for observed variation of (i) and (ii). Evidence for changes in the 100-year return value for annual maxima of solar irradiance and temperature is much stronger than for wind variables over time and with climate scenario.</description>
