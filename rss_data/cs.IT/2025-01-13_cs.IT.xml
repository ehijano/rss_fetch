      <title>Bounds on Box Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n_q(M,d)$ be the minimum length of a $q$-ary code of size $M$ and minimum distance $d$. Bounding $n_q(M,d)$ is a fundamental problem that lies at the heart of coding theory. This work considers a generalization $n^\bx_q(M,d)$ of $n_q(M,d)$ corresponding to codes in which codewords have \emph{protected} and \emph{unprotected} entries; where (analogs of) distance and of length are measured with respect to protected entries only. Such codes, here referred to as \emph{box codes}, have seen prior studies in the context of bipartite graph covering. Upper and lower bounds on $n^\bx_q(M,d)$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Computation Offloading in Priority-Driven Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for fully decentralized offloading policy design in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. The system comprises $N$ power-constrained user equipments (UEs) assisted by an edge server (ES) to process incoming tasks. Tasks are labeled with urgency flags, and in this paper, we classify them under three urgency levels, namely, high, moderate, and low urgency. We formulate the problem of designing computation decisions for the UEs within a large population noncooperative game framework, where each UE selfishly decides on how to split task execution between its local onboard processor and the ES. We employ the weighted average age of information (AoI) metric to quantify information freshness at the UEs. Increased onboard processing consumes more local power, while increased offloading may potentially incur a higher average AoI due to other UEs' packets being offloaded to the same ES. Thus, we use the mean-field game (MFG) formulation to compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium offloading and local computation policies for the UEs to balance between the information freshness and local power consumption. Finally, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically assess the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Differential Properties of Information in Jump-diffusion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a channel modeling using jump-diffusion processes, and study the differential properties of entropy and mutual information. By utilizing the Kramers-Moyal and Kolmogorov-Feller equations, we express the mutual information between the input and the output in series and integral forms, presented by Fisher-type information and mismatched KL divergence. We extend de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation to encompass general Markov processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the delay probability of the first error position in perturbation-enhanced Successive cancellation (SC) decoding for polar codes. Our findings reveal that, asymptotically, an SC decoder's performance does not degrade after one perturbation, and it improves with a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$. This analysis explains the sustained performance gains of perturbation-enhanced SC decoding as code length increases.</description>

      <title>From Bit to Block: Decoding on Erasure Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for bounding the block error threshold of a linear code $C\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^N$ over the erasure channel in terms of its bit error threshold. Our approach relies on understanding the minimum support weight of any $r$-dimensional subcode of $C$, for all small values of $r$. As a proof of concept, we use our machinery to obtain a new proof of the celebrated result that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity on the erasure channel with respect to block error probability.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer RIS on Edge: Communication, Computation and Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration into various applications highlight the need for advanced communication, computation, and energy transfer techniques. However, the traditional hardware-based evolution of communication systems faces challenges due to excessive power consumption and prohibitive hardware cost. With the rapid advancement of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a new approach by parallel stacking a series of RIS, i.e., multi-layer RIS, has been proposed. Benefiting from the characteristics of scalability, passivity, low cost, and enhanced computation capability, multi-layer RIS is a promising technology for future massive IoT scenarios. Thus, this article proposes a multi-layer RIS-based universal paradigm at the network edge, enabling three functions, i.e., multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, computation, and wireless power transfer (WPT). Starting by picturing the possible applications of multi-layer RIS, we explore the potential signal transmission links, energy transmission links, and computation processes in IoT scenarios, showing its ability to handle on-edge IoT tasks and associated green challenges. Then, these three key functions are analyzed respectively in detail, showing the advantages of the proposed scheme, compared with the traditional hardware-based scheme. To facilitate the implementation of this new paradigm into reality, we list the dominant future research directions at last, such as inter-layer channel modeling, resource allocation and scheduling, channel estimation, and edge training. It is anticipated that multi-layer RIS will contribute to more energy-efficient wireless networks in the future by introducing a revolutionary paradigm shift to an all-wave-based approach.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Influence of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks: Analyzing S-Band Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving comprehensive global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Given the escalating demand for spectrum, there is an ongoing global discourse on the feasibility of sharing certain frequencies currently utilized by terrestrial networks (TNs) with NTNs. However, this sharing leads to co-channel interference and subsequent performance degradation. This paper specifically investigates the interference caused by NTNs on TNs in the S-band and its relationship with the relative position between satellite and TN user equipment. We analyzed the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and employed the ITU two-state model for our interference analysis. Through simulations, we evaluated the interference intensity at different separation distances and slant ranges. Our findings reveal that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly influences the interference level. Furthermore, we determine the minimum separation distance needed to keep the interference-to-noise ratio of NTN interference below 0 dB.</description>

      <title>Regularized Top-$k$: A Bayesian Framework for Gradient Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed settings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as their accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially behaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although this property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed gradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work proposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps: first, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability (inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as a maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from Top-$k$, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a regularized form of Top-$k$. We call this algorithm regularized Top-$k$ (RegTop-$k$). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated gradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our derivation through numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it is observed that while Top-$k$ remains at a fixed distance from the global optimum, RegTop-$k$ converges to the global optimum at significantly higher compression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this observation by employing RegTop-$k$ in distributed training of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, where it noticeably outperforms Top-$k$.</description>

      <title>Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture recently proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where many satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimation and conjugate beamforming. Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in both fading and non-fading scenarios, with significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, number of UTs, number of SAPs, orbital altitude, and service range brought by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT bring higher coverage probability despite existing multi-user interference. Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, which provides valuable system design insights.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage probabilities of UTs under different channel conditions. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and the benefit of NOMA only exists when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35\%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Antenna Architectures with Unitary Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in the number of base station (BS) antennas calls for efficient solutions to deal with the increased interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity of traditional centralized approaches. Decentralized approaches are thus gaining momentum, since they achieve important reductions in data/processing volume by preprocessing the received signals before forwarding them to a central node. The WAX framework offers a general description of decentralized architectures with arbitrary interplay between interconnection bandwidth and decentralized processing complexity, but the applicability of this framework has only been studied assuming unrestricted baseband processing. We consider an adaptation of the WAX framework where the decentralized processing has unitary restriction, which allows for energy-efficient implementations based on reconfigurable impedance networks at the cost of some performance loss. Moreover, we propose an effective method to minimize the performance gap with respect to centralized processing. The previous method gives a first step towards characterizing the information-lossless trade-off between interconnection bandwidth and processing complexity in decentralized architectures with unitary constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an agnostic signal reconstruction method for zero-knowledge one-way communication channels in which a receiver aims to interpret a message sent by an unknown source about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our reconstruction method is agnostic vis-\`a-vis the arbitrarily chosen encoding-decoding scheme and other observer-dependent characteristics, such as the arbitrarily chosen computational model, probability distributions, or underlying mathematical theory. We investigate how non-random messages encode information about their intended physical properties, such as dimension and length scales of the space in which a signal or message may have been originally encoded, embedded, or generated. We focus on image data as a first illustration of the capabilities of the new method. We argue that our results have applications to life and technosignature detection, and to coding theory in general.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation, where a single input $x$ is mapped to a single output $y$. In prior work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a minimal cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff between these three resources. Our result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" with implications for the relationship between the Second Law and the Physical Church-Turing thesis.</description>
