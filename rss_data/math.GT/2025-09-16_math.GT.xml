      <title>Bounds on bending in terms of the Schwartzian derivative and Teichm\"uller distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally-univalent maps $f: \Delta \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ can be parametrized by their Schwartzian derivatives $Sf$, a quadratic differential whose norm $\|Sf\|_\infty$ measures how close $f$ is to being M\"obius. In particular, by Nehari, if $\|Sf\|_\infty &lt; 1/2$ then $f$ is univalent and if $f$ is univalent then $\|Sf\|_\infty &lt; 3/2$. Thurston gave another parametrization associating to $f$ a bending measured lamination $\beta_f$ which has a natural norm $\|\beta_f\|_L$. In this paper, we give an explicit bound on $\|\beta_f\|_L$ as a function of $\|Sf\|_\infty$ for $\|Sf\|_\infty &lt; 1/2$. One application is a bound on the bending measured lamination of a quasifuchsian group in terms of the Teichmuller distance between the conformal structures on the two components of the conformal boundary.</description>

      <title>A new approach to (3+1)-dimensional TQFTs via topological modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a construction toward a new type of TQFTs at the crossroads of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, physics, and homotopy theory. It assigns TMF-modules to closed 3-manifolds and maps of TMF-modules to 4-dimensional cobordisms. This is a mathematical proposal for one of the simplest examples in a family of ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$-valued invariants of 4-manifolds which are expected to arise from 6-dimensional superconformal field theories. As part of the construction, we define TMF-modules associated with symmetric bilinear forms, using (spectral) derived algebraic geometry. The invariant of unimodular bilinear forms takes values in ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$, conjecturally generalizing the theta function of a lattice. We discuss gluing properties of the invariants. We also demonstrate some interesting physics applications of the TMF-modules such as distinguishing phases of quantum field theories in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis in Finsler Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Topological Data Analysis (TDA) based on Finsler metrics and we also generalize the classical concepts of Vietoris-Rips and Cech complexes within this framework. In particular, we propose a class of directionally dependent Finsler metrics and establish key results demonstrating their relevance to TDA. Moreover, we show that several Information Theoretic perspectives on TDA can often be recovered through the lens of Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>On manifolds homeomorphic to spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a result analogous to Reeb's theorem in the context of Morse-Bott functions: if a closed, smooth manifold $M$ admits a Morse-Bott function having two critical submanifolds $S^k$ and $S^l$ ($k \neq l$), then $M$ has dimension $k+l+1$ and is homeomorphic to the standard sphere $S^{k+l+1}$ but not necessarily diffeomorphic to it. We also prove similar results for projective spaces over the real numbers, complex numbers and quaternions.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof that linking problems are hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new, elementary proof of what we believe is the simplest known example of a ``natural'' problem in computational 3-dimensional topology that is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard -- namely, the \emph{Trivial Sublink Problem}: given a diagram $L$ of a link in $S^3$ and a positive integer $k$, decide if $L$ contains a $k$ component sublink that is trivial. This problem was previously shown to be $\mathsf{NP}$-hard in independent works of Koenig-Tsvietkova and de Mesmay-Rieck-Sedgwick-Tancer, both of which used reductions from $\mathsf{3SAT}$. The reduction we describe instead starts with the Independent Set Problem, and allows us to avoid the use of Brunnian links such as the Borromean rings. On the technical level, this entails a new conceptual insight: the Trivial Sublink Problem is hard entirely due to mod 2 pairwise linking, with no need for integral or higher order linking. On the pedagogical level, the reduction we describe is entirely elementary, and thus suitable for introducing undergraduates and non-experts to complexity-theoretic low-dimensional topology. To drive this point home, in this work we assume no familiarity with low-dimensional topology, and -- other than Reidemeister's Theorem and Karp's result that the Clique Problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard -- we provide more-or-less complete definitions and proofs. We have also constructed a web app that accompanies this work and allows a user to visualize the new reduction interactively.</description>

      <title>Signature 0 toric varieties, wall crossings, and cross polytope-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a gamma vector equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is expected that the cases where the gamma vector is 0 form ``building blocks'' among those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood.
  For such toric varieties, we address this situation using wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these ``anchoring'' linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles expected to cover the minimal objects described above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the authors extended Mirzakhani's (almost-everywhere defined) measurable conjugacy between the earthquake and horocycle flows to a measurable bijection. In this one, we analyze the continuity properties of this map and its inverse, proving that both are continuous at many points and in many directions. This lets us transfer measure convergence between the two systems, allowing us to pull back results from Teichm{\"u}ller dynamics to deduce analogous statements for the earthquake flow.</description>

      <title>Cusp types of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining when a flat manifold can occur as a cusp cross-section within a given commensurability class of cusped arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. This reduces the problem of identifying which commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds can contain a specific flat manifold as a cusp cross-section to a question involving rational representations of the flat manifold's holonomy group. More generally we show that the holonomy representation provides an obstruction on the quasi-arithmetic manifolds containing a given flat manifold as a cusp cross-section. As applications, we prove that a flat manifold $M$ with a holonomy group of odd order appears as a cusp cross-section in every commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds if and only if $b_1(M)\geq 3$. We also provide examples of flat manifolds that arise as cusp cross-sections in a unique commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds and exhibit examples of pairs of flat manifolds that can never appear as cusp cross-sections in the same quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>High dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an iterative procedure for constructing hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber over $\mathbb{Z}$ that is flexible enough to yield infinitely many isomorphism classes in each virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) $n\geq 2$. Our procedure combines results of Jankiewicz, Norin, and Wise with a generalization of a construction due to Osajda involving a new simplicial thickening process. We also give a topological argument showing that the vcd of the right-angled Coxeter groups produced by our construction increases by exactly one with each iteration, guaranteeing that our process produces examples of every vcd.</description>

      <title>Engel CR submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for an $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a $3$-manifold to admit an immersion (or embedding) into $\mathbb{C}^3$ so that its complex tangencies define an Engel structure. In particular, every oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a closed, oriented $3$-manifold admits such an immersion. If the bundle is trivial, this immersion can be chosen to be an embedding and, moreover, infinitely many pairwise smoothly non-isotopic embeddings of this type can be constructed. These are the first examples of compact submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$ whose complex tangencies are Engel, answering a question of Y. Eliashberg.</description>
