      <title>Methodology for 3D sound synthesis of directional acoustic sources by higher-order ambisonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the 3D soundfield synthesis of the pressure field radiated by directional acoustic sources using both the multimodal method and higher-order ambisonics (HOA). Ambisonics is a technique for encoding and reproducing measured or modeled (virtual) sound pressure field, based on a decomposition of the acoustic field over spherical harmonics. The directional source considered in this work is an acoustic horn excited by a flat piston. The free-field radiation from this horn is first modeled accurately over a wide frequency range using the multimodal method, which requires relatively low computational resources. This radiated pressure field, collected on a dual-layer sphere of virtual sensors distributed over a Lebedev geometry, allows its projection into the ambisonic domain. The pressure field is then synthesized in the laboratory's 3D 5th order HOA spatialization sphere, which consists of fifty-six loudspeakers. This offers the ability of listening to the radiated sound using a higher-order ambisonic synthesis of a 'virtual' source before it is manufactured. To qualitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure, the transfer function of the synthesized horn is measured around the listening point within the spatialization sphere.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of massive and massless particles in the spacetime of a wiggly cosmic dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spacetime containing both small-scale structures (wiggles) and spatial dislocation, forming a wiggly cosmic dislocation. We study the combined effects of these features on the dynamics of massive and massless particles. Our results show that while wiggles alone lead to bound states and dislocation introduces angular momentum corrections, their coupling produces more complex effects, influencing both particle motion and wave propagation. Notably, this coupling significantly modifies radial solutions and eigenvalues, with the direction of motion or propagation becoming a critical factor in determining the outcomes. Numerical solutions reveal detailed aspects of particle dynamics as functions of dislocation and string parameters, including plots of trajectories, radial probability densities, and energy levels. These findings deepen our understanding of how a wiggly cosmic dislocation shapes particle dynamics, suggesting new directions for theoretical exploration in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Eclectic Notes on Uncertainty, Information, and Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information is everywhere in nature which is very uncertain and unpredictable. But information, in itself, is a very ambiguous term. In this cursory write-up, we attempt to understand the formal meaning of information by quantifying uncertainty and discuss how it naturally appears in two core topics of classical physics -- classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In the process, we witness how the concepts of the information theory render a unique viewpoint in physics. Except for the presentation of the material, the author claims no originality; however, the responsibility of every inadvertent error lies entirely with the author.</description>

      <title>Physical Modeling of Piano Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a comprehensive physical model and numerical simulation schemes for a grand piano. The model encompasses various subsystems, including hammer felt, hammer shank, string, soundboard, air and room barriers, each modeled in three dimensions to approach their realistic dynamics. A general framework for 3D elastic solids accounting for prestress and prestrain is introduced, particularly addressing the the nonlinearities arising from the large deformation of piano strings and the one-sided nature of hammer felt-string contact. The study also examines coupling between subsystem through mechanisms of surface force transmission and displacement/velocity continuity. To facilitate numerical simulations, strong PDEs are translated into weak ODEs via a flexible space discretization approach. Modal transformation of system ODEs is then employed to decouple and reduce DOFs, and an explicit time discretization scheme is customized for generating digital audio in the time domain. The study concludes with a discussion of the piano models capabilities, limitations, and potential future enhancements.</description>
