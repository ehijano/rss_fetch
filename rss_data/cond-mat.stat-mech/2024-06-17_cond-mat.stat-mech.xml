      <title>Kibble-Zurek Mechanism and Beyond: Lessons from a Holographic Superfluid Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superfluid phase transition dynamics and associated spontaneous vortex formation with the crossing of the critical temperature in a disk geometry is studied in the framework of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence by solving the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model in an $AdS_4$ black hole. For a slow quench, the vortex density admits a universal scaling law with the cooling rate as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), while for fast quenches, the density shows a universal scaling behavior as a function of the final temperature, that lies beyond the KZM prediction. The vortex number distribution in both the power-law and saturation regimes can be approximated by a normal distribution. However, the study of the universal scaling of the cumulants reveals non-normal features and indicates that vortex statistics in the newborn superfluid is best described by the Poisson binomial distribution, previously predicted in the KZM regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 240602 (2020)]. This is confirmed by studying the cumulant scalings as a function of the quench time and the quench depth. Our work supports the existence of a universal defect number distribution that accommodates the KZM scaling, its breakdown at fast quenches, and the additional universal scaling laws as a function of the final value of the control parameter.</description>

      <title>Managing Singular Kernels and Logarithmic Corrections in the Staggered Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral properties of the staggered six-vertex model with ${\cal Z}_2$ symmetry for arbitrary system sizes $L$ using non-linear integral equations (NLIEs). Our study is motivated by two key questions: what is the accuracy of results based on the ODE/IQFT correspondence in the asymptotic regime of large system sizes, and what is the optimal approach based on NLIE for analyzing the staggered six-vertex model?
  We demonstrate that the quantization conditions for low-lying primary and descendant states, derived from the ODE/IQFT approach in the scaling limit, are impressively accurate even for relatively small system sizes. Specifically, in the anisotropy parameter range $\pi/4 &lt; \gamma &lt; \pi/2$, the difference between NLIE and ODE/IQFT results for energy and quasi-momentum eigenvalues is of order $\mathcal{O}(L^{-2})$.
  Furthermore, we present a unifying framework for NLIEs, distinguishing between versions with singular and regular kernels. We provide a compact derivation of NLIE with a singular kernel, followed by an equivalent set with a regular kernel. We address the stability issues in numerical treatments and offer solutions to achieve high-accuracy results, validating our approach for system sizes ranging from $L=2$ to $L=10^{24}$.
  Our findings not only validate the ODE/IQFT approach for finite system sizes but also enhance the understanding of NLIEs in the context of the staggered six-vertex model. We hope the insights gained from this study have significant implications for resolving the spectral problem of other lattice systems with emergent non-compact degrees of freedom and provide a foundation for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of non-extensive term in Massieu functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the significance of non-extensive terms in Massieu functions. We demonstrate that these terms, of order $\ln N$, where $N$ represents the number of elements, can be expressed in relation to thermodynamic fluctuations. We focus on systems large enough to mitigate finite size effects, concentrating on the $O(\ln N)$ difference present in both ideal and non-ideal scenarios. The analytical verification in ideal cases and numerical validation in non-ideal scenarios corroborate our results. The examples used are hard sphere and hard disk fluids and a one-dimensional spin lattice, emphasizing the applicability of the results across different classes of systems.</description>

      <title>Partial stochastic resetting with refractory periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of refractory periods in partial resetting processes is studied. Under Poissonian partial resets, a state variable jumps to a value closer to the origin by a fixed fraction at constant rate, $x\to a x$. Following each reset, a stationary refractory period of arbitrary duration takes place. We derive an exact closed-form expression for the propagator in Fourier-Laplace space, which shows rich dynamical features such as connections not only to other resetting schemes but also to intermittent motion. For diffusive processes, we use the propagator to derive exact expressions for time dependent moments of $x$ at all orders. At late times the system reaches a non-equilibrium steady state which takes the form of a mixture distribution that splits the system into two subpopulations; trajectories that at any given time in the stationary regime find themselves in the freely evolving phase, and those that are in the refractory phase. In contrast to conventional resetting, partial resets give rise to non-trivial steady states even for the refractory subpopulation. Moments and cumulants associated with the steady state density are studied, and we show that a universal optimum for the kurtosis can be found as a function of mean refractory time, determined solely by the strength of the resetting and the mean inter-reset time. The presented results could be of relevance to growth-collapse processes with periods of inactivity following a collapse.</description>

      <title>Boosting information transfer in a quantum correlated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing and receiving information plays a pivotal role in science and technology. Quantum communication relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to transmit information in a nonclassical manner. Existing quantum communication protocols are commonly based on shared entangled states between sender and receiver, while the transmitting medium is classical. We here demonstrate that information transfer may be enhanced in a quantum correlated medium without entanglement distribution. We concretely show that nonclassical correlations, with nonzero discord, between the first two spins of a spin chain that acts as a quantum wire can increase the information flow and reduce the propagation time. We relate this effect to the breaking of the spatial symmetry of the out-of-time-order correlator that characterizes the spread of information through the medium.</description>

      <title>Physical networks become what they learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical networks can develop diverse responses, or functions, by design, evolution or learning. We focus on electrical networks of nodes connected by resistive edges. Such networks can learn by adapting edge conductances to lower a cost function that penalizes deviations from a desired response. The network must also satisfy Kirchhoff's law, balancing currents at nodes, or, equivalently, minimizing total power dissipation by adjusting node voltages. The adaptation is thus a double optimization process, in which a cost function is minimized with respect to conductances, while dissipated power is minimized with respect to node voltages. Here we study how this physical adaptation couples the cost landscape, the landscape of the cost function in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, to the physical landscape, the dissipated power in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. We show how adaptation links the physical and cost Hessian matrices, suggesting that the physical response of networks to perturbations holds significant information about the functions to which they are adapted.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider restricted Boltzmann machines with a binary visible layer and a Gaussian hidden layer trained by an unlabelled dataset composed of noisy realizations of a single ground pattern. We develop a statistical mechanics framework to describe the network generative capabilities, by exploiting the replica trick and assuming self-averaging of the underlying order parameters (i.e., replica symmetry). In particular, we outline the effective control parameters (e.g., the relative number of weights to be trained, the regularization parameter), whose tuning can yield qualitatively-different operative regimes. Further, we provide analytical and numerical evidence for the existence of a sub-region in the space of the hyperparameters where replica-symmetry breaking occurs.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Majorization requires infinitely many second laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorization is a fundamental model of uncertainty with several applications in areas ranging from thermodynamics to entanglement theory, and constitutes one of the pillars of the resource-theoretic approach to physics. Here, we improve on its relation to measurement apparatuses. In particular, after discussing what the proper notion of second law in this scenario is, we show that, for a sufficiently large state space, any family of entropy-like functions constituting a second law must be countably infinite. Moreover, we provide an analogous result for a variation of majorization known as thermo-majorization which, in fact, does not require any constraint on the state space provided the equilibrium distribution is not uniform. Lastly, we discuss the applicability of our results to molecular diffusion and catalytic majorization. In this regard, we consider a variation of majorization used in plasma physics as a model of molecular diffusion and show that no finite family of entropy-like functions constituting a second law of molecular diffusion exists. Moreover, we show how our results are useful when dealing with a conjecture regarding catalytic majorization (i.e. trumping). In particular, we show that the sort of characterizations of trumping that have been considered before require an infinite family of real-valued functions.</description>

      <title>Effective affinity for generic currents in nonequilibrium processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mesoscopic experiments it is common to observe a single fluctuating current, such as the position of a molecular motor, while the complete set of currents is inaccessible. For such scenarios with partial information we introduce an effective affinity for generic currents in Markov processes. The effective affinity quantifies dissipative and fluctuation properties of fluctuating currents. Notably, the effective affinity multiplied by the current lower bounds the rate of dissipation, and the effective affinity determines first-passage and extreme value statistics of fluctuating currents. In addition, we determine the conditions under which the effective affinity has a stalling force interpretation. To derive these results we introduce a family of martingales associated with generic currents.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Evolutionary Rates of Biological Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07533v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the maximum speed at which biological evolution can occur. I derive inequalities that limit the rate of evolutionary processes driven by natural selection, mutations, or genetic drift. These \emph{rate limits} link the variability in a population to evolutionary rates. In particular, high variances in the fitness of a population and of a quantitative trait allow for fast changes in the trait's average. In contrast, low variability makes a trait less susceptible to random changes due to genetic drift. The results in this article generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to dynamics that allow for mutations and genetic drift, via trade-off relations that constrain the evolutionary rates of arbitrary traits. The rate limits can be used to probe questions in various evolutionary biology and ecology settings. They apply, for instance, to trait dynamics within or across species or to the evolution of bacteria strains. They apply to any quantitative trait, e.g., from species' weights to the lengths of DNA strands.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and intrinsic effects setting viscosity in complex fluids and life processes: the role of fundamental physical constants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the values and origin of fundamental physical constants, one of the grandest challenges in modern science, has been discussed in particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. More recently, it was realised that fundamental constants have a bio-friendly window set by life processes involving motion and flow. This window is related to intrinsic fluid properties such as energy and length scales in condensed matter set by fundamental constants. Here, we discuss important extrinsic factors governing the viscosity of complex fluids operating in life processes due to collective effects. We show that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting viscosity need to be taken into account when estimating the bio-friendly range of fundamental constants from life processes, and our discussion provides a straightforward recipe for doing this. We also find that the relative role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors depends on the range of variability of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Remarkably, the viscosity of a complex fluid such as blood with significant extrinsic effects is not far from the intrinsic viscosity calculated using the fundamental constants only, and we discuss the reason for this in terms of dynamics of contact points between cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing high-dimensional partial differential equations to derive effective actions within the functional renormalization group is formidable, especially when considering various field configurations, including inhomogeneous states, even on lattices. We leverage physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations to overcome this challenge. In a zero-dimensional O($N$) model, we numerically demonstrate the construction of an effective action on an $N$-dimensional configuration space, extending up to $N=100$. Our results underscore the effectiveness of PINN approximation, even in scenarios lacking small parameters such as a small coupling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Structure and Information Protection in Noisy Hybrid Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions, the influence of quantum noises, which are inherent in real physical systems, is of great importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the effects of both temporally uncorrelated and correlated quantum noises on entanglement generation and information protection. This investigation reveals that entanglement within the system follows $q^{-1/3}$ scaling for both types of quantum noises, where $q$ represents the noise probability. The scaling arises from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuation with effective length scale $L_{\text{eff}} \sim q^{-1}$. More importantly, the information protection timescales of the steady states are explored and shown to follow $q^{-1/2}$ and $q^{-2/3}$ scaling for temporally uncorrelated and correlated noises, respectively. The former scaling can be interpreted as a Hayden-Preskill protocol, while the latter is a direct consequence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. We conduct extensive numerical simulations using stabilizer formalism to support the theoretical understanding. This Letter not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum noises and measurement-induced phase transition but also provides a new perspective to understand the effects of Markovian and non-Markovian noises on quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting homogeneous three-dimensional gas in canonical ensemble when both particle number $N$ and total momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of all particles are fixed. Using the saddle point method, we derive the large-$N$ analytical approximations for partition function, free energy, and statistical distributions of occupation numbers of different single-particle energy levels. At temperatures below the critical point of phase transition, we predict, in some ranges of $\mathbf{P}$, fragmentation of the condensate, when more than one single-particle level is macroscopically occupied. The occupation number distributions have approximately Gaussian shapes for the levels hosting the condensate, and exponential shapes for other, noncondensate levels. Our analysis demonstrates breaking of Galilean invariance of moving finite-temperature many-particle system in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation and extends the theory of moving and rotating quantum systems to the finite-temperature large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography scheme based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed "dual-unitary shadow tomography" (DUST). For this we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits. Our results are robust to finite-size effects due to the chirality of dual-unitary brick-wall circuits.</description>
