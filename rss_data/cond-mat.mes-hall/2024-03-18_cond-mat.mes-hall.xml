      <title>Phonon Linewidths in Twisted Bilayer Graphene near Magic Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the phonon linewidths in twisted bilayer graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions and anharmonic effects. The electronic structure is calculated using distance-dependent transfer integrals based on the atomistic Slater-Koster tight-binding formalism. Furthermore, electron-electron interactions are treated at the Hartree level. The force constants for the phonon calculations are generated from classical force fields. These ingredients are used to calculate the phonon linewidths arising from electron-phonon interactions. Additionally, we account for the effects of phonon-phonon interactions on the linewidths by computing the mode-projected velocity autocorrelation function from classical molecular dynamics. Our findings show that both electron-phonon and anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the linewidth of the Raman active G mode near the magic angle. We predict a moir\'e potential induced splitting of this mode, which arises due to contributions from high symmetry stacking regions.</description>

      <title>Dark versus blocking states in electronic transport: a Lee-Yang zero analysis of full counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic transport through nanostructures can be suppressed by coherent population trapping, in which quantum coherence leads to a dark state that decouples from the drain electrode. Finite transport, then, relies on decoherence of the dark state. An alternative scenario for reduced transport is weak coupling of a state, referred to as a blocking state, to the drain. This raises the question of whether and how these two scenarios can be distinguished in the transport features. For the example of electron transport through a carbon nanotube, we identify regimes, in which this distinction is possible by analyzing the full counting statistics in terms of Lee-Yang zeros and factorial cumulants.</description>

      <title>Role of many phonon modes on the high-temperature linear-in-$T$ electronic resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider the possibility that phonons may be playing a role in the observed linear-in-$T$ resistivity in cuprates by focusing on the obvious question: How can phonon scattering be consistent with a linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a constant slope given that cuprates have many phonon modes with different energies and electron-phonon couplings (e.g. 21 phonon modes for LSCO)? We show using an arbitrarily large number of independent phonon modes that, within a model Boltzmann transport theory, the emergent high-$T$ linear-in-$T$ resistivity manifests an approximately constant slope independent of the number of phonon modes except in some fine-tuned narrow temperature regimes. We also comment on the quantitative magnitude of the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in cuprates pointing out the constraints on the effective electron-phonon coupling necessary to produce the observed resistivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects in the interaction of low-energy electrons with light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between free electrons and nanoscale optical fields has emerged as a unique platform to investigate ultrafast processes in matter and explore fundamental quantum phenomena. In particular, optically modulated electrons are employed in ultrafast electron microscopy as noninvasive probes that push the limits of spatiotemporal and spectral resolution down to the picometer--attosecond--microelectronvolt range. Electron kinetic energies well above the involved photon energies are commonly employed, rendering the electron--light coupling efficiency low and, thus, only providing limited access to the wealth of quantum nonlinear phenomena underlying the dynamical response of nanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate electron--light interactions when photons and electrons have comparable energies, revealing strong quantum and recoil effects that include a nonvanishing coupling of surface-scattered electrons to plane waves of light, inelastic electron backscattering from localized optical fields, and strong electron--light coupling under grazing electron diffraction by an illuminated crystal surface. Our results open new vistas in electron--light--matter interactions with promising applications in ultrafast electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Topological frequency conversion in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

      <title>Anomalous external-magnetic-field dependence of dephasing in a spin bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the dephasing of a central spin-1 model. An interesting mechanism of spin decoherence is found with this model, namely {\em hyperfine mediated spectral diffusion}. This mechanism contains both the features of dipolar interactions induced spectral diffusion and hyperfine mediated interactions. We also find an anomalous magnetic field dependence of decoherence, which is caused by the competition between crystal field splitting and Zeeman splitting of the central spin. As the external magnetic field increases, in the V type level structure regime, the decoherence rate becomes much stronger; while in the cascade type level structure regime, just like localized electron spin in quantum dots, the decoherence rate becomes much weaker.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of a quantum dot array interacting with a far-infrared photon mode of a cylindrical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the equilibrium properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a square lateral superlattice of quantum dots in a GaAs heterostructure subject to an external homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field and a far-infrared circular cylindrical photon cavity with one quantized mode, the TE011 mode. In a truncated linear basis constructed by a tensor product of the single-electron states of the noninteracting system and the eigenstates of the photon number operator, a local spin density approximation of density functional theory is used to compute the electron-photon states of the two-dimensional electron gas in the cavity. The common spatial symmetry of the vector fields for the external magnetic field and the cavity photon field in the long wavelength approximation enhances higher order magnetic single- and multi-photon processes for both the para- and the diamagnetic electron-photon interactions. The electron-photon coupling introduces explicit photon replicas into the bandstructure and all subbands gain a photon content, constant for each subband, that can deviate from an integer value as the coupling is increased or the photon energy is varied. The subbands show a complex Rabi anticrossing behavior when the photon energy and the coupling bring subbands into resonances. The complicated energy subband structure leads to photon density variations in reciprocal space when resonances occur in the spectrum. The electron-photon coupling polarizes the charge density and tends to reduce the Coulomb exchange effects as the coupling strength increases.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magneto-photothermal voltage in Sb2Te3 topological insulator thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied longitudinal and Hall photothermal voltages under a planar magnetic field scan in epitaxial thin films of the Topological Insulator (TI) Sb2Te3, grown using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Unlike prior research that utilised polarised light-induced photocurrent to investigate the TI, our study introduces advancements based on unpolarized light-induced local heating. This method yields a thermoelectric response exhibiting a direct signature of strong spin-orbit coupling. Our analysis reveals three distinct contributions when fitting the photothermal voltage data to the angular dependence of the planar magnetic field. The interaction between the applied magnetic field and the thermal gradient on the bulk band orbitals enables the differentiation between the ordinary Nernst effect from the out-of-plane thermal gradient and an extraordinary magneto-thermal contribution from the planar thermal gradient. The fitting of our data to theoretical models indicates that these effects primarily arise from the bulk states of the TI rather than the surface states. These findings highlight PLD-grown epitaxial topological insulator thin films as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices, including sensors and actuators. Such devices offer controllable responses through position-dependent, non-invasive local heating via focused incident light and variations in the applied magnetic field direction.</description>

      <title>Effects of spin-orbit coupling in a valley chiral kagom\'e network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valley chiral kagom\'e networks can arise in various situations, like for example, in double-aligned graphene-hexagonal boron nitride and periodically strained graphene. Here, we construct a phenomenological scattering model based on the symmetries of the network to investigate the energy spectrum and magnetotransport in this system. Additionally, we consider the effects of a finite Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the transport properties of the kagom\'e network. We identify conditions where the interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the geometry of the lattice results in a reduction of the periodicity of the magnetoconductance and characteristic sharp resonances. Moreover, we find a finite spin-polarization of the conductance, which could be exploited in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Steering internal and outgoing electron dynamics in bilayer graphene cavities by cavity design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ballistic, gate-defined devices in two-dimensional materials offer a platform for electron optics phenomena influenced by the material's properties and gate control. We study the ray trajectory dynamics of all-electronic, gate-defined cavities in bilayer graphene to establish how distinct regimes of the internal and outgoing charge carrier dynamics can be tuned and optimized by the cavity shape, symmetry, and parameter choice, e.g., the band gap and the cavity orientation. In particular, we compare the dynamics of two cavity shapes, o'nigiri, and Lima\c{c}on cavities, which fall into different symmetry classes. We demonstrate that for stabilising regular, internal cavity modes, such as periodic and whispering gallery orbits, it is beneficial to match the cavity shape to the bilayer graphene Fermi line contour. Conversely, a cavity of a different symmetry than the material dispersion allows one to determine preferred emission directionalities in the emitted far-field.</description>

      <title>Structure, control, and dynamics of altermagnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological theory of altermagnets, that captures their unique magnetization dynamics and allows modelling magnetic textures in this new magnetic phase. Focusing on the prototypical d-wave altermagnets, e.g. RuO$_2$, we can explain intuitively the characteristic lifted degeneracy of their magnon spectra, by the emergence of an effective sublattice-dependent anisotropic spin stiffness arising naturally from the phenomenological theory. We show that as a consequence the altermagnetic domain walls, in contrast to antiferromagnets, have a finite gradient of the magnetization, with its strength and gradient direction connected to the altermagnetic anisotropy, even for 180$^\circ$ domain walls. This gradient generates a ponderomotive force in the domain wall in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous external magnetic field, which may be achieved through magnetic force microscopy techniques. The motion of these altermagentic domain walls is also characterized by an anisotropic Walker breakdown, with much higher speed limits of propagation than ferromagnets but lower than antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Spin and Orbital Magnetism by Light in Rutile Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the understanding of altermagnetism is still at a very early stage, it is expected to play a role in various fields of condensed matter research, for example spintronics, caloritronics and superconductivity. In the field of optical magnetism, it is still unclear to which extent altermagnets as a class can exhibit a distinct behavior. Here we choose RuO$_2$, a prototype metallic altermagnet with a giant spin splitting, and CoF$_2$, an experimentally known insulating altermagnet, to study the light-induced magnetism in rutile altermagnets from first-principles. We demonstrate that in the non-relativisic limit the allowed sublattice-resolved orbital response exhibits symmetries, imposed by altermagnetism, which lead to a drastic canting of light-induced moments. On the other hand, we find that inclusion of spin-orbit interaction enhances the overall effect drastically, introduces a significant anisotropy with respect to the light polarization and strongly suppresses the canting of induced moments. Remarkably, we observe that the moments induced by linearly-polarized laser pulses in light altermagnets can even exceed in magnitude those predicted for heavy ferromagnets exposed to circularly polarized light. By resorting to microscopic tools we interpret our results in terms of the altermagnetic spin splittings and of their reciprocal space distribution. Based on our findings, we speculate that optical excitations may provide a unique tool to switch and probe the magnetic state of rutile altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent charge and heat transport through periodically driven nanodevices provide a platform for studying thermoelectric effects on the nanoscale. Here we study a junction comprising a quantum dot connected to two fermionic terminals by two weak links. An AC electric field induces time-dependent spin-orbit interaction in the weak links. We show that this setup supports DC charge and heat currents and that thermoelectric performance can be improved, as reflected by the effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the Seebeck coefficient and the electronic thermal conductance. Our analysis is based on the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green's function formalism in the time domain and reveals an interesting distribution of the power supply from the AC source among the various components of the device, apparently not realized before.</description>

Abstract: A tomographic study of near-field radiative heat exchanges between a mesoscopic object and a substrate immersed in a thermal bath is carried out within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. By using the discrete-dipole-approximation method, we compute the power density distribution for radiative exchanges and highlight the major role played by many-body interactions in these transfers. Additionally, we emphasize the close relationship between power distribution and eigenmodes within the solid paving the way to applications for hot-spot targeting at deep sub-wavelength scale by shape optimization.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Lieb superlattices: from the discrete to the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lieb lattice is one of the simplest lattices that exhibits both linear Dirac-like and flat topological electronic bands. We propose to further tailor its electronic properties through periodic 1D electrostatic superlattices (SLs), which, in the long wavelength limit, were predicted to give rise to novel transport signatures, such as the omnidirectional super-Klein tunnelling (SKT). By numerically modelling the electronic structure at tight-binding level, we uncover the evolution of the Lieb SL band structure from the discrete all the way to the continuum regime and build a comprehensive picture of the Lieb lattice under 1D potentials. This approach allows us to also take into consideration the discrete lattice symmetry-breaking that occurs at the well/barrier interfaces created by the 1D SL, whose consequences cannot be explored using the previous low energy and long wavelength approaches. We find novel features in the band structure, among which are intersections of quadratic and flat bands, tilted Dirac cones, or series of additional anisotropic Dirac cones at energies where the SKT is predicted. Such features are relevant to experimental realizations of electronic transport in Lieb 1D SL realized in artificial lattices or in real material systems like 2D covalent organic/metal-organic frameworks and inorganic 2D solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) measurements are performed with sub-nanometer spatial resolution on individual molecules decoupled from a metallic substrate by a thin NaCl layer. TEPL spectra reveal progressive fluorescence quenching with decreasing tip-molecule distance when electrons tunneling from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope are injected at resonance with the molecular states. Rate equations based on a many-body model reveal that the luminescence quenching is due to a progressive population inversion between the ground neutral (S$_0$) and the ground charge ($D_0^-$) states of the molecule occurring when the current is raised. We demonstrate that both the bias voltage and the atomic-scale lateral position of the tip can be used to gate the molecular emission. Our approach can in principle be applied to any molecular system, providing unprecedented control over the fluorescence of a single molecule.</description>

      <title>Electron screening and strength of long-range Coulomb interactions in phosphorene: From bulk to nanoribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental observations of anisotropic tightly bound excitons in black phosphorene, and correlated phenomena such as room temperature magnetically active edges in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), sparked discussions on the controversial screening of the Coulomb interaction in phosphorene-based materials. In this way, we investigate the first-principles electronic screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction in phosphorene from bulk to nanoribbon by employing ab initio calculations in conjunction with the constrained random-phase approximation. The bands near Fermi energy (E_F) are predominantly pz orbital characters, and due to the puckering, they are not well separated from the other bands with s, px, and specially py characters. This proximity in energy levels increases the contribution of px/py $\rightarrow$ pz transitions to the polarization function and significantly alters the Coulomb parameters. In semiconducting systems, the on-site Coulomb interaction values (Hubbard U) range from 4.1 to 6.5 eV and depend on the correlated subspace, electronic structure, nanoribbon's width, and edge passivation. Our long-range interaction has revealed a non-conventional screening in semiconducting nanoribbons. We have discovered that screening actually enhances the electron-hole interaction for separations larger than a critical distance r_c, which is contrary to what was previously seen in conventional semiconductors. In unpassivated zigzag nanoribbons, due to a metallic screening channel stemming from quasi-flat edge bands at E_F, we find U/W_b &gt; 1 (the bandwidth W_b) and large gradient of inter-site Coulomb interactions, making them correlated materials. We have investigated the instability of the paramagnetic state of bare ZPNRs toward ferromagnetism using a Stoner model based on the calculated Hubbard U parameters.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Raman Response in 2D Magnetic FeTe under Uniaxial Strain: Tetragonal and Hexagonal Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Fe-chalcogenides have emerged with rich structures, magnetisms and superconductivities, which sparked the growing research interests in the torturous transition mechanism and tunable properties for their potential applications in nanoelectronics. Uniaxial strain can produce a lattice distortion to study symmetry breaking induced exotic properties in 2D magnets. Herein, the anomalous Raman spectrum of 2D tetragonal (t-) and hexagonal (h-) FeTe were systematically investigated via uniaxial strain engineering strategy. We found that both t- and h-FeTe keep the structural stability under different uniaxial tensile or compressive strain up to +/- 0.4%. Intriguingly, the lattice vibrations along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions exceptionally hardened (softened) under tensile (compressive) strain, distinguished from the behaviors of many conventional 2D systems. Furthermore, the difference in thickness-dependent strain effect can be well explained by their structural discrepancy between two polymorphs of FeTe. Our results could provide a unique platform to elaborate the vibrational properties of many novel 2D materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light carries momentum and, upon interaction with material structures, can exert forces on them. Here, we show that a planar structure with asymmetric optical response is spontaneously accelerated when placed in an environment at a different temperature. This phenomenon originates from the imbalance in the exchange rates of photons between both sides of the structure and the environment. Using a simple theoretical model, we calculate the force acting on the planar structure and its terminal velocity in vacuum, and analyze their dependence on the initial temperature and the geometrical properties of the system for different realistic materials. Our results unravel an alternative approach to manipulating objects in the nano and microscale that does not require an external source of radiation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases which, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

Abstract: Recently introduced magnetic materials called altermagnets (AM) feature zero net magnetization but a momentum dependent magnetic exchange field, which can have intriguing implications when combined with superconductivity. In our work, we use the quasiclassical framework to study the effects of such a material on a conventional superconductor (S) in an AM/S bilayer. We discuss the superconducting phase diagram and heat capacity of AM/S while making a comparison with a ferromagnet-superconductor bilayer. Furthermore, we examine the density of states and analyze the system's response to an external magnetic field. We illustrate the anisotropy of spin-susceptibility and magnetization of AM/S by considering an external field in the in-plane and out-of-plane direction, thereby facilitating the scope of experimental detection and characterization of an AM in an AM/S hybrid system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic metals taking into account the presence of substrate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We consider the altermagnet bandstructure using a 2D band Hamiltonian near the $\Gamma$ point under external magnetic field. It is shown that time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to altermagnetism, together with Rashba coupling and external magnetic field, can result in non-trivial band topology. The topological phases can be tuned by magnetic field strength and directions, and are classified by their Chern numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the charge response by computing the full optical conductivity tensor with and without magnetic field. In particular, we focus on magneto-optical responses, which are the finite-frequency analog of the Berry curvature-induced anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, using experimentally realistic parameters for RuO$_2$, we estimate the Faraday angle in the absence of magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the factors influencing the lifetime of electronic states in artificial quantum structures is of great significance for advancing quantum technologies. This study focuses on CO-based quantum corrals on Cu(111). Tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal a strong correlation between the size of the quantum corral and spectral width, characterized by a predominant Gaussian line shape. We attribute this dominant Gaussian-shaped lifetime broadening to the interaction of surface state electrons with the corral boundary. To further investigate this phenomenon, we constructed corrals of varying wall densities. Our findings indicate that elastic processes, such as tunneling, are more sensitive to wall density than coupling to the bulk.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of the Hat, an aperiodic monotile, has revealed novel mathematical aspects of aperiodic tilings. However, the physics of particles propagating in such a setting remains unexplored. In this work we study spectral and transport properties of a tight-binding model defined on the Hat. We find that (i) the spectral function displays striking similarities to that of graphene, including six-fold symmetry and Dirac-like features; (ii) unlike graphene, the monotile spectral function is chiral, differing for its two enantiomers; (iii) the spectrum has a macroscopic number of degenerate states at zero energy; (iv) when the magnetic flux per plaquette ($\phi$) is half of the flux quantum, zero-modes are found localized around the reflected `anti-hats'; and (v) its Hofstadter spectrum is periodic in $\phi$, unlike for other quasicrystals. Our work serves as a basis to study wave and electron propagation in possible experimental realizations of the Hat, which we suggest.</description>

      <title>The challenges of measuring spin Seebeck noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just as electronic shot noise in driven conductors results from the granularity of charge and the statistical variation in the arrival times of charge carriers, there are predictions for fundamental noise in magnon currents due to angular momentum being carried by discrete excitations. The inverse spin Hall effect as a transduction mechanism to convert spin current into charge current raises the prospect of experimental investigations of such magnon shot noise. Spin Seebeck effect measurements have demonstrated the electrical detection of thermally driven magnon currents and have been suggested as an avenue for accessing spin current fluctuations. Using spin Seebeck structures made from yttrium iron garnet on gadolinium gallium garnet, we demonstrate the technical challenges inherent in such noise measurements. While there is a small increase in voltage noise in the inverse spin Hall detector at low temperatures associated with adding a magnetic field, the dependence on field orientation implies that this is not due to magnon shot noise. We describe theoretical predictions for the expected magnitude of magnon shot noise, highlighting ambiguities that exist. Further, we show that magnon shot noise detection through the standard inverse spin Hall approach is likely impossible due to geometric factors. Implications for future attempts to measure magnon shot noise are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical Ge nanowire: exact results based on the axial Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, the transcendental equations determining the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical Ge nanowire are analytically derived. These equations are more general than that derived using the spherical approximation, and are suitable to study the growth direction dependence of the subband dispersions. The axial approximation almost gives rise to the accurate low-energy subband dispersions for high-symmetry nanowire growth directions [001] and [111]. The perturbation correction from the non-axial term is negligible for these two directions. The lowest two subband dispersions can be regarded as two shifted parabolic curves with an energy gap at $k_{z}=0$ for both growth directions [001] and [111]. At the position of the energy gap, the eigenstates for growth direction [111] are inverted in comparison with the normal eigenstates for growth direction [001]. A nanowire growth direction where the energy gap closes at $k_{z}=0$ is predicted to exist between directions [001] and [111].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model at weak interaction with the heat baths is controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling. Universality of the linear conductance versus the temperature is found for $T\lesssim T_K$, with $T_K$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent heat transfer via virtual processes yields a $\sim T^3$ behavior with destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum. As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a maximum is reached at $T\sim T_K/2$. In the presence of a bias on the qubit, the conductance makes a transition from a resonant to a broad, zero-bias peak regime. Parallels and differences are found compared to the spin-boson model in [K. Saito and T. Kato, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 214301 (2013)], where the qubit-bath coupling instead of the internal qubit-oscillator coupling rules thermal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use electrostatic force microscopy to spatially resolve random telegraph noise at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Our measurements demonstrate that two-state fluctuations are localized at interfacial traps, with bias-dependent rates and amplitudes. These two-level systems lead to correlated carrier number and mobility fluctuations with a range of characteristic timescales; taken together as an ensemble, they give rise to a $1/f$ power spectral trend. Such individual defect fluctuations at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface impair the performance and reliability of nanoscale semiconductor devices, and will be a significant source of noise in semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers. The fluctuations measured here are associated with a four-fold competition of rates, including slow two-state switching on the order of seconds and, in one state, fast switching on the order of nanoseconds which is associated with energy loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat-to-charge conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials is closely linked to the entropy per charge carrier. Thus, magnetic materials are promising building blocks for highly efficient energy harvesters, as their carrier entropy is boosted by a spin degree of freedom. In this work, we investigate how this spin entropy impacts heat-to-charge conversion in A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr. We perform simultaneous measurements of electrical conductance and thermocurrent while changing magnetic order using temperature and magnetic field as tuning parameters. We find a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric power factor around the N\'eel temperature. We further reveal that the power factor at low temperature can be increased by up to 600% upon applying a magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that the thermoelectric properties of 2D magnets can be optimized by exploiting the sizeable impact of spin entropy and confirm thermoelectric measurements as a sensitive tool to investigate subtle magnetic phase transitions in low-dimensional magnets.</description>

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity entangling operations between qubits consistently is essential for the performance of multi-qubit systems and is a crucial factor in achieving fault-tolerant quantum processors. Solid-state platforms are particularly exposed to errors due to materials-induced variability between qubits, which leads to performance inconsistencies. Here we study the errors in a spin qubit processor, tying them to their physical origins. We leverage this knowledge to demonstrate consistent and repeatable operation with above 99% fidelity of two-qubit gates in the technologically important silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot platform. We undertake a detailed study of these operations by analysing the physical errors and fidelities in multiple devices through numerous trials and extended periods to ensure that we capture the variation and the most common error types. Physical error sources include the slow nuclear and electrical noise on single qubits and contextual noise. The identification of the noise sources can be used to maintain performance within tolerance as well as inform future device fabrication. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems, and robust gates on implementing scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. These results are achieved by using three different characterization methods, we measure entangling gate fidelities ranging from 96.8% to 99.8%. Our analysis tools identify the causes of qubit degradation and offer ways understand their physical mechanisms. These results highlight both the capabilities and challenges for the scaling up of silicon spin-based qubits into full-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of the Hexagonal Lattice in Two-Dimensional Wigner Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At very low density, the electrons in a uniform electron gas spontaneously break symmetry and form a crystalline lattice called a Wigner crystal. But which type of crystal will the electrons form? We report a numerical study of the density profiles of fragments of Wigner crystals from first principles. To simulate Wigner fragments we use Clifford periodic boundary conditions and a renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential. Moreover, we show that high-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock theory becomes exact in the low-density limit. We are thus able to accurately capture the localisation in two-dimensional Wigner fragments with many electrons. No assumptions about the positions where the electrons will localise are made. The density profiles we obtain emerge naturally when we minimise the total energy of the system. We clearly observe the emergence of the hexagonal crystal structure which has been predicted to be ground-state structure of the two-dimensional Wigner crystal.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced electronic and spin topological phase transitions in monolayer bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling, ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics. We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops. Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ground states of one-dimensional dipolar lattice bosons at unit filling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed in state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>From anti-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in a dislocation-obstacle bypass: Atomistic Simulations and Theoretical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocations are the primary carriers of plasticity in metallic material. Understanding the basic mechanisms for dislocation movement is paramount to predicting the material mechanical response. Relying on atomistic simulations, we observe a transition from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior in the rate for an edge dislocation to overcome the elastic interaction with a prismatic loop in tungsten. Beyond the critical resolved shear stress, the process shows a non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the activation entropy starts to dominate, leading to a traditional Arrhenius behavior. We have computed the activation entropy analytically along the minimum energy path following Schoeck's methods [1], which capture the cross-over between anti-Arrhenius and Arrhenius domains. Also, the Projected Average Force Integrator (PAFI) [2], another simulation method to compute free energies along an initial transition path, exhibits considerable concurrence with Schoeck's formalism. We conclude that entropic effects need to be considered to understand processes involving dislocations bypassing elastic barriers close to the critical resolved shear stress. More work needs to be performed to fully understand the discrepancies between Schoeck's and PAFI results compared to molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: The critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and SUPER swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in superconductors with d-wave magnetization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a study of the interplay between the supercurrent and spin-polarization in a two-dimensional superconducting system in the presence of a d-wave symmetric antiferromagnetic exchange interaction (altermagnetism). It is demonstrated that the supercurrent exhibits a transverse contribution in the presence of both constant and momentum-dependent exchange interactions. We also discuss the analog of the Edelstein effect for such magnetic material, showing that the induced spin polarization is quadratic in the supercurrent and d-wave symmetric.</description>

      <title>Minimal Models for Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>
