      <title>Higher vortexability: zero field realization of higher Landau levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of moir\'{e} materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Superconductivity in Twisted Graphene Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group of moir\'e graphene superconductors keeps growing, and by now it contains twisted graphene multilayers and twisted double bilayers. We analyze the contribution of long range charge fluctuations in the superconductivity of twisted double graphene bilayers and helical trilayers, and compare the results to twisted bilayer graphene. We apply a diagrammatic approach which depends on a few, well known parameters. We find that the critical temperature and the order parameter differ significantly between twisted double bilayers and helical trilayers on one hand, and twisted bilayer graphene on the other. We show that this trend, consistent with experiments, can be associated to the role played by moir\'e Umklapp processes in the different systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the physics of the spin-orbit coupling at the surface of a model topological insulator: from theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction affects the band structure of topological insulators beyond the opening of an inverted gap in the bulk bands, and the understanding of its effects on the surface states is of primary importance to access the underlying physics of these exotic states. Here, we propose an $\textit{ab initio}$ approach benchmarked by pump-probe angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data to model the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the surface states of a topological insulator. The critical novelty of our approach lies in the possibility of accounting for a partial transfer of the spin-orbit coupling to the surface states, mediated by the hybridization with the surface resonance states. In topological insulators, the fraction of transferred spin-orbit coupling influences the strength of the hexagonal warping of the surface states, which we use as a telltale of the capability of our model to reproduce the experimental dispersion. The comparison between calculations and measurements, of both the unoccupied and part of the occupied Dirac cone, indicates that the fraction of spin-orbit coupling transferred to the surface states by hybridization with the resonance states is between 70% and 85% of its full atomic value. This offers a valuable insight to improve the modeling of surface state properties in topological insulators for both scientific purposes and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Signatures of magnon hydrodynamics in an atomically-thin ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong interactions between particles can lead to emergent collective excitations. These phenomena have been extensively established in electronic systems, but are also expected to occur for gases of neutral particles like spin waves, also known as magnons, in a ferromagnet. In a hydrodynamic regime where magnons are strongly interacting, they can form a slow collective density mode -- in analogy to sound waves in water -- with characteristic low-frequency signatures. While such a mode has been predicted in theory, its signatures have yet to be observed experimentally. In this work, we isolate atomically-thin sheets of ferromagnetic CrCl$_3$ where magnon interactions are strong, and develop a technique to measure its collective magnon dynamics via the quantum coherence of nearby Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We find that the thermal magnetic fluctuations generated by CrCl$_3$ exhibit an anomalous temperature-dependence, whereby fluctuations increase upon decreasing temperature. Our analysis reveals that this anomalous trend is a consequence of the damping rate of a low-energy magnon sound mode which sharpens as magnon interactions increase with increasing temperature, providing a first glimpse of the magnon hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Strongly enhanced nonlinear acoustic valley Hall effect in tilted Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently established that a nonlinear valley current could be generated through traveling a surface acoustic wave (SAW) in two-dimensional Dirac materials. So far, the SAW-driven valley currents have been attributed to warping Fermi surface or Berry phase effect. Here, we demonstrate that tilt mechanism can also lead to a nonlinear valley Hall current (VHC) when propagating SAW in materials with the tilted Dirac cone placed on a piezoelectric substrate. It's found that the nonlinear VHC exhibits a $\sin\theta$ dependence on the orientation of tilt with respect to SAW. In addition, this tilt-induced nonlinear acoustic VHC shows independence on the relaxation time, distinguishing from the contributions from the Berry phase or trigonal warping. Remarkably, the magnitude of the nonlinear acoustic VHC from tilt mechanism in the uniaxially strained graphene is two orders larger than those reported in MoS$_2$ stemmed from the Berry phase effect and the warping effect.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Decay of Collective Quantum Excitations in Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the multistream quasiparticle model of collective electron excitations is used to study the energy-density distribution of collective quantum excitations in an interacting electron gas with arbitrary degree of degeneracy. Generalized relations for the probability current and energy density distributions is obtained which reveals a new interesting quantum phenomenon of diffusive decay of pure quasiparticle states at microscopic level. The effects is studied for various cases of free quasiparticles, quasiparticle in an infinite square-well potential and half-space collective excitations. It is shown that plasmon excitations have the intrinsic tendency to decay into equilibrium state with uniform energy density spacial distribution. It is found that plasmon levels of quasipaticle in a square-well potential are unstable decaying into equilibrium state due to the fundamental property of collective excitations. The decay rates of pure plasmon states are determined analytically. Moreover, for damped quasiparticle excitations the non-vanishing probability current divergence leads to imaginary energy density resulting in damping instability of energy density dynamic. The pronounced energy density valley close to half-space boundary at low level excitations predicts attractive force close to the surface. Current research can have implications with applications in plasmonics and related fields. Current analysis can be readily generalized to include external potential and magnetic field effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of a non-benzenoid polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon, which consists of a biphenyl moiety substituted by indenyl units at the 4,4' positions, on ultra-thin sodium chloride films by tip-induced chemistry. Single-molecule characterization by scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy reveals an open-shell biradical ground state, with a peculiar electronic configuration wherein the singly-occupied molecular orbitals (SOMOs) are lower in energy than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).</description>

      <title>Quick connect scanning tunneling microscope head with nested piezoelectric coarse walkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet changing research demands, new scanning tunneling microscope (STM) features must constantly evolve. We describe the design, development, and performance of a modular plugin STM which is compact and stable. The STM head is equipped with a quick-connect socket that is matched to a universal connector plug, enabling it to be transferred between systems. This head can be introduced into a vacuum system via a load-lock and transferred to various sites equipped with the connector plug, permitting multi site STM operation. Its design allows reliable operation in a variety of experimental conditions, including a broad temperature range, ultrahigh vacuum, high magnetic fields, and closed-cycle pulse-tube cooling. The compact size of the STM is achieved by a novel nested piezoelectric coarse walker design which allows for large orthogonal travel in the X, Y, and Z directions, ideal for a studying both bulk and thin film samples ranging in size from mm to micrometers. Its stability and noise tolerance is demonstrated by achieving atomic resolution in ambient conditions on a laboratory desktop with no vibrational or acoustic isolation.</description>

      <title>Gapless Edge-Modes and Topology in the Qi-Wu-Zhang Model: A Real-Space Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological phase transition in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model is studied, with particular attention to the appearance of chiral edge-modes in the nontrivial phase. Time-reversal symmetry breaking and its role in the topological phase transition is explicitly demonstrated. An effective Hamiltonian for the topologically protected edge-modes in a finite-size system is developed. The topological phase transition is understood in terms of a global perturbation to the system which lifts the degeneracy of the edge-modes.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose an analytic criterion for parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) exactness that is applicable in any dimensions with any boundary conditions. we find that the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition identified using this method captures dynamical signatures observable in experiments, aligns with the exceptional point, and is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition, contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson Junctions and Synchronized Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AB oscillation in weak magnetic field (B&lt;1.5kG) is observed in QPC due to interference between electrons propagating along different QPC channels. We also investigate photo-induced magnetoresistance oscillation in open-regime split-gate QPC under MW irradiation. It is attributed to EMPs interfering in the QPC region. The influence of MW power, frequency and split gate voltage is discussed thoroughly. We unify the result of photoconductance at B=0 with EMP theories. We profoundly understand EMP-induced resistance oscillation together with negative photoconductance of QPC in the open regime.</description>

      <title>Superballistic flow of viscous electron fluid induced by microwave irradiation in quantum point contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the resistance oscillation of quantum point contact (QPC) under microwave (MW) radiation. What is different from the common resistance oscillation induced by edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) is that at lower magnetic field ({\omega}&gt;{\omega}_c), photoconductance is positive (negative) with weak (strong) MW radiation. This transport phenomenon is proved to be related to superballistic flow of electrons through QPC. The distinction between the regions {\omega}&gt;{\omega}_c and {\omega}&lt;{\omega}_c is attributed to different absorption rate of MW radiation. Violent absorption occurs when cyclotron orbits or current domains are destroyed in QPC region.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Transport Measurements of Lateral p-n Junctions Formed via Precise Spatial Photodoping of Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures composed of 2-dimensional (2D) materials are spatially dope in-operando to modify devices for custom functionalities, such as lateral p-n-p junctions. After optically photodoping an hBN/Graphene/hBN heterostructure, detailed magnetotransport measurements including quantum Hall transport show several clear electronic regimes. In the p+-p-p+ and n-n+-n configurations, we see clear quantization of the longitudinal resistance. Using the Landauer-Buttiker model we elucidate the nature of the electrostatic profile at the interface between the doped regions. In the p-n-p configuration, due to the heavily graded junction profile that completely separates the p- and n-Landau level edge states from interacting, an "insulating" state is observed that is not common and has not been measured in previous quantum Hall transport measurements of graphene pnJ devices in high magnetic fields. This insulating state is promising as the basis for a high-performance graphene switching device with a good ON/OFF ratio. In principle, these doping and measurement techniques can be applied to any other 2D heterostructure encapsulated within an hBN sandwich to understand the quality of the electrostatic interface between doped regions.</description>

      <title>The General Principle behind Magnetization-induced Second-Order Topological Corner States in the Kane-Mele Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general principle for realizing second-order topological corner states in the modified Kane-Mele model with magnetization. It is demonstrated that the sign of the edge Dirac mass depends on the magnetization of the edge sublattice termination. By adjusting the directions of magnetization according to the type of sublattice at the termination of two edges, a mass domain wall can be induced in the presence of topological corner states at an arbitrary position. All previous work on introducing magnetization in the Kane-Mele model to realize second-order topological corner states can be explained by the presence of the Dirac mass domain wall with opposite signs. Applying this principle, we design square-shaped and armchair-type hexagon-shaped graphene nanoflakes with edge magnetization, allowing for the emergence of second-order topological corner states. Our findings serve as a general theory, demonstrating that the realization of second-order topological corner states is not limited by boundary type or nanoflake shape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy levels and transport properties of an extended Kitaev chain with a phase gradient. It is demonstrated that the hopping phase difference can effectively induce the generation of Majorana bound states, which are located at the non-endpoint sites of the chain. The number and positions of the non-endpoint Majorana bound states can be modulated by the hopping phase difference and initial hopping phase, respectively. In addition, we propose a protocol to realize topological braiding operation by exchanging the positions of two Majorana bound states in the extended Kitaev ring. Furthermore, we also implement the braiding of any two of the multiple Majorana bound states in the extended Kitaev double rings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) shows exceptional properties, as it consists of an unprecedentedly small electron (hole) ensemble of only ~ 10 power 11 carriers per square centimeter, which is five orders of magnitude lower than in traditional superconductors. This results in an ultra-low electronic heat capacity and kinetic inductance of this truly two-dimensional SC, and provides record-breaking key parameters for a variety of quantum sensing applications, in particular in thermal sensing and single photon detection (SPD), which traditionally exploit thermal effects in nanostructured superconducting thin films. In this work, we systematically study the interaction of the superconducting state of MATBG with individual light quanta. We discover full destruction of the SC state upon absorption of a single infrared photon even in a 16 square micrometer sized device, which showcases its exceptional bolometric sensitivity. Upon voltage biasing close to its critical current, we further show that this non-optimized device can be used as a SPD, whose click-rate is proportional to the number of absorbed photons, following Poissonian statistics. Our work offers insights into the MATBG-photon interaction and shows up pathways to use low-carrier density graphene-based superconductors as a new platform for developing revolutionary new quantum devices and sensors.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Spin Glass in a two-dimensional van der Waals material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in van der Waals (vdW) materials have sparked renewed interest in the impact of dimensionality on magnetic phase transitions. While ordered magnetic phases have been demonstrated to survive in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, the quest for a spin-glass with quenched magnetic disorder in lower dimensions has proven elusive. Here we show evidence of a spin-glass emerging from randomly distributed Fe atoms in Fe3GeTe2, the first time such a state has been reported in a vdW material. AC magnetic susceptibility displays a strong frequency dependence indicative of slow spin dynamics. Additional distinctive phenomena, including ageing, chaos, and memory effects, further substantiate the existence of a glassy state. Remarkably, we find that this state persists even in single-unit-cell thick Fe3GeTe2, thereby confirming the existence of a 2D spin-glass. The formation of spin-glass states via intercalation in vdW systems allows for highly tunable spin-glass states that are otherwise difficult to realize.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced valley transport in CrBr$_3$/WSe$_2$/CrBr$_3$ van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional magnetic materials are at the forefront of the next generation of spintronic devices. The possibility to interface them with other van der Waals materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides has opened new possibilities for the observation of new and exiting physical phenomena. Here, we present a proof-of-concept valleytronic device based on CrBr$_3$-encapsulated WSe$_2$ showing an unprecedented valley splitting of $\sim 100$ meV under compressive strain of the WSe$_2$, able to be tuned by the relative magnetization of the encapsulating layers. Multiscale transport simulations performed on this device show a spin-valley current with a polarization higher than 80$\%$ than is maintained in a range of $\sim$ 0.3 V gate voltage in a field-effect transistor configuration. The impact of the stacking configuration on the valley splitting is also evaluated.</description>

      <title>Effects of AB-flux and gap on magnetic graphene quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider magnetic graphene quantum dots (MGQDs) and study the impact of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux and gap on the scattering process of electrons. Our emphasis is on the finite lifetimes of quasi-bound states arising from the interaction between electrons and the magnetic field within the dot. Initially, we calculate the scattering coefficients, scattering efficiency, and probability density by ensuring the continuity of eigenspinors at the boundary of MGQD. The results indicate that as the gap increases, the quasi-bound states reach higher maxima. We show that an increase in AB-flux leads to a generation of quasi-bound states requiring less magnetic field, and the scattering efficiency starts to take non-zero values at smaller MGQD sizes. The analysis of probability density shows that the quasi-bound states, corresponding to non-resonantly excited scattering modes, exhibit a significant improvement in the concentrated density at MGQD. The improvement is a result of reducing the diffraction phenomenon and suppressing the Klein effect through an increase in AB-flux and gap. This increases the probability of retaining the electron for a longer period of time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for manipulating characteristics of skyrmions in a CrI$_3$ monolayer using circularly polarised light is explored. The effective skyrmion-light interaction is mediated by bright excitons whose magnetization is selectively influenced by the polarization of photons. The light-induced skyrmion dynamics is illustrated by the dependencies of the skyrmion size and the skyrmion lifetime on the intensity and polarization of the incident light pulse. Two-dimensional magnets hosting excitons thus represent a promising platform for the control of topological magnetic structures by light.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Exciton-Polariton Condensate Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the electrical control of a device probing the Josephson effect in exciton-polariton (EP) condensates, which can be switched between various dynamical modes. We model the device by a four-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. All the model parameters are calculated microscopically. In particular, we obtain the polariton tunneling strength across the junction as a second-order process of electron-hole pair tunneling. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through distinctive degrees of freedom not present in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are far richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions.</description>

      <title>Graphene conductivity: Kubo model versus QFT-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three available models of graphene conductivity: a non-local Kubo model, a local model derived by Fialkovsky, and finally a non-local Quantum Field Theory based (QFT-b) model. The first two models are extensively used in the nanophotonic community. All these models are not ab-initio since they contain phenomenological parameters (like chemical potential and/or mass gap parameters), and are supposed to provide coherent results since they are derived from the same starting Hamiltonian. While we confirm that the local model is a proper limit of the non-local Kubo model, we find some inconsistencies in the QFT-b model as derived and used in literature. In particular, differently from the Kubo model, the QFT-b model does not satisfy the required Gauge invariance, and as a consequence it shows a plasma-like behavior for the interband transversal conductivity at low frequencies instead of the expected behavior (an almost constant conductivity as a function of frequency $\omega$ with a gap for frequencies $\hbar\omega &lt; \sqrt{(\hbar v_{F}q)^{2} + 4m^{2}}$). The inconsistencies of QFT-b model predictions are due to a non-correct regularization-scheme which allows for the gauge invariance violation. We show how to correctly regularize the QFT-b model in order to satisfy the gauge invariance and, once also losses are correctly included, we show that the Kubo and QFT-b model exactly coincide. Our finding can be of relevant interest for both theory predictions and experimental tests in both the nanophotonic and Casimir effect communities.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Magnetism, Ferroelectric, and Ferrovalley Multiferroic in Stacking-Dependent Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic materials have widespread of application prospects in facilitating the integration and miniaturization of nanodevices. However, it is rarely coupling between the magnetic, ferroelectric, and ferrovalley in one 2D material. Here, we propose a mechanism for manipulating magnetism, ferroelectric, and valley polarization by interlayer sliding in 2D bilayer material. Monolayer GdI2 exhibits a ferromagnetic semiconductor with the valley polarization up to 155.5 meV. More interestingly, the magnetism and valley polarization of bilayer GdI2 can be strongly coupled by sliding ferroelectricity, appearing these tunable and reversible. In addition, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of magnetic phase transition by spin Hamiltonian and electron hopping between layers. Our findings offer a new direction for investigating 2D multiferroic in the implication for next-generation electronic, valleytronic, and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single photon scattering from a chain of giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate coherent single-photon transport in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics struc- ture containing multiple giant atoms. The single-photon scattering amplitudes are solved using a real-space method. The results give rise to a clear picture of the multi-channel scattering process. In the case of identical and equally-spaced giant atoms in a separate configuration, we also use the transfer-matrix method to express the scattering amplitudes in terms of compact analytical expres- sions, which allow us to conveniently analyze the properties of the scattering spectra. Based on these theoretical results, we find that the non-dipole effects of giant atoms, which are relevant to the design of the setup, can strongly manipulate several types of collective properties of the output fields, including the superradiant phenomenon, the multiple Fano interference, and the photonic band gap. This makes it possible to manipulate the photon transport in a more versatile way than with small atoms. We also make a proposal to probe the topological states of a chain of braided giant atoms by using photon scattering spectra, showing that waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems with giant atoms are ideal platforms to merge topological physics and on-chip quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Detecting and leaking a Majorana bound state through proximity to a Kitaev ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of a Majorana bound state at one end of a Kitaev chain is unambiguously signaled by observable quantities in a nearby Kitaev ring. When the Kitaev chain is in the topological phase, the band structure of the Kitaev ring breaks chiral symmetry and the ring-Majoranas' spectral functions are even functions of momentum and energy, the latter wielding time-reversal and particle-hole symmetric occupation numbers and, hence, zero current in the ring. Driving a phase transition in the Kitaev chain (e.g., using a backgate to vary the chemical potential of the chain through its critical value), the replacement of the Majorana bound state by a trivial fermion is manifest by chiral symmetry reappearing in the band structure of the ring and by the ring-Majoranas' spectral functions loss of parity, wielding time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking in the occupation numbers and a spontaneous current in the ring. Energy resonance and maximum spectral weight exactly at the resonance energy concur for a high leakage probability between ring-Majoranas' states and the Majorana bound state, whereas the lack of energy resonance makes unlikely any leakage between ring-Majoranas' states and the trivial fermion states. The proposed setup also invites further investigations in the context of braiding and/or fusion of Majorana states, both as detection mechanisms and for quantum computing purposes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Behavior of Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum technologies and advanced detection experiments have underscored the pressing need for the detection of exceedingly weak signals within the microwave frequency spectrum. Addressing this challenge, the Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) has been proposed as a cryogenic front-end amplifier capable of approaching the quantum noise limit while providing a relevant bandwidth. This research is centered on a comprehensive numerical investigation of the JTWPA, without resorting to simplifications regarding the nonlinearity of the essential components. Specifically, this study focuses on a thorough examination of the system, characterized by coupled nonlinear differential equations representing all components of the device. Proper input and output signals at the device's boundaries are considered. The analysis of the output signals undergoing the parametric amplification process involves a detailed exploration of phase-space dynamics and Fourier spectral analysis of the output voltage. This study is conducted while considering the parameters ruling the response of the device under pump and signal excitations. In addition to the expected signal amplification, the findings reveal that the nonlinear nature of the system can give rise to unforeseen phenomena, depending on the system's operational conditions, which include: the generation of pump tone harmonics, modulation of the signal gain, and incommensurate frequency generation-effects that are not easily accommodated by simplistic linearized approaches</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedgehog and antihedgehog spin textures in magnets behave as emergent monopoles and antimonopoles, which give rise to astonishing transport and electromagnetic phenomena. Using the Kondo-lattice model in three dimensions, we theoretically study collective spin-wave excitation modes of magnetic hedgehog lattices which have recently been discovered in itinerant magnets such as MnSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ and SrFeO$_3$. It is revealed that the spin-wave modes, which appear in the sub-terahertz regime, have dominant amplitudes localized at Dirac strings connecting hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs and are characterized by their translational oscillations. It is found that their spectral features sensitively depend on the number and configuration of the Dirac strings and, thus, can be exploited for identifying the topological phase transitions associated with the monopole-antimonopole pair annihilations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing thermoelectric performance of 2D Janus ISbTe by strain engineering: A first principle study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the 2D materials laid emphasis on finding the materials with robust properties for variety of applications including the energy harvesting. The recent discovery of Janus monolayers with broken symmetry has opened up new options for engineering the properties of 2D layered materials. Present study focuses on enhancing thermoelectric properties of 2H-ISbTe 2D Janus monolayer. All the calculations have been performed using fully relaxed unit cell and employing the pseudo potential based quantum espresso code. Calculated structural parameters are in good agreement with previous literature reports. The lattice dynamics calculations predicts this monolayer can withstand a strain of up to 4% beyond which imaginary frequencies appear in the phonon dispersion curves. Computed electronic structure reveals that the monolayer is an indirect wide bandgap material and the bandgap decreases with tensile strain. Furthermore, the computed thermoelectric properties show that the studied monolayer has high Seebeck coefficient of ~ 300 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity which yields reasonably high ZT of ~ 1.31 for a strain of 2% at 300 K with p-type doping. Therefore, our study signifies the fact that tensile strain and p-type doping of 2D Janus monolayer ISbTe can enhance ZT from 0.87 to 1.31 at room temperature which makes it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorene and its components are highly reactive to oxygen when exposed to ambient conditions due to the presence of lone pairs of electrons on phosphorus atoms. Functionalization serves as a solution to prevent the chemical degradation of these materials. In this study, we investigate the impact of a rather strong covalent or non-covalent functionalization of phosphorene (monolayer Black Phosphorus (BP)), few-layer BP, and bulk BP. We use an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian that corresponds to one orbital per site, for which covalent functionalization is simulated by atomic vacancies, and non-covalent functionalization is simulated by Anderson disorder. We show that these two types of functionalisation act differently on the electronic structure and quantum diffusion, in particular on gap and mobility gap for a high degree of functionalisation.</description>

      <title>Spatially dispersing in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through single electronic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe superconducting in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through single impurity state in a low-carrier-density superconductor (NaAlSi). The energy-symmetric in-gap states appear when the impurity state is located within the superconducting gap. Superconducting in-gap states can cross the Fermi level, and show X-shaped spatial dispersion. We interpret the in-gap states as a consequence of the Andreev tunneling through the impurity state, which involves the formation or breakup of a Cooper pair. Due to the low carrier density in NaAlSi, the in-gap state is tunable by controlling the STM tip-sample distance. Under strong external magnetic fields, the impurity state shows Zeeman splitting when it is located near the Fermi level. Our findings not only demonstrate the Andreev tunneling involving single electronic state, but also provide new insights for understanding the spatially dispersing in-gap states in low-carrier-density superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin Signature of Majorana Fermions in Topological Nodal-Point Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight a situation having attracted little attention previously that in two-dimensional topological nodal superconductors, the Majorana edge states with breaking chiral symmetry but preserving nearly flat bands can have unexpected spin-singlet component of pairing correlations compared with the counterparts of exactly flat bands. Moreover, it is detectable by means of spin-selective Andreev reflection in a realistic topological nodal superconductor with antiferromagnetism, as the conductance peaks become the most outstanding when the spin polarization of incident electrons is (approximately) antiparallel to that of Majorana edge excitations. Therefore, our findings uncover another previously unexpected spin-dependent scenario for the Andreev reflection resonant peaks, and the related features constitute an important step forward in the quest for experimental detection of Majorana fermions in a system with the same kind of topological superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids offer promising platforms to investigate nuclear spin clusters with high sensitivity and atomic-site resolution. To leverage near-surface defects for molecular structure analysis in chemical and biological contexts using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), further advances in spectroscopic characterization of nuclear environments are essential. Here, we report Fourier spectroscopy techniques to improve localization and mapping of the testbed $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin environment of individual, shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers at room temperature. We use multidimensional spectroscopy, well-known from classical NMR, in combination with weak measurements of single-nuclear-spin precession. We demonstrate two examples of multidimensional NMR: (i) improved nuclear spin localization by separate encoding of the two hyperfine components along spectral dimensions and (ii) spectral editing of nuclear-spin pairs, including measurement of internuclear coupling constants. Our work adds important tools for the spectroscopic analysis of molecular structures by single-spin probes.</description>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a NM side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant - to characterize the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetals induced by quantum fluctuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kondo effect exemplifies the type of quantum fluctuations driven by strong correlations, and its cooperation with space group symmetries underlies the Weyl-Kondo semimetals. Because the Kondo effect of the $f$-electrons is believed to be suppressed in a magnetic environment, Weyl-Kondo semimetals have so far been confined to paramagnetic settings. Here we develop the theory of magnetic Weyl-Kondo semimetal. The key of the proposed mechanism is that the magnetic order is originated from the conduction $d$ electrons, such that the local moments can still fluctuate. We illustrate the extreme case where the magnetic space group symmetries prevent any magnetization on the sites with the $f$-orbitals. In this case, hourglass Weyl-Kondo nodal lines appear when the space group symmetry acts on the Kondo-driven low-energy excitations. We suggest a third-order nonlinear spontaneous Hall response as a means to diagnose this type of topological crossings. Based on the theoretical mechanism, we explore the interplay between correlations and symmetries in magnetic square-net materials, leading to several candidate materials with a variety of nonlinear Hall responses. Our findings pave the way for future experimental exploration and theoretical investigations in this new and promising materials class as a part of an overarching effort to understand and harness the interplay between strong correlations and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback-based control of nano- and micromechanical resonators can enable the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and also sensitive force measurements. Here, we demonstrate the feedback cooling of a low-loss and high-stress macroscopic SiN membrane resonator close to its quantum ground state. We use the microwave optomechanical platform, where the resonator is coupled to a microwave cavity. The experiment utilizes a Josephson travelling wave parametric amplifier, which is nearly quantum-limited in added noise, and is important to mitigate resonator heating due to system noise in the feedback loop. We reach a thermal phonon number as low as 1.6, which is limited primarily by microwave-induced heating. We also discuss the sideband asymmetry observed when a weak microwave tone for independent readout is applied in addition to other tones used for the cooling. The asymmetry can be qualitatively attributed to the quantum-mechanical imbalance between emission and absorption. However, we find that the observed asymmetry is only partially due to this quantum effect. In specific situations, the asymmetry is fully dominated by a cavity Kerr effect under multitone irradiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted graphene based moir\'e heterostructures host a flat band at the magic angles where the kinetic energy of the charge carriers is quenched and interaction effects dominate. This results in emergent phases such as superconductors and correlated insulators that are electrostatically tunable. We investigate superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) by integrating it as the weak link in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The measured current phase relation (CPR) yields a large and tunable kinetic inductance, up to 150 nH per square, of the electron and hole type intrinsic superconductors. We further show that the specific kinetic inductance and the critical current density are universally related via the superconducting coherence length, and extract an upper bound of 200 nm for the coherence length. Our work opens avenues for using graphene-based superconductors as tunable elements in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Drain Noise in High Electron Mobility Transistors: Thermal and Hot Electron Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the on-wafer characterization of $S$-parameters and microwave noise temperature ($T_{50}$) of discrete metamorphic InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (mHEMTs) at 40 K and 300 K and over a range of drain-source voltages ($V_{DS}$). From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain (output) noise current power spectral density ($S_{id}$) at each bias and temperature. This procedure enables $S_{id}$ to be obtained while accounting for the variation of small-signal model, noise impedance match, and other parameters under the various conditions. We find that the thermal noise associated with the channel conductance can only account for a portion of the measured output noise. Considering the variation of output noise with physical temperature and bias and prior studies of microwave noise in quantum wells, we hypothesize that a hot electron noise source based on real-space transfer of electrons from the channel to the barrier could account for the remaining portion of $S_{id}$. We suggest further studies to gain insights into the physical mechanisms. Finally, we calculate that the minimum HEMT noise temperature could be reduced by up to $\sim 50$% and $\sim 30$% at cryogenic temperature and room temperature, respectively, if the hot electron noise could be suppressed.</description>

Abstract: Understanding fluctuation phenomena plays a dominant role in the development of many-body physics. The time evolution of entanglement is essential to a broad range of subjects in many-body physics, ranging from exotic quantum matter to quantum thermalization. Stemming from various dynamical processes of information, fluctuations in entanglement evolution differ conceptually from out-of-equilibrium fluctuations of traditional physical quantities. Their studies remain elusive. Here we uncover an emergent random structure in the evolution of the many-body wavefunction in two classes of integrable -- either interacting or noninteracting -- lattice models. It gives rise to out-of-equilibrium entanglement fluctuations which fall into the paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations of wave interference origin. Specifically, the entanglement entropy variance obeys a universal scaling law, in each class, and the full distribution displays a sub-Gaussian upper and a sub-Gamma lower tail. These statistics are independent of both the system's microscopic details and the choice of entanglement probes, and broaden the class of mesoscopic universalities. They have practical implications for controlling entanglement in mesoscopic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15945v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering dynamics influence the graphenes transport properties and inhibits the charge carrier deterministic behaviour. The intra or inter-band scattering mechanisms are vital for graphenes optical conductivity response under specific considerations of doping. Here, we investigated the influence of scattering systematically on optical conductivity using a semi-classical multiband Boltzmann equation with inclusion of both electron-electron $\&amp;$ electron-phonon collisions. We found unconventional characteristics of linear optical response with a significant deviation from the universal conductivity $\frac{e^2}{4\hbar}$ in doped monolayer graphene. This is explained through phenomenological relaxation rates under low doping regime with dominant intraband scattering. Such novel optical responses are vanished at high temperatures or overdoping conditions due to strong Drude behaviour. With the aid of approximations around Dirac points we have developed analytical formalism for many body interactions and is in good agreement with the Kubo approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

Abstract: The out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir-Polder force between nanoparticles and dielectric substrates coated with gapped graphene is considered in the framework of the Dirac model using the formalism of the polarization tensor. This is an example of physical phenomena violating the time-reversal symmetry. After presenting the main points of the used formalism, we calculate two contributions to the Casimir-Polder force acting on a nanoparticle on the source side of a fused silica glass substrate coated with gapped graphene, which is either cooler or hotter than the environment. The total nonequilibrium force magnitudes are computed as a function of separation for different values of the energy gap and compared with those from an uncoated plate and with the equilibrium force in the presence of graphene coating. According to our results, the presence of a substrate increases the magnitude of the nonequlibrium force. The force magnitude becomes larger with higher and smaller with lower temperature of the graphene-coated substrate as compared to the equilibrium force at the environmental temperature. It is shown that with increasing energy gap the magnitude of the nonequilibrium force becomes smaller, and the graphene coating makes a lesser impact on the force acting on a nanoparticle from the uncoated substrate. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of atomic reconstruction on optical spectra of twisted TMD homobilayers</title>

Abstract: Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have revealed a rich exciton landscape including hybrid excitons and spatially trapped moir\'e excitons that dominate the optical response of the material. Recent studies have shown that in the low-twist-angle regime, the lattice undergoes a significant relaxation in order to minimize local stacking energies. Here, large domains of low energy stacking configurations emerge, deforming the crystal lattices via strain and consequently impacting the electronic band structure. However, so far the direct impact of atomic reconstruction on the exciton energy landscape and the optical properties has not been well understood. Here, we apply a microscopic and material-specific approach and predict a significant change in the potential depth for moir\'e excitons in a reconstructed lattice, with the most drastic change occurring in naturally stacked TMD homobilayers. We show the appearance of multiple flat bands and a significant change in the position of trapping sites compared to the rigid lattice. Most importantly, we predict a multi-peak structure emerging in optical absorption of WSe$_2$ homobilayers - in contrast to the single peak that dominates the rigid lattice. This finding can be exploited as an unambiguous signature of atomic reconstruction in optical spectra of moir\'e excitons in naturally stacked twisted homobilayers.</description>

Abstract: The electronic structure of atoms is organized into even and odd-parity-wave s, p, d, ... orbitals. An analogous classification of condensed matter phases emerged with the discovery of conventional s-wave superconductivity in mercury, followed by the discoveries of unconventional p-wave superfluidity in $^{3}$He and unconventional d-wave superconductivity in cuprates. To date, the known counterparts in magnetism have been the conventional ferromagnets with s-wave spin polarization in the electronic structure, and the recently discovered altermagnets[1-3] with unconventional d-wave and higher even-parity wave spin polarization[1,2,4-7]. Here we identify the long-sought magnetic counterpart of unconventional p-wave superfluidity[8,9] -- the unconventional magnet with p-wave spin polarization[10,11]. We show that that collinear p-wave spin-polarization arises in a coplanar spin-symmetry subset of a class of noncentrosymmetric and noncolinear magnetic crystals with combined time-reversal and lattice translation symmetry. Contrary to common assumptions[12-15], we show that noncollinear magnets from this class universally exhibit nonrelativistic spin splittings and that these odd-parity wave spin splittings preserve time-reversal symmetry of the band structure. We predict large spin splitings reaching 500 meV by first-principles calculations and we identify 60 realistic material candidates. Inspired by the rich and anisotropic properties of superfluid $^{3}$He[8,9] our result opens up a wide range of possibilities to investigate unconventional p-wave order parameters in crystals and their exploitation in spintronics and topological physics[16-21].</description>

Abstract: Topological semimetals, such as the Weyl and Dirac semimetals, represent one of the most active research fields in modern condensed matter physics. The peculiar physical properties of these systems mainly originate from their underlying symmetries, emergent relativistic dispersion, and band topology. In this paper, we present a novel class of $\textit{geometric semimetals}$ in three dimensions. These semimetals are protected by the generalized chiral and rotation symmetries, but are topologically trivial. Nevertheless, we show that their band geometry is nontrivial, as evidenced by the nonzero quantum metric trace with possible quantization. The possible realization in synthetic-matter experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Charge Conservation Beyond Uniformity: Spatially Inhomogeneous Electromagnetic Response in Periodic Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear electromagnetic response functions have reemerged as a crucial tool for studying quantum materials. Most attention has been paid to responses to spatially uniform electric fields, relevant to optical experiments in conventional materials. However, magnetic and magnetoelectric phenomena are naturally connected by responses to spatially varying electric fields due to Maxwell's equations. Furthermore, in moir\'{e} materials, characteristic lattice scales are much longer, allowing spatial variation of optical electric fields to potentially have a measurable effect in experiments. To address these issues, we develop a formalism for computing linear and nonlinear responses to spatially inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields. Starting with the continuity equation, we derive an expression for the current operator that is manifestly conserved and model independent. Crucially, our formalism makes no assumptions on the form of the microscopic Hamiltonian and so is applicable to model Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding or ab initio calculations. We then develop a diagrammatic Kubo formalism for computing the wavevector dependence of linear and nonlinear conductivities, using Ward identities to fix the value of the diamagnetic current order-by-order in the vector potential. We apply our formula to compute the magnitude of the Kerr effect at oblique incidence for a model of a moir\'{e} Chern insulator and demonstrate the experimental relevance of spatially inhomogeneous fields in these systems. We further show how our formalism allows us to compute the magnetic multipole moments and magnetic susceptibility in insulators. We next use our formalism to compute the second-order transverse response to spatially varying transverse electric fields in our moir\'{e} Chern insulator model, with an eye towards the next generation of experiments in these systems.</description>

We discuss the impact of spin-orbit coupling in the quantum Hall system and the possibility of effectively inducing triplet pairing in the egde states. We show that the presence of these correlations imprints very clear signatures in both the non-linear conductance and noise in these type of devices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of the Periodic Anderson Hamiltonian of Samarium Hexaboride</title>

Abstract: The periodic Anderson Hamiltonian of the bulk samarium hexaboride is investigated in this article assuming the presence of ferromagnetic impurities (FM). The problem of large on-site electron-electron repulsion is reformulated in terms of a holonomic constraint using slave-boson technique. The model analysis yields the effective mass of electron and the possibility of the quantum anomalous Hall phase with integer value of the Chern number. Upon using the Fu-Kane-Mele formalism, it is indicated that the surface Hamiltonian without FM may correspond to a strong topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Current-induced spin polarization in chiral Tellurium: a first-principles quantum transport study</title>

Abstract: Te is a naturally p-doped semiconductor with a chiral structure, where an electrical current causes the conduction electrons to become spin polarized parallel to the transport direction. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of this effect by employing density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) technique for quantum transport. We suggest that the spin polarization can quantitatively be estimated in terms of two complementary quantities, namely the non-equilibrium magnetic moments and the spin current density. The calculated magnetic moments are directly compared with the values from previous theoretical studies obtaining overall consistent results. On the other hand, the inspection of the spin current density provides insights of the magnetotransport properties of the material. Specifically, we predict that the resistance along a Te wire changes when an external magnetic field is applied parallel or antiparallel to the charge current direction. The computed magnetoresistance is however quite small (~ 0.025%). Finally, we show that the description of the current-induced spin polarization in terms of the spin current establishes a straightforward connection with the phenomenon called chiral-induced spin selectivity, recently observed in several nano-junctions.</description>

      <title>Random Green's function method for large-scale electronic structure calculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling random Green's function (rGF) method for large-scale electronic structure calculation. In this method, the rGF is defined on a set of random states to stochastically express the density matrix, and rGF is calculated with the linear-scaling computational cost. We show the rGF method is generally applicable to the nonorthogonal localized basis, and circumvent the large Chebyshev expansion for the density matrix. As a demonstration, we implement rGF with density-functional Tight-Binding method and apply it to self-consistently calculate water clusters up 9984 H2Os. We find the rGF method combining with a simple fragment correction can reach an error of ~1meV per H2O in total energy, compared to the deterministic calculations, due to the self-average. The development of rGF method advances the stochastic electronic structure theory to a new stage of the efficiency and applicability.</description>

Abstract: One of the fundamental facts of condensed matter physics is that sufficient amount of disorder always turns a Fermi liquid metal into an Anderson insulator: a compressible, but non-conducting phase of matter. Recently, topological semimetals have emerged as another way a metallic phase may be realized. In this paper we point out that, unlike ordinary metals, at least some topological semimetals are immune to localization, provided certain conditions are satisfied. We present several physical arguments, based on diagrammatic perturbation theory and Keldysh field theory, as well as domain wall network construction, to back up this claim.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dots are semiconductor nano-structures where particle motion is confined in all three spatial dimensions. Since their first experimental realization, nanocrystals confining the quanta of polarization waves, termed excitons, have found numerous applications in fields ranging from single photon sources for quantum information processing to commercial displays. A major limitation to further extending the range of potential applications has been the large inhomogeneity in, and lack-of tunability of, exciton energy that is generic to quantum dot materials. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating electrically-defined quantum dots for excitons in monolayer semiconductors where the discrete exciton energies can be tuned using applied gate voltages. Resonance fluorescence measurements show strong spectral jumps and blinking of these resonances, verifying their zero-dimensional nature. Our work paves the way for realizing quantum confined bosonic modes where nonlinear response would arise exclusively from exciton--exciton interactions.</description>

      <title>Aharonov-Bohm effect for confined matter in lattice gauge theories</title>

Abstract: Gauge theories arise in physical systems displaying space-time local symmetries. They provide a powerful description of important realms of physics ranging from fundamental interactions, to statistical mechanics, condensed matter and more recently quantum computation. As such, a remarkably deep understanding has been achieved in the field. With the advent of quantum technology, lower energy analogs, capable to capture important features of the original quantum field theories through quantum simulation, have been intensively studied. Here, we propose a specific scheme implementing an analogic quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories constrained to mesoscopic spatial scales. To this end, we study the dynamics of mesons residing in a ring-shaped lattice of mesoscopic size pierced by an effective magnetic field. In particular, we find a new type of Aharonov-Bohm effect that goes beyond the particle-like effect and reflecting the the features of the confining gauge potential. The coherence properties of the meson are quantified by the persistent current and by specific features of the correlation functions. When the magnetic field is quenched, Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and correlations start a specific matter-wave current dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson impurity model is a paradigmatic example in the study of strongly correlated quantum systems and describes an interacting quantum dot coupled to electronic leads. In this work, we characterize the emergence of the Kondo effect by investigating the model dynamics following a quantum quench based on matrix product state simulations. The relaxation of the impurity magnetization allows for the estimate of the predicted universal scaling of the Kondo temperature as a function of the impurity-lead hybridization and quantum dot repulsion. Additionally, our simulations permit us to evaluate the current in the nonequilibrium quasi-steady state appearing after the quench. Through their values, we examine the dependence of the conductance on the voltage bias $V_b$ and on the impurity chemical potential $V_g$, which displays a zero-bias Kondo peak. Our results are relevant for transport measurements in Coulomb blockaded devices, and, in particular, in quantum dots induced in nanowires.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of bounds in the correlations of fractional quantum Hall states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically compute the guiding center static structure factor $\bar S(\bf k)$ of various fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states to $\mathcal{O}\left((k\ell)^6\right)$ where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\ell$ is the magnetic length. Employing density matrix renormalization group on an infinite cylinder of circumference $L_y$, we study the two-dimensional limit using $L_y/\xi \gg 1$, where $\xi$ is the correlation length. The main findings of our work are: 1) the ground states that deviate away from the ideal conformal block wavefunctions, do not saturate the Haldane bound, and 2) the coefficient of $O\left((k\ell)^6\right)$ term appears to be bounded above by a value predicted by field theories proposed in the literature. The first finding implies that the graviton mode is not maximally chiral for experimentally relevant FQH states.</description>

      <title>Dark matter detection using nuclear magnetization in magnet with hyperfine interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility to detect cosmic light dark matter (DM), i.e., axions and dark photons, of mass $\sim 10^{-6}$ eV and $\sim 10^{-4}$ eV, by magnetic excitation in a magnet with strong hyperfine interaction. In particular, we consider a canted anti-ferromagnet, MnCO$_3$, as a concrete candidate material. With spin transfer between nuclear and electron spins allowed by the hyperfine interaction, nuclear spins become naturally highly polarized due to an effective (electron-spin-induced) magnetic field, and have long-range interactions with each other. The collective precession of nuclear spins, i.e., a nuclear magnon, can be generated by the DM field through the nucleon-DM interaction, while they are also sensitive to the electron-DM interaction through the electron-nuclear spin mixing. Compared with conventional nuclear-spin precession experiments, this system as a DM sensor is sensitive to higher frequency needing only a small static magnetic field applied. The system also has collective precession of electron spins, mixed with nuclear spins, as the additional channels that can be used for DM probes. We estimate the sensitivity under appropriate readout setups such as an inductive pick-up loop associated with an LC resonant circuit, or a photon cavity with a photon counting device. We show that this method covers an unexplored parameter region of light bosonic DM.</description>

      <title>The confluence of fractured resonances at points of dynamical, many--body flare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant transport occurs when there is a matching of frequencies across some spatial medium, increasing the efficiency of shuttling particles from one reservoir to another. We demonstrate that in a periodically driven, many--body titled lattice, there are sets of spatially fractured resonances. These ``emanate'' from two essential resonances due to scattering off internal surfaces created when the driving frequency and many--body interaction strength vary, a scattering reminiscent of lens flare. The confluence of these fractured resonances dramatically enhances transport. At one confluence, the interaction strength is finite and the essential resonance arises due to the interplay of interaction with the counter--rotating terms of the periodic drive. We discuss the origin and structure of the fractured resonances, as well as the scaling of the conductance with system parameters. These results furnish a new example of the richness of open, driven, many--body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stacking ferroelectricity (SFE) has been discovered in a wide range of van der Waals materials and holds promise for applications, including photovoltaics and high-density memory devices. We show that the microscopic origin of out-of-plane stacking ferroelectric polarization can be generally understood as a consequence of nontrivial Berry phase borne out of an effective Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model description with broken sublattice symmetry, thus elucidating the quantum-geometric origin of polarization in the extremely non-periodic bilayer limit. Our theory applies to known stacking ferroelectrics such as bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in 3R and T$_{\rm d}$ phases, as well as general AB-stacked honeycomb bilayers with staggered sublattice potential. Our explanatory and self-consistent framework based on the quantum-geometric perspective establishes quantitative understanding of out-of-plane SFE materials beyond symmetry principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultraflat bands have already been detected in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, which provide a platform to investigate strong correlations. In this paper, the electronic properties of twisted trilayer molybdenum disulfide (TTM) are investigated via an accurate tight-binding Hamiltonian. We find that the highest valence bands are derived from the $\Gamma$-point of the constituent monolayer, and they exhibit a graphenelike dispersion or become isolated flat bands that are dependent on the starting stacking arrangements. The lattice relaxation, local deformation, and external fields can significantly tune the electronic structures of TTM. After introducing the spin-orbital coupling effect, we find a spin-valley-layer locking effect at the minimum of the conduction band at the $K$- and $K^\prime$-point of the Brillouin zone, which may provide a platform to study optical properties and magnetoelectric effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopies and magnetic measurements were used to explore the correlated changes of the structure, lattice dynamics and magnetic properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles, which appear in dependence on their sintering temperature. We revealed a gradual substitution of the hexagonal phase by the orthorhombic phase in the nanoparticles, which sintering temperature increases from 700 C to 1100 C. The origin and stability of the hexagonal phase in the LuFeO3 nanoparticles is of the special interest, because the nanoparticle in the phase can be a room-temperature multiferroic with a weak ferromagnetic and pronounced structural and ferroelectric long-range ordering, while the antiferromagnetic and nonpolar orthorhombic phase is more stable in the bulk LuFeO3. To define the ranges of the hexagonal phase stability, we determine the bulk and interface energy densities of different phases from the comparison of the Gibbs model with experimental results. Using the Gibbs model parameters, we predict the influence of size effects and temperature on the structural and polar properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles. Analysis of the obtained results shows that the combination of the X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and theoretical modelling of structural and polar properties allows to establish the interplay between the phase composition, lattice dynamics and multiferroic properties of the LuFeO3 nanoparticles prepared in different conditions.</description>

Abstract: Scalable quantum processors require high-fidelity universal quantum logic operations in a manufacturable physical platform. Donors in silicon provide atomic size, excellent quantum coherence and compatibility with standard semiconductor processing, but no entanglement between donor-bound electron spins has been demonstrated to date. Here we present the experimental demonstration and tomography of universal 1- and 2-qubit gates in a system of two weakly exchange-coupled electrons, bound to single phosphorus donors introduced in silicon by ion implantation. We surprisingly observe that the exchange interaction has no effect on the qubit coherence. We quantify the fidelity of the quantum operations using gate set tomography (GST), and we use the universal gate set to create entangled Bell states of the electrons spins, with fidelity ~ 93%, and concurrence 0.91 +/- 0.08. These results form the necessary basis for scaling up donor-based quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a spectral-averaging procedure that enables computation of bandwidth-integrated local density of states (LDOS) from a single scattering calculation, and exploit it to investigate the minimum extinction achievable from dipolar sources over finite bandwidths in structured media. Structure-agnostic extinction bounds are derived, providing analytical insights into scaling laws and fundamental design tradeoffs with implications to bandwidth and material selection. We find that perfect LDOS suppression over a finite bandwidth $\Delta\omega$ is impossible. Inspired by limits which predict nontrivial $\sqrt{\Delta\omega}$ scaling in systems with material dissipation, we show that pseudogap edge states of quasi-1d bullseye gratings can -- by simultaneously minimizing material absorption and radiation -- yield arbitrarily close to perfect LDOS suppression in the limit of vanishing bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Surface Luttinger surfaces and Luttinger-Lifshitz transitions in topological band structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that the surface two phases with the same symmetries are necessarily separated by a bulk phase transition, while breaking the symmetry unlocks a path in parameter space that allows the phases to be connected adiabatically. Moreover, if the symmetry is broken only on the boundary, single-particle properties are expected to be blind to distinction between the two phases. In this work, we prove that this expectation is incorrect. We first reveal that the single-particle \emph{surface} Green's function contains zeros or ``LSs'' that respect the same bulk-boundary correspondence that the well-known topological surface states do. At non-zero temperatures, these modes contribute negatively to an effective surface specific heat. Remarkably, the LSs survive symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Thus, a bulk topological phase transition causes a reconstruction of Luttinger surfaces on the surface and manifests as a discontinuity in the surface specific heat.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can be driven into an insulating state by coupling to a charge density wave (CDW) order. Here, we consider the quantized crystalline responses of such charge-ordered Dirac semimetals, which we dub Dirac-CDW insulators, in which charge is bound to disclination defects of the lattice. Using analytic and numeric methods we show the following. First, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate, disclination-line defects of the lattice have a quantized charge per length. Second, when the CDW is inversion-symmetric, disclinations of the lattice have a quantized electric polarization. Third, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate and inversion-symmetric, disclinations are characterized by a "disclination filling anomaly" -- a quantized difference in the total charge bound to disclination-lines of Dirac-CDW with open and periodic boundaries. We construct an effective response theory that captures the topological responses of the Dirac-CDW insulators in terms of a total derivative term, denoted the $R\wedge F$ term. The $R\wedge F$ term describes the crystalline analog of the axion electrodynamics that are found in Weyl semimetal-CDW insulators. We also use the crystalline responses and corresponding response theories to classify the strongly correlated topological phases of three-dimensions Dirac-semimetals.</description>
