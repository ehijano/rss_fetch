      <title>The Evolution of Altruistic Rationality Provides a Solution to Social Dilemmas via Rational Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades of scientific inquiry have sought to understand how evolution fosters cooperation, a concept seemingly at odds with the belief that evolution should produce rational, self-interested individuals. Most previous work has focused on the evolution of cooperation among boundedly rational individuals whose decisions are governed by behavioral rules that do not need to be rational. Here, using an evolutionary model, we study how altruism can evolve in a community of rational agents and promote cooperation. We show that in both well-mixed and structured populations, a population of objectively rational agents is readily invaded by mutant individuals who make rational decisions but evolve a distorted (i.e., subjective) perception of their payoffs. This promotes behavioral diversity and gives rise to the evolution of rational, other-regarding agents who naturally solve all the known strategic problems of two-person, two-strategy games by perceiving their games as pure coordination games.</description>

      <title>Sustainability, behavior patterns and crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability has been defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. But what are the needs of the present? And are they met? From the poor performance of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), defined by the UN in 2015, not even the collective needs of the present seem to be met. How to expect not to compromise the needs of the future? Is the achievement of global world goals incompatible with the characteristic processes of human evolution, as some authors have recently suggested? Simple mathematical models cannot capture the whole breadth of human experience and destiny. But, on the other hand, one should not neglect whatever insights they may provide. And what these models teach us is how the behavior pattern "Parochial cooperation - Conflict - Growth" was reached and how this pattern, in addition to leading to several types of crises, is also on the way of the global governance needed to achieve the SDG's</description>

      <title>The Cognate Data Bottleneck in Language Phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.</description>

      <title>Flow spatial structure determines pattern instabilities in nonlocal models of population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how environmental flows influence spatial pattern formation and population dynamics using two nonlocal models of population dynamics, which we couple to two different stationary flows. Combining numerical simulations and analytical approximations, we show that the spatial structure of the flow's velocity field determines the pattern formation instability. For a simple shear flow, where one of the primary axes of the population pattern can become aligned with the flow, the onset of pattern formation remains unaffected. In contrast, a vortex flow delays the pattern instability relative to the no-flow case. The velocity field, therefore, interacts with the spatial feedbacks responsible for pattern formation in complex ways, which also leads to different oscillatory time series of population abundance. In some cases, the population undergoes regular oscillations with a characteristic frequency, while in others, the dynamics exhibits long erratic transients with no well-defined period before settling into a more regular behavior.</description>

      <title>Phenotypic heterogeneity in temporally fluctuating environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological systems regulate phenotypic heterogeneity as a fitness-maximising strategy in uncertain and dynamic environments. Analysis of such strategies is typically confined both to a discrete set of environmental conditions, and to a discrete (often binary) set of phenotypes specialised to each condition. In this work, we extend theory on both fronts to encapsulate a potentially continuous spectrum of phenotypes arising in response to environmental fluctuations that drive changes in the phenotype-dependent growth rate. We consider two broad classes of stochastic environment: those that are temporally uncorrelated (modelled by white-noise processes), and those that are correlated (modelled by Poisson and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes). For tractability, we restrict analysis to an exponential growth model, and consider biologically relevant simplifications that pertain to the timescale of phenotype switching relative to fluctuations in the environment. These assumptions yield a series of analytical and semi-analytical expressions that reveal environments in which phenotypic heterogeneity is evolutionarily advantageous.</description>
