      <title>Properties of Quasi-synchronization Time of High-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of one-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause (HK) dynamics driven by noise has been extensively studied. Previous research has indicated that within no matter the bounded or the unbounded space of one dimension, the HK dynamics attain quasi-synchronization (synchronization in noisy case) in finite time. However, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon holds in high-dimensional space. This paper investigates the random time for quasi-synchronization of multi-dimensional HK model and reveals that the boundedness and dimensions of the space determine different outcomes. To be specific, if the space is bounded, quasi-synchronization can be attained almost surely for all dimensions within a finite time, whereas in unbounded space, quasi-synchronization can only be achieved in low-dimensional cases (one and two). Furthermore, different integrability of the random time of various cases is proved.</description>

      <title>A pseudospectral approach to rigorous numerical estimation of Ruelle resonances of transfer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances, isolated eigenvalues of a transfer operator acting on suitably chosen Banach spaces, play a fundamental role in understanding the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems. In this paper, we introduce a pseudospectral approach, inspired by Householder's theorem, for the rigorous, computer-assisted estimation of resonances, providing regions where resonances must exist and precluding the presence of resonances elsewhere. The approach is general, and applies to the transfer operators of a wide variety of chaotic systems, including Anosov/ Axiom A diffeomorphisms and piecewise expanding maps. We implement this approach computationally for a class of analytic uniformly expanding maps of the circle. We anticipate that the pseudospectral framework developed here will be broadly applicable to other spectral problems in dynamical systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Polynomial skew products with small relative degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local dynamics of a proper superattracting holomorphic germ $f$ in $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ possessing a totally invariant line $L$ such that $f^*L = d L$ with $d\ge 2$, and such that $f|_L$ has a superattracting fixed point at $0$ of order $2 \le c &lt; d$. We prove that any such map is formally conjugated to a skew product of the form $(z^d, P(z,w))$, where $P \in \mathbb{C}[[z]][w]$ is polynomial in $w$ of degree $c$, hence it induces a natural dynamics on the Berkovich affine line over $\mathbb{C}(\!(z)\!)$. Such non-Archimedean skew products were recently studied by Birkett and Nie-Zhao.
  On the non-Archimedean side, we focus on the restriction of the dynamics on the Berkovich open unit ball (which naturally contains all irreducible analytic germs at the origin). We exhibit an invariant compact set $\mathcal{K}$ outside of which all points tend to $L$, and which supports a natural ergodic invariant measure.
  By a careful analysis of local intersection numbers, we prove that the growth of multiplicity of iterated curves is controlled by the recurrence properties of the critical set. In particular, when no critical branch of $f$ belongs to $\mathcal{K}$, any point in $\mathcal{K}$ corresponds to a curve of uniformly bounded multiplicity at $0$.
  We then return to the complex picture and show the existence of an invariant pluripolar positive closed $(1,1)$-current $T$, outside of which all orbits converge to $0$ at super-exponential speed $c$. Under the same assumption on the critical branches as above, we prove that $T$ admits a geometric representation as an average of currents of integration over the curves in $\mathcal{K}$, with respect to the natural invariant measure. In particular, $T$ is uniformly laminar outside the origin.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal SEIQR Epidemic Modeling with Optimal Control for Vaccination, Treatment, and Social Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spatiotemporal SEIQR epidemic model governed by a system of reaction-diffusion partial differential equations that incorporates optimal control strategies. The model captures the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease across space and time. It includes three time-dependent control variables: preventive measures for susceptible individuals, quarantine for infectious individuals, and treatment for quarantined individuals. The study has four main objectives: (i) to prove the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of global strong solutions using analytic semigroup theory, (ii) to demonstrate the existence of optimal control strategies through functional analysis techniques, (iii) to derive first-order necessary optimality conditions via convex perturbation methods and adjoint equations, and (iv) to perform numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of different combinations of control interventions. The simulation results emphasize the advantages of combining pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to minimize disease prevalence and control-related expenses.</description>

      <title>Veech Surfaces and Expanding Twist Tori on Moduli Spaces of Abelian Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,\omega)$ be a translation surface such that every leaf of its horizontal foliation is either closed, or joins two zeros of $\omega$. Then, $M$ decomposes as a union of horizontal Euclidean cylinders. The $\textit{twist torus}$ of $(M,\omega)$, denoted $\mathbb{T}(\omega)$, consists of all translation surfaces obtained from $(M,\omega)$ by applying the horocycle flow independently to each of these cylinders. Let $g_t$ be the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow. We study the distribution of the expanding tori $g_t\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)$ on moduli spaces of translation surfaces in cases where $(M,\omega)$ is a $\textit{Veech surface}$. We provide sufficient criteria for these tori to become dense within the conjectured limiting locus $\mathcal{M} :=\overline{\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)}$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$. We also provide criteria guaranteeing a uniform lower bound on the mass a given open set $U\subset\mathcal{M}$ must receive with respect to any weak-$\ast$ limit of the uniform measures on $g_t\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$. In particular, all such limits must be fully supported in $\mathcal{M}$ in such cases. Finally, we exhibit infinite families of well-known examples of Veech surfaces satisfying each of these results. A key feature of our results in comparison to previous work is that they do not require passage to subsequences.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability Theory of a Neurologically-Inspired Parabolic PDE Model with a Nonlinear Time-Delayed Boundary Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of a positive, bounded solution for a class of parabolic partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, where the boundary conditions depend on the solution on the boundary at a time $\tau \geq 0$ in the past. These equations model the production dynamics of a protein species by a single cell, where a feedback mechanism downregulates the protein's production. Furthermore, we analyze the stability of a non-trivial steady-state solution and provide sufficient conditions on the nonlinearity parameter, boundary flux, and time delay that ensure the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>An Improved Autoencoder Conjugacy Network to Learn Chaotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for learning chaotic maps using an improved autoencoder neural network that incorporates a conjugacy layer in the latent space. The added conjugacy layer transforms nonlinear maps into a simple piecewise linear map (the tent map) whilst enforcing dynamical principles of well-known and defective conjugacy functions that increase the accuracy and stability of the learned solution. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on both continuous and piecewise chaotic one-dimensional maps and numerically illustrate improved performance over related traditional and recently emerged deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Periodic Solutions for Newtonian Systems via Lyapunov Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an existence theory for distributed periodic solutions to Newton's equation with stochastic time-periodic forcing, where the friction matrix is the Hessian of a twice continuously differentiable friction function. Employing the Khasminskii criterion and Lyapunov functions, we prove its existence under the assumptions that both the friction and potential functions tend to positive infinity at infinity, and their gradient inner product grows at least like an even-power polynomial. Provided the potential grows sufficiently fast at infinity, this result persists under bounded friction matrix perturbations. This largely confirms the stochastic Levinson conjecture proposed in [8] and resolves the open problem and the interesting problem posed in [8, P. 342].
  Distributed periodic solutions exist in two key cases:
  1. Polynomial Case: Both functions are polynomials with positive definite leading terms (a minimal condition for dissipation).
  2. Plasma Physics Case: The potential force is bounded, while the friction function has sufficiently high growth (as in many plasma physics models).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study positive energy solutions of the anisotropic Kepler problem with homogeneous potential. First some asymptotic property of positive energy solutions is obtained, as time goes to infinity. Afterwards, we prove the existence of hyperbolic solutions with given initial configuration and asymptotic behavior, when time goes to positive or negative infinity, and in the planar case, the existence of bi-hyperbolic solutions with given asymptotic behaviors, when time goes to both positive and negative infinities, under various conditions.</description>

      <title>A classification of global attractors for $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$, the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$ \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$, with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
  As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the polynomial entropy of the induced map $F_n(f)$ on the $n$-fold symmetric product of a compact space $X$ and its suspension are both equal to $nh_{pol}(f)$, when $f:X\to X$ is a homeomorphism with a finite non-wandering set $NW(f)$. We also give a lower bound for the polynomial entropy on the suspension, for a homeomorphism $f$ with at least one wandering point, under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Reversible switching due to attraction and repulsion: clusters, gaps, sorting, and mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a phase transition in continuum limits of interacting particle systems that exhibits a vertical bifurcation diagram. The transition is mediated by a competition short-range repulsion and long-range attraction. As a consequence of the transition, infinitesimal parameter variations allow switching between uniform distribution and clusters in single-species models, and between mixed and sorted states in multi-species contexts, without hysteresis. Our main technical contribution is a universal expansion for the size of vacuum bubbles that arise in this phase transition and a quantitative analysis of the effect of noise.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of 3D Filippov Systems around Cusp-Fold Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the local behavior of 3D Filippov systems $Z=(X,Y)$, focusing on the dynamics around cusp-fold singularities. These singular points, characterized by cubic contact of vector field $X$ and quadratic contact of vector field $Y$ on the switching manifold, are structurally unstable under small perturbations of $Z$, giving rise to significant bifurcation phenomena.
  We analyze the bifurcations of a 3D Filippov system around an invisible cusp-fold singularity, providing a detailed characterization of its crossing dynamics under certain conditions. We classify the characteristics of the singularity when it emerges generically in one-parameter families (a codimension-one phenomenon), and we show that no crossing limit cycles (CLCs) locally bifurcate from it in this particular scenario. When the vector fields $X$ and $Y$ are anti-collinear at the cusp-fold singularity, we provide conditions for the generic emergence of this point in two-parameter families (a codimension-two phenomenon). In this case, we show that the unfolding of such a singularity leads to a bifurcating CLC, which degenerates into a fold-regular polycycle (self-connection at a fold-regular singularity).
  Furthermore, we numerically derive the polycycle bifurcation curve and complete the two-parameter bifurcation set for a boost converter system previously studied in the literature. This allows the identification of parameter regions where the boost converter system exhibits a CLC in its phase portrait, providing a understanding of its complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring global landscape of free energy for the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing the complex landscape of infinite-dimensional free energy is generally a challenging problem. This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Annealed almost periodic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies certain notions of entropy that can be associated to (i) a representation of a separable, unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and (ii) an auxiliary random sequence $(\pi_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{A}$. This continues a previous research program into the properties of these entropy notions when each $\pi_n$ is deterministic, which uncovered a range of analogies with entropy in ergodic theory and also with non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorems.
  We associate two new notions of entropy to data as in (i) and (ii) above: `annealed' AP entropy, which is roughly a kind of first-moment average of deterministic AP entropies; and `zeroth-order' AP entropy, which controls the large deviations probabilities that certain positive definite functions appear in the representations $\pi_n$ at all.
  After developing some of this general theory, we then focus on the special case in which $\mathfrak{A}$ is the group C*-algebra of a finitely-generated free group and each $\pi_n$ is generated by choosing a tuple of $n$-by-$n$ unitary matrices independently at random from Haar measure. In that case, explicit formulas can be derived for some of our notions of entropy, and new large deviations principles in random matrix theory are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Zero-one Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.</description>

      <title>Equitability and explosive synchronisation in multiplex and higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster synchronisation is a key phenomenon observed in networks of coupled dynamical units. Its presence has been linked to symmetry and, more generally, to equability of the underlying network pattern of interactions between identical dynamical units. In this article, we clarify once and for all the relation between equitability and cluster synchronisation on a very general dynamical system which allows multi-layer and higher-order interactions. Namely, we show that equitability is a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the existence of independent cluster synchronised solutions. As an important consequence, our results explain the ubiquity of explosive synchronisation, as opposed to cluster synchronisation, in multi-layer and higher-order networks: equitability imposes additional constraints that must be simultaneously satisfied on the same set of nodes. Our results have important implications for the design of complex dynamical systems of coupled dynamical units with arbitrary cluster synchronisation patterns and coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Machine-Precision Prediction of Low-Dimensional Chaotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz-63 model are commonly used to benchmark system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data. Here we show that learning from noise-free observations in such systems can be achieved up to machine precision: using ordinary least squares regression on high-degree polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic, our method exceeds the accuracy of standard 64-bit numerical ODE solvers of the true underlying dynamical systems. Depending on the configuration, we obtain valid prediction times of 32 to 105 Lyapunov times for the Lorenz-63 system, dramatically outperforming prior work that reaches 13 Lyapunov times at most. We further validate our results on Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor, a non-polynomial chaotic system that is considerably more complex than the Lorenz-63 model, and show that similar results extend also to higher dimensions using the spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz-96 model. Our findings suggest that learning low-dimensional chaotic systems from noise-free data is a solved problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of large-time behaviour of trajectories for discrete-time dynamical systems driven by a random noise. Assuming that the phase space is finite-dimensional and compact, and the noise is a Markov process with a transition probability satisfying some regularity hypotheses, we prove that all the trajectories converge to a unique measure in the total variation metric. The proof is based on the Markovian reduction of the system in question and a result on mixing for Markov processes. Then we present an extension of this result to the case of systems driven by stationary noises.</description>

      <title>Discovering Governing Equations in the Presence of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of complex dynamical systems, understanding and accurately modeling the underlying physical processes is crucial for predicting system behavior and designing effective interventions. Yet real-world systems exhibit pronounced input (or system) variability and are observed through noisy, limited data conditions that confound traditional discovery methods that assume fixed-coefficient deterministic models. In this work, we theorize that accounting for system variability together with measurement noise is the key to consistently discover the governing equations underlying dynamical systems. As such, we introduce a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework that treats the unknown coefficients as random variables and infers their posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the push-forward of the posterior samples and the empirical data distribution. Benchmarks on four canonical problems -- the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system (multi- and single-trajectory), the historical Hudson Bay lynx-hare data, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and fluid infiltration in porous media using low- and high-viscosity liquids -- show that SIP consistently identifies the correct equations and lowers coefficient root-mean-square error by an average of 82\% relative to the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach and its Bayesian variant. The resulting posterior distributions yield 95\% credible intervals that closely track the observed trajectories, providing interpretable models with quantified uncertainty. SIP thus provides a robust, data-efficient approach for consistent physics discovery in noisy, variable, and data-limited settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate binary sequences generated by non-Markovian rules with memory length $\mu$, similar to those adopted in Elementary Cellular Automata. This generation procedure is equivalente to a shift register and certain rules produce sequences with maximal periods, known as de Bruijn sequences. We introduce a novel methodology for generating de Bruijn sequences that combines: (i) a set of derived properties that significantly reduce the space of feasible generating rules, and (ii) a neural network-based classifier that identifies which rules produce de Bruijn sequences. Experiments for large values of $\mu$ demonstrate the approach's effectiveness and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: First, we study the existence of solutions for a class of first order mean field games systems
\begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;H(x,u,Du)=F(x,m(t)),\quad &amp;&amp;x\in M,\ \forall\ t\in[0,T],\\ &amp;\partial_t m-\text{div}\left(m\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial p}(x,u,Du)\right)=0,\quad &amp;&amp;(x,t)\in M\times(0,T],\\ &amp;m(0)=m_0, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where the system comprises a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the contact case and an evolutionary continuity equation.
  Then, for any fixed $\lambda&gt;0$, let $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ be a solution of the system \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;H(x,\lambda u^\lambda,Du^\lambda)=F(x,m^\lambda(t))+c(m^\lambda(t)),\quad &amp;&amp;x\in M,\ \forall t\in[0,T],\\ &amp;\partial_t m^\lambda-\text{div}\left(m^\lambda\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial p}(x,\lambda u^\lambda,Du^\lambda)\right)=0,\quad &amp;&amp;(x,t)\in M\times(0,T],\\ &amp;m(0)=m_0, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where $c(m^\lambda(t))$ is the Ma\~n\'e critical value of the Hamiltonian $H(x,0,p)-F(x,m^\lambda(t))$. We investigate the selection problem for the limit of $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ as $\lambda$ tends to 0.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we construct examples of bounded smooth convex domains with no non-trivial analytic discs on the boundary which possess a holomorphic self-map without fixed points so that the iterates do not converge to a point (that is, the Denjoy-Wolff theorem does not hold). We also show that, in the case of bounded convex domains with $C^{1+\varepsilon}$-smooth boundary which have non-trivial analytic discs on the boundary, the cluster set of the orbits of holomorphic self-maps without fixed points can be equal to the principal part of any prime end of any planar bounded simply connected domain.</description>

      <title>The Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding and zeros of zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a discussion of the classical Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding and, in particular, its application to the study of zeta functions associated to geodesic flows and their zeros. In the case of compact surfaces of constant negative curvature $-1$ the analytic extension of the Selberg zeta function to the entire complex plane is classical, and can be achieved using the Selberg trace formula. However, an alternative dynamical approach is to use the Bowen$\unicode{x2013}$Series coding on the boundary at infinity to obtain a piecewise analytic expanding map from which the extension of the zeta function can be obtained using properties of the associated transfer operator. This latter method has the advantage that it also applies in the case of infinite area surfaces provided they do not have cusps. For such examples the location of the zeros is somewhat more mysterious. However, in particularly simple examples there is a striking structure to the zeros when we take appropriate limits. We will try to give some insight into this phenomenon.
  The newer version, in addition to the study of pair of pants, also includes heuristic analysis of the zeta function associated to the geodesic flow on symmetric one-funneled tori; in particular, there is a number of pure numerical results on location of its small zeros.</description>

      <title>Horn maps of holomorphic functions locally pseudo-conjugate on their parabolic basins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifted horn map of a holomorphic function with a simple parabolic point is well known to be a complete local conjugacy invariant; this is a classical result proved independently by \'Ecalle, Voronin, Martinet and Ramis. Lanford and Yampolski have shown that, if two functions $f_1, f_2$ with simple parabolic points at $z_1, z_2$ are globally conjugate on their immediate parabolic basins, with the conjugacy and its inverse continuous at $z_1$, resp. $z_2$, then their horn maps must be cover-equivalent: there are isomorphisms $\psi^+ : \mathcal{D}_1^+\to \mathcal{D}_2^+$ and $\psi^- : \mathcal{D}_1^-\to \mathcal{D}_2^-$ between the top and bottom connected components of their domains, and a translation $T$ on the cylinder, such that $\mathbb{h}_2\circ\psi^+ = T\circ \mathbb{h}_1$ and $\mathbb{h}_2\circ\psi^- = T\circ \mathbb{h}_1$ holds on these domains. In this article, we introduce a notion of (semi) local conjugacy on immediate parabolic basins, which we call local pseudo-conjugacy and which in particular does not make any continuity assumption, and show that the horn maps $\mathbb{h}_1$ and $\mathbb{h}_2$ satisfy the condition above if and only if the two functions $f_1, f_2$ are locally pseudo-conjugate. This result is a first step to better understand invariant classes by parabolic renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove ``effective'' linear response for certain classes of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems which are not necessarily composed in an i.i.d manner. In applications, the results are obtained for base maps with a sufficient amount of mixing. The fact that the rates are effective is then applied to obtain the differentiability of the variance in the CLT as a function of the parameter, as well as the annealed linear response. These two applications are beyond the reach of the linear response obtained in the general case, when all the random variables appearing in the bounds are only tempered. We also provide several wide examples of one-dimensional maps satisfying our conditions, as well as some higher-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows are all exponentially mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02537v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study strong spectral properties of Ruelle transfer operators related to Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. As a consequence we establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables with respect to any Gibbs measure. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat, and further developed in our papers in 2011 and 2023, is substantially enhanced here, allowing to deal with the general case of arbitrary contact Anosov flows and arbitrary Gibbs measures. The results obtained here naturally apply to geodesic flows on compact Riemannian manifolds.
  As is now well-known, the strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and a well-established technique by Dolgopyat lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\"older continuous potentials. Other immediate consequences are: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its interior; (b) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error.</description>

Abstract: For two-parameter families of dissipative twist maps, we investigate the dynamics of invariant graphs as well as the thresholds for their existence and breakdown. Our main results are as follows:
  (1) For arbitrarily small $C^r$ perturbations with $r \geq 1$, invariant graphs with prescribed rotation numbers can be realized by adjusting the parameters;
  (2) We characterize sharp perturbations that lead to the complete destruction of all invariant graphs;
  (3) When the perturbation fails to be $C^1$, Lipschitz invariant graphs with non-differentiable points may still persist, even though the Lipschitz norm meets the conditions required by the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem.</description>

      <title>The algebra of semi-flows: a tale of two topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To capture the global structure of a dynamical system we reformulate dynamics in terms of appropriately constructed topologies, which we call flow topologies; we call this process topologization. This yields a description of a semi-flow in terms of a bi-topological space, with the first topology corresponding to the (phase) space and the second to the flow topology. A study of topology is facilitated through discretization, i.e. defining and examining appropriate finite sub-structures. Topologizing the dynamics provides an elegant solution to their discretization by discretizing the associated flow topologies. We introduce Morse pre-orders, an instance of a more general bi-topological discretization, which synthesize the space and flow topologies, and encode the directionality of dynamics. We describe how Morse pre-orders can be augmented with appropriate (co)homological information in order to describe invariance of the dynamics; this ensemble provides an algebraization of the semi-flow. An illustration of the main ingredients of the paper is provided by an application to the theory of discrete parabolic flows. Algebraization yields a new invariant for positive braids in terms of a bi-graded differential module which contains Morse theoretic information of parabolic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the general two-dimensional Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature. These systems appear in application of the inverse scattering transform (IST) to an important class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) called integrable systems. Their solvability by quadrature is a key to obtain analytical expressions for solutions to the initial value problems of the integrable PDEs by using the IST. We prove that the ZS systems are always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potentials are reflectionless, under the condition that the potentials are absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$. Similar statements were previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials and the linear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation under meromorphic initial conditions by quadrature when the inverse scattering transform (IST) is applied. It is a key to solve the Schr\"odinger equation appearing in the Lax pair in application of the IST. We show that the Schr\"odinger equation is always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potential is reflectionless, under the condition that the potential is absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$.This statement was previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials. We also show that the Schr\"odinger equation is not integrable in this sense for rational potentials that decay at infinity but do not satisfy the weak condition.</description>

      <title>Moment formulas of Siegel transforms with congruence conditions in dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the first and second moment formulas for Siegel transforms related to problems counting primitive lattice points in the real plane with congruence conditions. As applications, we derive an analog of Schmidt's random counting theorem and the quantitative Khintchine theorem for irrational numbers, approximated by rational numbers $p/q$, where we place a congruence-conditional constraint on the vector $(p,q)$.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>
