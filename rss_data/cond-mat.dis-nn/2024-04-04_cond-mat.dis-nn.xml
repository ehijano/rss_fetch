      <title>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable interacting models. For intensive observables that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Structure-Informed Featurization and Property Prediction of Ordered, Dilute, and Random Atomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-informed materials informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline of materials science relying on the featurization of atomic structures or configurations to construct vector, voxel, graph, graphlet, and other representations useful for machine learning prediction of properties, fingerprinting, and generative design. This work discusses how current featurizers typically perform redundant calculations and how their efficiency could be improved by considering (1) fundamentals of crystallographic (orbits) equivalency to optimize ordered cases and (2) representation-dependent equivalency to optimize cases of dilute, doped, and defect structures with broken symmetry. It also discusses and contrasts ways of (3) approximating random solid solutions occupying arbitrary lattices under such representations.
  Efficiency improvements discussed in this work were implemented within pySIPFENN or python toolset for Structure-Informed Property and Feature Engineering with Neural Networks developed by authors since 2019 and shown to increase performance from 2 to 10 times for typical inputs. Throughout this work, the authors explicitly discuss how these advances can be applied to different kinds of similar tools in the community.</description>
