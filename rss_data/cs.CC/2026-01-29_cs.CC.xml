      <title>The Interplay Between Domination and Separation in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature, several identification problems in graphs have been studied, of which, the most widely studied are the ones based on dominating sets as a tool of identification. Hereby, the objective is to separate any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set. Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a code of the graph. In this paper, we study the four separation properties location, closed-separation, open-separation and full-separation. We address the complexity of finding minimum separating sets in a graph and study the interplay of these separation properties with several codes (establishing a particularly close relation between separation and codes based on domination) as well as the interplay of separation and complementation (showing that location and full-separation are the same on a graph and its complement, whereas closed-separation in a graph corresponds to open-separation in its complement).</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Decision Trees with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advances the theoretical understanding of active learning label complexity for decision trees as binary classifiers. We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\epsilon$ is close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Modular composition &amp; polynomial GCD in the border of small, shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular composition is the problem of computing the coefficient vector of the polynomial $f(g(x)) \bmod h(x)$, given as input the coefficient vectors of univariate polynomials $f$, $g$, and $h$ over an underlying field $\mathbb{F}$. While this problem is known to be solvable in nearly-linear time over finite fields due to work of Kedlaya &amp; Umans, no such near-linear-time algorithms are known over infinite fields, with the fastest known algorithm being from a recent work of Neiger, Salvy, Schost &amp; Villard that takes $O(n^{1.43})$ field operations on inputs of degree $n$. In this work, we show that for any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, modular composition is in the border of algebraic circuits with division gates of nearly-linear size and polylogarithmic depth. Moreover, this circuit family can itself be constructed in near-linear time.
  Our techniques also extend to other algebraic problems, most notably to the problem of computing greatest common divisors of univariate polynomials. We show that over any infinite field $\mathbb{F}$, the GCD of two univariate polynomials can be computed (piecewise) in the border sense by nearly-linear-size and polylogarithmic-depth algebraic circuits with division gates, where the circuits themselves can be constructed in near-linear time. While univariate polynomial GCD is known to be computable in near-linear time by the Knuth--Sch\"{o}nhage algorithm, or by constant-depth algebraic circuits from a recent result of Andrews &amp; Wigderson, obtaining a parallel algorithm that simultaneously achieves polylogarithmic depth and near-linear work remains an open problem of great interest. Our result shows such an upper bound in the setting of border complexity.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Spanning Tree Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08314v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Spanning Tree Congestion problem, where we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and are asked to find a spanning tree $T$ of minimum maximum congestion. Here, the congestion of an edge $e\in T$ is the number of edges $uv\in E$ such that the (unique) path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ traverses $e$. We consider this well-studied NP-hard problem from the point of view of (structural) parameterized complexity and obtain the following results.
  We resolve a natural open problem by showing that Spanning Tree Congestion is not FPT parameterized by treewidth (under standard assumptions). More strongly, we present a generic reduction which applies to (almost) any parameter of the form ``vertex-deletion distance to class $\mathcal{C}$'', thus obtaining W[1]-hardness for parameters more restricted than treewidth, including tree-depth plus feedback vertex set, or incomparable to treewidth, such as twin cover. Via a slight tweak of the same reduction we also show that the problem is NP-complete on graphs of modular-width $4$.
  Even though it is known that Spanning Tree Congestion remains NP-hard on instances with only one vertex of unbounded degree, it is currently open whether the problem remains hard on bounded-degree graphs. We resolve this question by showing NP-hardness on graphs of maximum degree 8.
  Complementing the problem's W[1]-hardness for treewidth...</description>
