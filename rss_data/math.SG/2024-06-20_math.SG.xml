      <title>A Mathematical Definition of Path Integrals on Symplectic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a mathematical definition of some path integrals, emphasizing those relevant to the quantization of symplectic manifolds (and more generally, Poisson manifolds) $\unicode{x2013}$ in particular, the coherent state path integral. We show that K\"{a}hler manifolds provide many computable examples.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Stiefel manifold: tractable metrics, second-order geometry and Newton's methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization under the symplecticity constraint is an approach for solving various problems in quantum physics and scientific computing. Building on the results that this optimization problem can be transformed into an unconstrained problem on the symplectic Stiefel manifold, we construct geometric ingredients for Riemannian optimization with a new family of Riemannian metrics called tractable metrics and develop Riemannian Newton schemes. The newly obtained ingredients do not only generalize several existing results but also provide us with freedom to choose a suitable metric for each problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first try to develop the explicit second-order geometry and Newton's methods on the symplectic Stiefel manifold. For the Riemannian Newton method, we first consider novel operator-valued formulas for computing the Riemannian Hessian of a~cost function, which further allows the manifold to be endowed with a weighted Euclidean metric that can provide a preconditioning effect. We then solve the resulting Newton equation, as the central step of Newton's methods, directly via transforming it into a~saddle point problem followed by vectorization, or iteratively via applying any matrix-free iterative method either to the operator Newton equation or its saddle point formulation. Finally, we propose a hybrid Riemannian Newton optimization algorithm that enjoys both global convergence and quadratic/superlinear local convergence at the final stage. Various numerical experiments are presented to validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Heegaard-Floer TQFT for link cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Heegaard-Floer homology functor from the category of oriented links in closed $3$-manifolds and oriented surface cobordisms in $4$-manifolds connecting them to the category of $\mathbb{F}[v]$-modules and $\mathbb{F}[v]$-homomorphisms between them, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the field with two elements. In comparison with previously defined TQFTs for decorated links and link cobordisms, the construction of this paper has the advantage of being independent from the decoration. Some of the basic properties of this functor are also explored.</description>

      <title>Floer-type bipersistence modules and rectangle barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the pointwise finite-dimensional two-parameter persistence module $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$, defined in terms of interlevel filtered Floer homology, is rectangle-decomposable. This allows for the definition of a barcode $\mathcal{B}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$ consisting only of rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ associated with $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$. We observe that this rectangle barcode contains information about Usher's boundary depth and spectral invariants developed by Oh, Schwarz, and Viterbo. Moreover, we establish relevant stability results, particularly concerning the bottleneck distance and Hofer's distance.</description>

      <title>Fibrations by Lagrangian tori for maximal Calabi-Yau degenerations and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general technique to construct Lagrangian torus fibrations in degenerations of K\"ahler manifolds. We show that such torus fibrations naturally occur at the boundary of the A'Campo space. This space extends a degeneration over a punctured disc to a hybrid space involving its real oriented blowup and the dual complex of the special fiber; equipped with an exact modification of a given K\"ahler form which becomes fiberwise symplectic at the boundary. Therefore, it allows to move Lagrangian tori from the "radius zero" fibers at the boundary to the nearby fibers of the original generation using the symplectic connection. As a consequence, for any maximal Calabi-Yau degeneration we prove that a generic region of each nearby fiber admits a Lagrangian torus fibration with asymptotic properties expected from the (conjectural) Strominger--Yau--Zaslow fibration.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone and Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a smooth manifold, we associate to any closed differential form a mapping cone complex. The cohomology of this mapping cone complex can vary with the de Rham cohomology class of the closed form. We present a novel Morse theoretical description for the mapping cone cohomology. Specifically, we introduce a Morse complex for the mapping cone complex which is generated by pairs of critical points with the differential defined by gradient flows and an integration of the closed form over spaces of gradient flow lines. We prove that the cohomology of our cone Morse complex is isomorphic to the mapping cone cohomology and hence independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex. We also obtain sharp inequalities that bound the dimension of the mapping cone cohomology in terms of the number of Morse critical points and the properties of the specified closed form. Our results are widely applicable, especially for any manifold equipped with a geometric structure described by a closed differential form. We also obtain a bound on the difference between the number of Morse critical points and the Betti numbers.</description>
