      <title>3D Conformal Field Theory in Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study three dimensional Lorentzian conformal field theories in twistor space. We formulate the conformal Ward identities and solve for two and three point Lorentzian Wightman functions. We found that the Helicity operators apart from the conformal generators play an important role in fixing their functional form. The equations take the form of first order Euler equations which in addition to the usual solutions that are polynomials, also possess weak solutions which are distributional in nature. All of these play an important role in our analysis. For instance, in the case of three point functions, the distributional solutions are indeed the ones realized by the CFT correlators. We also extend our analysis to parity odd Wightman functions which take an interesting form in twistor space. We verify our results by systematically analyzing the corresponding Wightman functions in momentum space and spinor helicity variables and matching with the twistor results via a half-Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Gauging the complex SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Ground States of the $(2,0)$-theory on Dicyclic Orbifolds of $S^3\times S^2$ with External String Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Witten index of the Hilbert space of the $(2,0)$-theory compactified on spaces of the form $S^3/\Gamma\times S^2$, with a freely acting group $\Gamma$, and with external string sources implemented via timelike surface operator insertions, is expressed in terms of Ray-Singer torsion of $S^3/\Gamma$ and characters of irreducible representations of $\Gamma$. We compute it explicitly for the Dicyclic groups $\Gamma=\text{Dic}_k$. The torsion and characters are generally irrational numbers, but they nicely combine to an integer index. The results suggest fusion relations among the string sources with integer coefficients expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <title>Calogero-Sutherland-type quantum systems, generalized hypergeometric functions and superintegrability for integral chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the Calogero-Sutherland-type (CS-type) models and generalized hypergeometric functions. We construct the generalized CS operators for circular, Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel cases and establish the generalized Lasselle-Nekrasov correspondence. To analyze the properties of CS operators and the generalized hypergeometric functions, the $\hat W$-operators and $\hat O$-operator are constructed based on the $\mathbf{SH}_N$ algebra. For the generalized hypergeometric functions, we present their $O$-representations in terms of $\hat O$-operator and give a family of constraints, where the constraint operators are given by the $\hat W$-operators. We analyze the superintegrability for the $\beta$-deformed integrals, where the measures are associated with the corresponding ground state wave functions of Hermite, Laguerre, Jacobi and Bessel type CS models. Then based on the generalized Laplace transformation of Jack polynomials, we construct two integral chains. One of which is a superintegrable model and equal to the generalized hypergeometric function. Another one is the skew version of the previous integral chain.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

      <title>Proper Effective Temperature and Order Parameters in Relativistic Non-Equilibrium Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative holography and temperature dependence of QGP viscosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Bayesian analyses of heavy ion collision data have established a non-trivial temperature dependence of the shear and bulk viscosity per entropy. Motivated by this, we consider higher derivative corrections to realistic, bottom-up holographic models of quark-gluon plasma based on five-dimensional Einstein-dilaton theories and determine the dilaton potentials in the higher derivative terms by matching the Bayesian analyses. A byproduct of our analysis is the bulk viscosity that follows from the holographic V-QCD theory. Higher derivative corrections when treated perturbatively lead to tension with existing data. We investigate possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and restoration by helical magnetic fields in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of helical magnetic fields on chiral symmetry breaking within the AdS/QCD framework using the D3/D7-brane model. By analyzing the brane embeddings, we obtain three types of massless solutions, corresponding to three phases with different behavior in the dual field theory. From the study of quark condensates, free energy, and electric currents, we find that helical magnetic fields can counteract uniform-field-induced symmetry breaking, driving the system towards symmetry restoration. We also find an effect analog to the chiral magnetic effect whereby the current is parallel to the magnetic field. We further study the massive case, and find that the helical configuration is less effective in erasing the first order phase transition that is present in the case of a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Light dilaton near critical points in top-down holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of UV-complete, strongly coupled, confining three-dimensional field theories, that exhibit a novel stabilisation mechanism for the mass of the lightest scalar composite state, relying on the existence of a critical point. The theories admit a holographic dual description in terms of regular backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Their phase diagram includes a line of first-order phase transitions ending at the critical point, where the transition becomes of second order. We calculate the mass spectrum of bound states of the field theory, by considering fluctuations around the background solutions, and find that, near the critical point, a hierarchy of scales develops, such that one state becomes parametrically light. We identify this state as the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This stabilisation mechanism might be exploited to address hierarchy problems in particle and astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions of three dimensional E$_{6}$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to construct exceptional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes carrying E$_{6}$ charges as solutions to the 3D higher spin Anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity with E$_{6}$ boundary conditions. Guided by Tits-Satake graphs of real forms of the e$_{6} $ Lie algebra, we build three remarkable E$_{6}$-higher spin black hole models: the linear-exceptional and the ortho-exceptional BTZ solutions result from splitting the extremal nodes in the E$_{6\left( 6\right)}$ Tits-Satake diagram while the pure exceptional-exceptional model follows from the folding down to F$_{4\left( 4\right) }$. And with the help of Hasse diagram visualizations, we study the ensuing higher spin spectrums to develop the corresponding metrics using two types of gauge transformations. For completeness, we examine the thermodynamics of the standard BTZ coupled to E$_{6}$ higher spin gravity fields by computing the partition function exploiting a one to one correspondence between the factors of the vacuum characters and the roots of the E$_{6}$ root system.</description>

      <title>A Tropical Look at Coisotropic Branes and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of tropical branes by exploring the tropicalization of topological sigma models with boundaries. We show that the tropical limit naturally decomposes conventional A-branes into two distinct classes: tropical Lagrangian branes and tropical coisotropic branes. By carefully analyzing the modified boundary conditions emerging from the tropological sigma models, we construct these tropical branes explicitly and demonstrate their utility in an example where we quantize a symplectic manifold through the use of a tropical version of brane quantization.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Structure of Loop Amplitudes and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-similar structure of loop amplitudes in quantum field theory and apply it to amplitude generation and renormalization. A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is best described as a coupling in the effective action. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a constant coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This approach also provides an alternative bottom-up method to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Bosonisation and BTZ Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the boundary dynamics of \(AdS_3\) gravity is governed by the collective field theory Hamiltonian proposed by Jevicki and Sakita, its asymptotic symmetry algebra becomes the centerless \(U(1)\) Kac-Moody algebra. We quantize this system using the quantum bosonization of relativistic free fermions and relate these to the dynamical fields of \(AdS_3\) gravity. This leads to a correspondence where different bulk configurations correspond to distinct states (particle-hole pair excitations) in the fermionic Hilbert space. This mapping allows us to construct BTZ black hole microstates, represented by Young diagrams of irreducible \(U(\infty)\) representations. Notably, the logarithm of the microstate degeneracy exactly reproduces the classical entropy of the BTZ black hole.</description>

      <title>The chiral SYK model in three-dimensional holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate duality between the $(0+1)$-dimensional quantum mechanical SYK model and two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, mediated by the Schwarzian action as an effective low energy theory common to both systems. We here propose a generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. Starting from different microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional generalizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action which has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional gravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of three-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and boundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply semiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the computation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating maximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Boundary Modes in String Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the construction of boundary contributions to free string field theory actions in the context of the bosonic string. We show that it is generally possible to obtain a well-defined variational principle by adding a simple boundary term (which only depends on the value of the bulk fields at the boundary) to the original bulk action. However, it is in general not possible to do this in a gauge-invariant way unless suitable boundary degrees of freedom are added. We explicitly construct such boundary contributions for the massless level of both the open and the closed SFT, as well as for the tensionless limit of the full string field theory. Our results reproduce linearized general relativity with the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and provide similar gauge-invariant actions for the infinite tower of massless higher-spin gauge theories for all Regge trajectories. By writing down a gauge-invariant action for the first massive level of the open string, we provide evidence that an analogous construction should be possible for the full tensile string field theory.</description>

      <title>Rotating black holes experience dynamical tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the dynamical tidal response of a Kerr black hole (BH) and demonstrate its tidal Love numbers to be non-vanishing when present in a non-axisymmetric external tidal field. To leading order, they depend quadratically on the black hole spin and linearly on the mode frequency. This implies that Kerr BHs are deformable under certain external, time-dependent perturbations. Since non-vanishing tidal Love numbers have been used in compact binary coalescences observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration to infer their non-BH nature, our findings have important implications on such inferences from future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence Between the Schrodinger Equation in Quantum Mechanics and the Euler-Bernoulli Equation in Elasticity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is mathematically equivalent to the Euler-Bernoulli equation for vibrating beams and plates in elasticity theory, with dependent initial data. Remarks are made on potential applications of this equivalence for symplectic and quantum computing, the two-slit experiment using vibrating beams and plates, and the p-adic Euler-Bernoulli equation.</description>

      <title>Gauge Covariant Link Formulation of Twisted N=D=4 and N=4 D=5 Super Yang-Mills on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of four dimensional super Yang-Mills model with a twisted N=4 supersymmetry in a manifestly gauge covariant manner. The formulation we employ here is a four dimensional extension of the manifestly gauge covariant method which was developed in our proposals of Dirac-Kahler twisted N=D=2 and N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills on a lattice. Twisted N=4 supersymmetry algebra is geometrically realized on a four dimensional lattice with link supercharges and the use of link (anti-)commutators. Employing Grassmann parameters with link nature, we explicitly show that the resulting super Yang-Mills action is invariant under all the supercharges on a lattice without chiral fermion problems. As a group and algebraic interpretation of the link approach, we show that promoting bosonic supercovariant derivatives to their exponentials consistently with the lattice Leibniz rule naturally gives rise to the notion of gauge covariant link (anti-)commutators. This can be regarded as a fermionic decomposition of a Lie group element, which may provide a new methodology in super Lie group and super Lie algebra. We also provide a five dimensional lift-up of the formulation with exact N=4 SUSY invariance on a five dimensional lattice.</description>

      <title>Towards a Manifestly Causal Approach to Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new, probability-level approach to calculations in scalar field particle scattering. The approach involves the implicit summation over final states, which makes causality manifest since retarded propagators emerge naturally. Novel diagrams represent algebraic terms at the probability level, akin to Feynman diagrams at the amplitude level. We present a list of rules which generate all probability-level diagrams for particle scattering processes in which one is fully inclusive over final states that contain no initial-state particles. The inclusivity and causal structure of this formalism may offer insights into the cancellation of infrared divergences if applied to gauge theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental physics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a potential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of gravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from classical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost due to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We investigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced density matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a scalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum decoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating temperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which decoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing the quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low energy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete decoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for higher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in the range $100\ {\rm Hz} \text{-} 10^8\ {\rm Hz}$, which depends on the reheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on reheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above $10^7\ {\rm Hz}$.</description>

      <title>Colored Jones Polynomials and the Volume Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the vertex model approach for braid representations, we compute polynomials for spin-1 placed on hyperbolic knots up to 15 crossings. These polynomials are referred to as 3-colored Jones polynomials or adjoint Jones polynomials. Training a subset of the data using a fully connected feedforward neural network, we predict the volume of the knot complement of hyperbolic knots from the adjoint Jones polynomial or its evaluations with 99.34% accuracy. A function of the adjoint Jones polynomial evaluated at the phase $q=e^{ 8 \pi i / 15 }$ predicts the volume with nearly the same accuracy as the neural network. From an analysis of 2-colored and 3-colored Jones polynomials, we conjecture the best phase for $n$-colored Jones polynomials, and use this hypothesis to motivate an improved statement of the volume conjecture. This is tested for knots for which closed form expressions for the $n$-colored Jones polynomial are known, and we show improved convergence to the volume.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Consequences of Varying Couplings in Gravity Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lagrangian formulation for gravity with matter where the gravitational couplings are universally treated as being field-dependent. The solutions for FLRW geometries and the associated time evolution of the Newton and cosmological couplings are found. The distance-redshift relations are shown to prefer a slowly growing Newton's coupling along with a negative equation of state ($w\geq -\frac{1}{3}$) for the matter fluid at the present epoch of accelerated expansion, while ruling out Dirac's large number hypothesis. We obtain an improved bound on $\dot{G}(t)$ as: $1.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{G}}{G}&lt;3.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$ in the context of supernova cosmology, as well as a new constraint on $\dot{\Lambda}(t)$ as: $-0.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}&lt;\frac{\dot{\Lambda}}{\Lambda}&lt;-1.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$. Based on this formulation, we also present a dynamical solution to the `cosmic coincidence' problem.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>

      <title>A Louder Gravitational Wave Bang from a Fast-Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector may produce all or part of the low-frequency gravitational wave signal recently reported by the NANOGrav Collaboration and other pulsar timing arrays. Here we point out, with a simple toy model, that even if the amplitude of the gravitational wave background from the dark phase transition is insufficient to match the NANOGrav signal, a modified expansion rate at early times may considerably enhance the gravitational wave signal. In particular, a faster-than-standard expansion rate, triggered, for instance, by the presence of one or more additional sources of energy density redshifting with higher powers of temperatures than radiation, boosts upper limits on the gravitational wave signal from first-order cosmological phase transitions, enlarging the slate of possible dark sector scenarios matching the NANOGrav signal.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles can couple to Standard Model gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, and massive fermions. A future multi-TeV muon collider provides a favorable environment to probe axion-like particles through multiple production channels, including vector boson fusion via electroweak gauge boson couplings and the top-associated production mediated by direct fermionic couplings. Motivated by the quality issue of the QCD axion, we focus on axion-like particles with masses and decay constants around the TeV scale. We explore how different axion-like particle couplings shape its production and decay modes, revealing a rich and intricate phenomenological landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is very well-known, linearisation of the instanton equations on a 4-manifold gives rise to an elliptic complex of differential operators, the truncated (twisted) Hodge complex $\Lambda^0(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Lambda^1(\mathfrak{g})\to \Lambda^2_+(\mathfrak{g})$. Moreover, the linearisation of the full YM equations also fits into this framework, as it is given by the second map followed by its adjoint. We define and study properties of what we call the Pleba\'nski complex. This is a differential complex that arises by linearisation of the equations implying that a Riemannian 4-manifold is hyper-K\"ahler. We recall that these are most naturally stated as the condition that there exists a perfect $\Sigma^i\wedge \Sigma^j\sim\delta^{ij}$ triple $\Sigma^i, i=1,2,3$ of 2-forms that are closed $d\Sigma^i=0$. The Riemannian metric is encoded by the 2-forms $\Sigma^i$. We show that what results is an elliptic differential complex $TM \to S\to E\times \Lambda^1 \to E$, where $S$ is the tangent space to the space of perfect triples, and $E=\mathbb{R}^3$. We also show that, as in the case with instanton equations, the full Einstein equations $Ric=0$ also fit into this framework, their linearisation being given by the second map followed by its adjoint. Our second result concerns the elliptic operator that the Pleba\'nski complex defines. In the case of the instanton complex, operators appearing in the complex supplemented with their adjoints assemble to give the Dirac operator. We show how the same holds true for the Pleba\'nski complex. Supplemented by suitable adjoints, operators assemble into an elliptic operator that squares to the Laplacian and is given by the direct sum of two Dirac operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigidly rotating body in unbounded space is usually considered a pathological system since it leads to faster-than-light velocities and associated breaches of causality. However, numerical results on chiral symmetry breaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close correspondence in predictions between rigorous bounded and formal unbounded approaches. Within the mean-field approach, we adopt three consecutive levels of approximation to the ground state of the system that feature a uniform (model 1), weakly-inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneus (model 3) condensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of the condensate, show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. Model 3 exhibits a deviation from the Tolman-Ehrenfest prediction due to the appearance of a new energy scale set by the inhomogeneity of the ground state. Its boundary conditions are fixed by imposing regularity at the rotation axis and by demanding the global minimization of the grand potential. We dub the latter as ``firewall boundary conditions,'' translating into the requirement of vanishing condensate on the light cylinder, which follows from the fact that the system state formally diverges at the light cylinder. In all models, we present the phase diagram of the system and point out that in models 2 and 3, the system resides either in a chirally-restored phase, or in a mixed phase that possesses spatially-separated chirally-restored and chirally-broken phases.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <title>The Roberge-Weiss transition for QCD in a magnetic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a magnetic background field influences the location and the nature of the Roberge-Weiss (RW) finite temperature transition for $N_f = 2+1$ QCD with physical quark masses. To that purpose, we perform numerical simulations of the finite temperature theory, discretized through stout staggered quarks and the tree-level improved Symanzik pure gauge action, considering two different values of the Euclidean temporal extent in lattice units, $N_t = 6, 8$. The RW transition temperature $T_{RW}$ decreases with $eB$, in particular it follows closely the behavior of the pseudo-critical QCD crossover temperature $T_{pc}$, so that $T_{RW} (eB) - T_{pc}(eB)$ is practically constant, within errors, for magnetic fields up to $eB \sim 1$ GeV$^2$; consistent results are found from the drop of the chiral condensate, which signals chiral symmetry restoration, leading also to the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis above the transition. Moreover, we find that the magnetic field turns the RW transition from second order to first order, with a tri-critical magnetic field in-between 1 and 2.4 GeV$^2$, i.e. for magnetic fields substantially lower than those for which the standard QCD transition turns to first order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales that is operative after recombination. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field, $\phi$, that is coupled to the electromagnetic field tensor via a $\phi F \wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian of axion-electrodynamics. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$.</description>

      <title>Wormhole geometries in $f\left(R,T^2\right)$ gravity satisfying the energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of traversable wormhole spacetimes within the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity, also known as $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $T_{ab}$ is the energy-momentum tensor, and $T^2 = T_{ab}T^{ab}$. Adopting a linear functional form $f(R,T^2) = R + \gamma T^2$, we demonstrate the existence of a wide range of wormhole solutions that satisfy all of the energy conditions without requiring fine-tuning of the model parameters. Due to the inherent complexity of the field equations, these solutions are constructed through an analytical recursive method. However, they lack a natural localization, requiring a junction with an external vacuum region. To address this, we derive the corresponding junction conditions and establish that the matching must always be smooth, precluding the formation of thin shells at the interface. Using these conditions, we match the interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild solution, yielding localized, static, and spherically symmetric wormholes that satisfy all the energy conditions throughout the entire spacetime. Finally, we extend our analysis to more intricate dependencies on $T^2$, demonstrating that the methodology remains applicable as long as no mixed terms between $R$ and $T^2$ are introduced.</description>

      <title>Topological Susceptibility in the Superconductive Phases of Quantum Chromodynamics: a Dyson-Schwinger Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test non-perturbative gluon propagators recently studied in the literature, by computing the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, of the superconductive phases of Quantum Chromodynamics at high density. We formulate the problem within the High-Density Effective Theory, and use the 2-particle irreducible formalism to compute the effective potential of the dense phases. We focus on superconductive phases with two and three massless flavors. Within this formalism, we write a Dyson-Schwinger equation in the rainbow approximation for the anomalous part of the quark propagator in the superconductive phases, in which the non-perturbative gluon propagator plays its role. We complete the model by adding a $U(1)_A$-breaking term whose coupling is fixed perturbatively at large quark chemical potential. We then use the effective potential to compute $\chi$ in the superconductive phases. We finally discuss implications of the results for the axion mass in superdense phases of Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way, scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic-string spacetime and in a non-inertial framework, with a generalized gravitational interaction containing both relativistic and quantum corrections. Solutions for the quantum-corrected gravitational interaction for an arbitrary state are reported in a quasi-exact manner and a discussion of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in double confluent Heun form, is given.</description>

      <title>Particle production induced by a Lorentzian non-commutative spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine particle production, evaporation, and greybody factors for a Lorentzian non-commutative black hole. We begin by analyzing particle creation for bosons, considering scalar perturbations to compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, which enable the determination of the Hawking temperature $T_{\Theta}$. Subsequently, we describe Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand metric representation, allowing the evaluation of divergent integrals via the residue method. This approach yields the particle creation density for bosonic modes. Next, we extend the analysis to fermions, obtaining the corresponding particle creation density. The black hole evaporation is then examined through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, leading to an estimate of the black hole's lifetime. In this context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole reaches the final stage of its evaporation. Furthermore, we compute greybody factors for bosons, taking into account scalar, vector, and tensorial perturbations. Finally, we determine the greybody factors for fermions as well. Overall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\Theta = 0$), the presence of the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces the particle creation density for both bosons and fermions, causing the evaporation process to proceed more slowly. Additionally, $\Theta$ decreases the magnitude of the greybody factors for bosons and fermions across all perturbations considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Global Anomalies on the Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain global anomalies can be detected in an elementary fashion by analyzing the way the symmetry algebra is realized on the torus Hilbert space of the anomalous theory. Distinct anomalous behaviours imprinted in the Hilbert space are identified with the distinct cohomology "layers" that appear in the classification of anomalies in terms of cobordism groups. We illustrate the manifestation of the layers in the Hilbert for a variety of anomalous symmetries and spacetime dimensions, including time-reversal symmetry, and both in systems of fermions and in anomalous topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 2+1d. We argue that anomalies can imply an exact bose-fermi degeneracy in the Hilbert space, thus revealing a supersymmetric spectrum of states; we provide a sharp characterization of when this phenomenon occurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in strongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop the construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular data in spin TQFTs, material that can be read on its own.</description>

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Emergent AdS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

Abstract: For the spinning superparticle we construct the pull-back of the world-line path integral to super moduli space in the Hamiltonian formulation. We describe the underlying geometric decomposition of super moduli space. Algebraically, this gives a realization of the cyclic complex. The resulting space-time action is classically equivalent to Yang-Mills theory up to boundary terms and additional non-local interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermal two-point functions and four-point functions involving two heavy twisted operators and two light probes in symmetric product orbifolds. We identify cases where they are universal at large $N$, that is, they are only sensitive to the orbifold structure. Surprisingly, such observables mimic correlators obtained from the BTZ background, even though symmetric product orbifolds are not dual to semi-classical gravity. We discuss the interpretation of these results in light of the criteria for emergence of spacetime via Von Neumann algebras. Our analysis implies that a condition on the infinite $N$ thermal two-point functions cannot be stringent enough to define an emergent spacetime and the concept of a sharp horizon.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh nonperturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the critical behavior of multi-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a matrix model, by combining the Schwinger-Dyson equations with positivity constraints on its solutions, in the large $N$ limit one is able to obtain explicit and numerical bounds on its moments. This technique is known as bootstrapping with positivity. In this paper we use this technique to estimate the critical points and exponents of several multi-matrix models. As a proof of concept, we first show it can be used to find the well-studied quartic single matrix model's critical phenomena. We then apply the method to several similar ``unsolved" 2-matrix models with various quartic interactions. We conjecture and present strong evidence for the string susceptibility exponent for some of these models to be $\gamma = 1/2$, which heuristically indicates that the continuum limit will likely be the Continuum Random Tree. For the other 2-matrix models, we find estimates of new string susceptibility exponents that may indicate a new continuum limit. We then study an unsolved 3-matrix model that generalizes the 3-colour model with cubic interactions. Additionally, for all of these models, we are able to derive explicitly the first several terms of the free energy in the large $N$ limit as a power series expansion in the coupling constants at zero by exploiting the structure of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We reveal a novel aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\,$The dynamics of the dilaton can induce variations in the Planck constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. $\,$Our mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes via the dilaton offers a viable alternative account for late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE. The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quark-gluon vertex.</description>

      <title>Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration, homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched off. The velocity vector (components and magnitude) undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity kick'. The cause behind this permanent change appears to be linked to the difference between the vector potentials before and after the duration of the electric pulse. Further, we show how such vector potentials in the past and future are related through a gauge transformation. In summary, our results suggest a pulse-induced `electromagnetic memory-like effect', which is not quite a `wave memory', but, nevertheless, has similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on two key observables: the angular separation between the first and subsequent images, and the ratio of the flux intensity of the first image to the cumulative flux intensity of all other images. By deriving analytical expressions for these observables, we explore the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>
