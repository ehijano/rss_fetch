      <title>Equichordal Points of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equichordal point problem is a classical question in geometry, asking whether there exist multiple equichordal points within a single convex body. An equichordal point is defined as a point through which all chords of the convex body have the same length. This problem, initially posed by Fujiwara and further investigated by Blaschke, Rothe, and Weitzenb\"ock, has remained an intriguing challenge, particularly in higher dimensions. In this paper, we rigorously prove the nonexistence of multiple equichordal points in $n$-dimensional convex bodies for $n \geq 2$. By utilizing topological tools such as the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and analyzing the properties of continuous functions and mappings on convex bodies, we resolve this long-standing question.</description>

      <title>Expensive Homeomorphism of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the longstanding question of whether expansive homeomorphisms can exist within convex bodies in Euclidean spaces. Utilizing fundamental tools from topology, including the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, we establish the nonexistence of such mappings. Through an inductive approach based on dimension and the extension of boundary homeomorphisms, we demonstrate that expansive homeomorphisms are incompatible with the compact and convex structure of these bodies. This work highlights the interplay between topological principles and metric geometry, offering new insights into the constraints imposed by convexity.</description>

      <title>Alberti representations, rectifiability of metric spaces and higher integrability of measures satisfying a PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for a Borel subset $E\subset X$ of a complete metric space with $\mathcal{H}^n(E)&lt;\infty$ to be $n$-rectifiable. This condition involves a decomposition of $E$ into rectifiable curves known as an Alberti representation. Precisely, we show that if $\mathcal{H}^n|_E$ has $n$ independent Alberti representations, then $E$ is $n$-rectifiable. This is a sharp strengthening of prior results of Bate and Li. It has been known for some time that such a result answers many open questions concerning rectifiability in metric spaces, which we discuss.
  An important step of our proof is to establish the higher integrability of measures on Euclidean space satisfying a PDE constraint. These results provide a quantitative generalisation of recent work of De Philippis and Rindler and are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to give a short proof of a result of Py\"or\"al\"a--Shmerkin--Suomala--Wu; the Sierpi\'nski carpet, and generalisations, are tube-null; they can be covered with tubes of arbitrarily small total width. We remark that a more general class of sponge-like sets satisfy this property. For a given $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the proof is able to give an explicit description of the tubes for which the total width is less than $\epsilon.$</description>

      <title>Partitions of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into unit circles with no well-ordering of the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a well-ordering on the reals, one can prove there exists a partition of the three-dimensional Euclidean space into unit circles (PUC). We show that the converse does not hold: there exist models of $\mathsf{ZF}$ without a well-ordering of the reals in which such partition exists. Specifically, we prove that the Cohen model has a PUC and construct a model satisfying $\mathsf{DC}$ where this is also the case. Furthermore, we present a general framework for constructing similar models for other paradoxical sets, under some conditions of extendability and amalgamation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1707.06848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a constructive, variational proof of Rivin's realization theorem for ideal hyperbolic polyhedra with prescribed intrinsic metric, which is equivalent to a discrete uniformization theorem for spheres. The same variational method is also used to prove a discrete uniformization theorem of Gu et al. and a corresponding polyhedral realization result of Fillastre. The variational principles involve twice continuously differentiable functions on the decorated Teichm\"uller spaces $\widetilde{\mathcal{T}_{g,n}}$ of punctured surfaces, which are analytic in each Penner cell, convex on each fiber over $\mathcal{T}_{g,n}$, and invariant under the action of the mapping class group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metrics in Grassmannians, or distances between subspaces of same dimension, have many uses, and extending them to the Total Grassmannian of subspaces of different dimensions is an important problem, as usual extensions lack good properties or give little information. Dimensional asymmetries call for the use of asymmetric metrics, and we present a natural method to obtain them, extending all the main Grassmannian metrics (geodesic, projection Frobenius, Fubini-Study, gap, etc.). Their geometry adequately reflects containment relations of subspaces, continuous paths link subspaces of distinct dimensions, and we describe minimal geodesics, shortest paths to move a subspace onto another. In particular, the Fubini-Study metric extends as an asymmetric angle that is easily computed, has many useful properties, and a nice geometric interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two points $p$ and $q$ in the plane and a nonnegative number $r$, the Cassini oval is the set of points $x$ that satisfy $d(x, p) d(x, q) = r^2$. In this paper, we study this set using the taxicab metric. We find that these sets have characteristics that are qualitatively similar to their Euclidean counterparts while also reflecting the underlying taxicab structure. We provide a geometric description of these sets and provide a characterization in terms of intersections and unions of a restricted family of such sets analogous to that found recently for taxicab Apollonian sets.</description>

      <title>The Z-Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is a powerful tool for comparing metric measure spaces which has found broad applications in data science and machine learning. Driven by the need to analyze datasets whose objects have increasingly complex structure (such as node and edge-attributed graphs), several variants of GW distance have been introduced in the recent literature. With a view toward establishing a general framework for the theory of GW-like distances, this paper considers a vast generalization of the notion of a metric measure space: for an arbitrary metric space $Z$, we define a $Z$-network to be a measure space endowed with a kernel valued in $Z$. We introduce a method for comparing $Z$-networks by defining a generalization of GW distance, which we refer to as $Z$-Gromov-Wasserstein ($Z$-GW) distance. This construction subsumes many previously known metrics and offers a unified approach to understanding their shared properties. This paper demonstrates that the $Z$-GW distance defines a metric on the space of $Z$-networks which retains desirable properties of $Z$, such as separability, completeness, and geodesicity. Many of these properties were unknown for existing variants of GW distance that fall under our framework. Our focus is on foundational theory, but our results also include computable lower bounds and approximations of the distance which will be useful for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any polyhedral norm, the bisector of two points is a polyhedral complex. We study combinatorial aspects of this complex. We investigate the sensitivity of the presence of labelled maximal cells in the bisector relative to the position of the two points. We thereby extend work of Criado, Joswig and Santos (2022) who showed that for the tropical distance function the presence of maximal cells is encoded by a polyhedral fan, the bisection fan. We initiate the study of bisection cones and bisection fans with respect to arbitrary polyhedral norms. In particular, we show that the bisection fan always exists for polyhedral norms in two dimensions. Furthermore, we determine the bisection fan of the $\ell_{1}$-norm and the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm as well as the discrete Wasserstein distance in arbitrary dimensions. Intricate combinatorial structures, such as the resonance arrangement, make their appearance. We apply our results to obtain bounds on the combinatorial complexity of the bisectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sharp lower bound for the injectivity radius in noncompact nonnegatively curved Riemannian manifolds involving their soul goes back to \v{S}arafutdinov. We generalize this bound to the setting of Alexandrov spaces. Our main theorem reads as follows. If the injectivity radius of an Alexandrov space of nonnegative curvature does not coincide with the one of its souls, then it is at least $ \pi K^{-1/2} $, where $ K $ is an upper curvature bound. We introduce the soul of Alexandrov spaces in some detail and compare two notions of injectivity radii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of planar convex bodies averaged over affine transformations. We establish lower and upper bounds on the latter quantities in terms of the geometric properties of the bodies in consideration. The second matter of study is the affine quadratic discrepancy of planar convex bodies, and we present sharp results on its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, averages over intervals of rotations are considered, addressing an open question of Bilyk and Mastrianni.</description>
