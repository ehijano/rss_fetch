      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The effect of latency on optimal order execution policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market participants regularly send bid and ask quotes to exchange-operated limit order books. This creates an optimization challenge where their potential profit is determined by their quoted price and how often their orders are successfully executed. The expected profit from successful execution at a favorable limit price needs to be balanced against two key risks: (1) the possibility that orders will remain unfilled, which hinders the trading agenda and leads to greater price uncertainty, and (2) the danger that limit orders will be executed as market orders, particularly in the presence of order submission latency, which in turn results in higher transaction costs. In this paper, we consider a stochastic optimal control problem where a risk-averse trader attempts to maximize profit while balancing risk. The market is modeled using Brownian motion to represent the price uncertainty. We analyze the relationship between fill probability, limit price, and order submission latency. We derive closed-form approximations of these quantities that perform well in the practical regime of interest. Then, we utilize a mean-variance method where our total reward function features a risk-tolerance parameter to quantify the combined risk and profit.</description>
