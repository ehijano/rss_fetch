      <title>High-Rate Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes Based on Massey's Convolutional Self-Orthogonal Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new class of high-rate spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes based on the convolutional self-orthogonal codes (CSOCs) first introduced by Massey. The SC-LDPC codes are constructed by treating the irregular graph corresponding to the parity-check matrix of a systematic rate R = (n - 1)/n CSOC as a convolutional protograph. The protograph can then be lifted using permutation matrices to generate a high-rate SC-LDPC code whose strength depends on the lifting factor. The SC-LDPC codes constructed in this fashion can be decoded using iterative belief propagation (BP) based sliding window decoding (SWD).
  A non-systematic version of a CSOC parity-check matrix is then proposed by making a slight modification to the systematic construction. The non-systematic parity-check matrix corresponds to a regular protograph whose degree profile depends on the rate and error-correcting capability of the underlying CSOC. Even though the parity-check matrix is in non-systematic form, we show how systematic encoding can still be performed. We also show that the non-systematic convolutional protograph has a guaranteed girth and free distance and that these properties carry over to the lifted versions.
  Finally, numerical results are included demonstrating that CSOC-based SC-LDPC codes (i) achieve excellent performance at very high rates, (ii) have performance at least as good as that of SC-LDPC codes constructed from convolutional protographs commonly found in the literature, and (iii) have iterative decoding thresholds comparable to those of existing SC-LDPC code designs.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Codes on CQ Channels via a New Correlation Bound for Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether Reed-Muller (RM) codes achieve capacity on binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels has drawn attention since it was resolved positively for the binary erasure channel by Kudekar et al. in 2016. In 2021, Reeves and Pfister extended this to prove the bit-error probability vanishes on BMS channels when the code rate is less than capacity. In 2023, Abbe and Sandon improved this to show the block-error probability also goes to zero. These results analyze decoding functions using symmetry and the nested structure of RM codes. In this work, we focus on binary-input symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels and the Holevo capacity. For a BSCQ, we consider observables that estimate the channel input in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). Using the orthogonal decomposition of these observables under a weighted inner product, we establish a recursive relation for the minimum MSE estimate of a single bit in the RM code. Our results show that any set of $2^{o(\sqrt{\log N})}$ bits can be decoded with a high probability when the code rate is less than the Holevo capacity.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for HMIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in emerging technologies, e.g., reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and holographic MIMO (HMIMO), facilitate unprecedented manipulation of electromagnetic (EM) waves, significantly enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. To accurately characterize the achievable performance limits of these systems, it is crucial to develop a universal EM-compliant channel model. This paper addresses this necessity by proposing a comprehensive EM channel model tailored for realistic multi-path environments, accounting for the combined effects of antenna array configurations and propagation conditions in HMIMO communications. Both polarization phenomena and spatial correlation are incorporated into this probabilistic channel model. Additionally, physical constraints of antenna configurations, such as mutual coupling effects and energy consumption, are integrated into the channel modeling framework. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic channel model, indicating that traditional Rician and Rayleigh fading models cannot accurately depict the channel characteristics and underestimate the channel capacity. More importantly, the proposed channel model outperforms free-space Green's functions in accurately depicting both near-field gain and multi-path effects in radiative near-field regions. These gains are much more evident in tri-polarized systems, highlighting the necessity of polarization interference elimination techniques. Moreover, the theoretical analysis accurately verifies that capacity decreases with expanding communication regions of two-user communications.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian-Sinc Pulse Shaping Filter for Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection. In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as {\em Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter}, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at $10^{-2}$ uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of $10^{-4}$ with rate-1/2 coding.</description>

      <title>Quantifying imperfect cognition via achieved information gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognition, the process of information processing in form of inference, communication, and memorization, is the central activity of any intelligence. Its physical realization in a brain, computer, or in any other intelligent system requires resources like time, energy, memory, bandwidth, money, and others. Due to limited resources, many real world intelligent systems perform only imperfect cognition. For understanding the trade-off between accuracy and resource investments in existing systems, e.g. in biology, as well as for the resource-aware optimal design of information processing systems, like computer algorithms and artificial neural networks, a quantification of information obtained in an imperfect cognitive operation is desirable. To this end, we propose the concept of achieved information gain (AIG) of a belief update, which is given by the amount of information obtained by updating from the initial knowledge state to the ideal one, minus the amount a change from the imperfect to the ideal state would yield. AIG has many properties desired for quantifying imperfect cognition. The ratio of achieved to ideally obtainable information measures cognitive fidelity and that of AIG to the necessary cognitive effort measures cognitive efficiency. We provide an axiomatic derivation of AIG, illustrate its application at common scenarios of posterior inaccuracies, and discuss the implication of cognitive efficiency for sustainable resource allocation in computational inference.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Landauer principle: Thermodynamic criteria of transmitting classical information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmitting energy and information are two essential aspects of nature. Recent findings suggest they are closely related, while a quantitative equivalence between them is still unknown. This thus motivates us to ask: Can information transmission tasks equal certain energy transmission tasks? We answer this question positively by bounding various one-shot classical capacities via different energy transmission tasks. Such bounds provide the physical implication that, in the one-shot regime, transmitting $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to $n\times k_BT\ln2$ transmitted energy. Unexpectedly, these bounds further uncover a dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between "transmitting" (rather than "erasing") information and energy. Finally, in the asymptotic regime, our findings further provide thermodynamic meanings for Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem and a series of strong converse properties as well as no-go theorems.</description>

Abstract: We have revisited the gradient-flow in information geometry from the perspective of Weyl symmetry. The gradient-flow equations are derived from the proposed action which is invariant under the Weyl's gauge transformations. In Weyl integrable geometry, we have related Amari's $\alpha$-connections in IG to the Weyl invariant connection on the Riemannian manifold equipped with the scaled metric.</description>

      <title>Comparing privacy notions for protection against reconstruction attacks in machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the machine learning community, reconstruction attacks are a principal concern and have been identified even in federated learning (FL), which was designed with privacy preservation in mind. In response to these threats, the privacy community recommends the use of differential privacy (DP) in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, termed DP-SGD. However, the proliferation of variants of DP in recent years\textemdash such as metric privacy\textemdash has made it challenging to conduct a fair comparison between different mechanisms due to the different meanings of the privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ across different variants. Thus, interpreting the practical implications of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ in the FL context and amongst variants of DP remains ambiguous. In this paper, we lay a foundational framework for comparing mechanisms with differing notions of privacy guarantees, namely $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and metric privacy. We provide two foundational means of comparison: firstly, via the well-established $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantees, made possible through the R\'enyi differential privacy framework; and secondly, via Bayes' capacity, which we identify as an appropriate measure for reconstruction threats.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Reliability via Hyperparameter Selection: Review and Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is a critical step in the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in the current era of foundational, pre-trained, models. By framing hyperparameter selection as a multiple hypothesis testing problem, recent research has shown that it is possible to provide statistical guarantees on population risk measures attained by the selected hyperparameter. This paper reviews the Learn-Then-Test (LTT) framework, which formalizes this approach, and explores several extensions tailored to engineering-relevant scenarios. These extensions encompass different risk measures and statistical guarantees, multi-objective optimization, the incorporation of prior knowledge and dependency structures into the hyperparameter selection process, as well as adaptivity. The paper also includes illustrative applications for communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.</description>

      <title>On the Price of Decentralization in Decentralized Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental limits on the error probabilities of a family of decentralized detection algorithms (eg., the social learning rule proposed by Lalitha et al. over directed graphs are investigated. In decentralized detection, a network of nodes locally exchanging information about the samples they observe with their neighbors to collectively infer the underlying unknown hypothesis. Each node in the network weighs the messages received from its neighbors to form its private belief and only requires knowledge of the data generating distribution of its observation. In this work, it is first shown that while the original social learning rule of Lalitha et al. achieves asymptotically vanishing error probabilities as the number of samples tends to infinity, it suffers a gap in the achievable error exponent compared to the centralized case. The gap is due to the network imbalance caused by the local weights that each node chooses to weigh the messages received from its neighbors. To close this gap, a modified learning rule is proposed and shown to achieve error exponents as large as those in the centralized setup. This implies that there is essentially no first-order penalty caused by decentralization in the exponentially decaying rate of error probabilities.</description>

      <title>OpenRANet: Neuralized Spectrum Access by Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation with Optimization-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next-generation radio access network (RAN), known as Open RAN, is poised to feature an AI-native interface for wireless cellular networks, including emerging satellite-terrestrial systems, making deep learning integral to its operation. In this paper, we address the nonconvex optimization challenge of joint subcarrier and power allocation in Open RAN, with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while ensuring users meet their transmission data rate requirements. We propose OpenRANet, an optimization-based deep learning model that integrates machine-learning techniques with iterative optimization algorithms. We start by transforming the original nonconvex problem into convex subproblems through decoupling, variable transformation, and relaxation techniques. These subproblems are then efficiently solved using iterative methods within the standard interference function framework, enabling the derivation of primal-dual solutions. These solutions integrate seamlessly as a convex optimization layer within OpenRANet, enhancing constraint adherence, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency by combining machine learning with convex analysis, as shown in numerical experiments. OpenRANet also serves as a foundation for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies for broader scenarios like multi-cell systems, satellite-terrestrial networks, and future Open RAN deployments with complex power consumption requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Service Rate Region (SRR) of Reed-Muller (RM) codes in the context of distributed storage systems. The SRR is a convex polytope comprising all achievable data access request rates under a given coding scheme. It represents a critical metric for evaluating system efficiency and scalability. Using the geometric properties of RM codes, we characterize recovery sets for data objects, including their existence, uniqueness, and enumeration. This analysis reveals a connection between recovery sets and minimum-weight codewords in the dual RM code, providing a framework for identifying small recovery sets. Using these results, we derive explicit and tight bounds for the maximal achievable demand for individual data objects, which define the maximal simplex within the service rate region.</description>

      <title>Generalization analysis of an unfolding network for analysis-based Compressed Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unfolding networks have shown promising results in the Compressed Sensing (CS) field. Yet, the investigation of their generalization ability is still in its infancy. In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.</description>

      <title>Robotic Exploration using Generalized Behavioral Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents and evaluates a novel strategy for robotic exploration that leverages human models of uncertainty perception. To do this, we introduce a measure of uncertainty that we term "Behavioral entropy", which builds on Prelec's probability weighting from Behavioral Economics. We show that the new operator is an admissible generalized entropy, analyze its theoretical properties and compare it with other common formulations such as Shannon's and Renyi's. In particular, we discuss how the new formulation is more expressive in the sense of measures of sensitivity and perceptiveness to uncertainty introduced here. Then we use Behavioral entropy to define a new type of utility function that can guide a frontier-based environment exploration process. The approach's benefits are illustrated and compared in a Proof-of-Concept and ROS-Unity simulation environment with a Clearpath Warthog robot. We show that the robot equipped with Behavioral entropy explores faster than Shannon and Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Ensembling Portfolio Strategies for Long-Term Investments: A Distribution-Free Preference Framework for Decision-Making and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of ensembling multiple strategies for sequential portfolios to outperform individual strategies in terms of long-term wealth. Due to the uncertainty of strategies' performances in the future market, which are often based on specific models and statistical assumptions, investors often mitigate risk and enhance robustness by combining multiple strategies, akin to common approaches in collective learning prediction. However, the absence of a distribution-free and consistent preference framework complicates decisions of combination due to the ambiguous objective. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework for decision-making in combining strategies, irrespective of market conditions, by establishing the investor's preference between decisions and then forming a clear objective. Through this framework, we propose a combinatorial strategy construction, free from statistical assumptions, for any scale of component strategies, even infinite, such that it meets the determined criterion. Finally, we test the proposed strategy along with its accelerated variant and some other multi-strategies. The numerical experiments show results in favor of the proposed strategies, albeit with small tradeoffs in their Sharpe ratios, in which their cumulative wealths eventually exceed those of the best component strategies while the accelerated strategy significantly improves performance.</description>

      <title>InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.</description>

      <title>Spatial Network Calculus: Toward Deterministic Wireless Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical network calculus to spatial scenarios, focusing on wireless networks with heterogeneous traffic and varying transmit power levels. Building on spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing spatial regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes. We derive deterministic performance guarantees for all links in complex and heterogeneous wireless networks.</description>
