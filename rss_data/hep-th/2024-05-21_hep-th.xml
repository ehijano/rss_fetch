      <title>On The Perturbations of Gibbons-Maeda Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of perturbations around black hole backgrounds in general relativity and Einstein-Maxwell theory has a long history, going back to the work of Regge and Wheeler in the 1950s. As part of a broader investigation of perturbations around black holes in supergravity, we describe here our results for the perturbations around the Gibbons-Maeda static charged black holes in a class of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories. Our analysis follows the general strategy developed by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos for the perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Here, the analysis is considerably more involved, because of the presence of the dilaton field, which couples to the other polar modes. We nonetheless find that the problem is completely solvable, in the sense that one can separate variables and eventually describe all the perturbations in terms of diagonalised second-order radial equations. We are able to prove the mode stability of all the Gibbons-Maeda black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>First order phase transition with functional renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group method, more specifically the Wegner-Houghton equation, is used to find first order phase transitions in a simple scalar field theory with a polynomial potential. An improved definition of the running parameters allows us to explore the renormalization group flow down to the IR end point and to locate phase transitions. Beyond the expected first order transition further radiative correction generated first and second order transitions are found. The phase diagram is reviewed by a Monte-Carlo simulation of the lattice regulated version of the theory but the serious slow down of the convergence prevents us to obtain conclusive results from the simulation.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order asymptotic observables are quasi-isomorphic to time-ordered amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic observables in quantum field theory beyond the familiar $S$-matrix have recently attracted much interest, for instance in the context of gravity waveforms. Such observables can be understood in terms of Schwinger-Keldysh-type 'amplitudes' computed by a set of modified Feynman rules involving cut internal legs and external legs labelled by time-folds.
  In parallel, a homotopy-algebraic understanding of perturbative quantum field theory has emerged in recent years. In particular, passing through homotopy transfer, the $S$-matrix of a perturbative quantum field theory can be understood as the minimal model of an associated (quantum) $L_\infty$-algebra.
  Here we bring these two developments together. In particular, we show that Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes are naturally encoded in an $L_\infty$-algebra, similar to ordinary scattering amplitudes. As before, they are computed via homotopy transfer, but using deformation-retract data that are not canonical (in contrast to the conventional $S$-matrix). We further show that the $L_\infty$-algebras encoding Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes and ordinary amplitudes are quasi-isomorphic (meaning, in a suitable sense, equivalent). This entails a set of recursion relations that enable one to compute Schwinger-Keldysh amplitudes in terms of ordinary amplitudes or vice versa.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Higher $\varepsilon$-poles and logarithms in the MS-like schemes from the algebraic structure of the renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of renormalization constants within the MS-like renormalization prescriptions for a version of dimensional regularization in which the dimensionful regularization parameter $\Lambda$ differs from the renormalization point $\mu$. Namely, we rewrite the all-loop equations relating coefficients at higher $\varepsilon$-poles and higher powers of $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in a simple unified form. It is argued that this form follows from the algebraic structure of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Rapid-Turn Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to $1$)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.</description>

      <title>Swampland and the Geometry of Marked Moduli Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a marked moduli space as the parameter space of a physical theory together with all of its observables. In geometric examples, this coincides with the mathematical notion of Teichm\"uller space. We propose two new Swampland principles about the geometry of marked moduli spaces: We conjecture that a marked moduli space is always contractible, and moreover, that there is a unique geodesic connecting any pair of points in it with respect to its physical metric. We provide strong evidence for these conjectures for theories with 8 or more supercharges.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling amplitudes through localised external potentials from Feynman diagram summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently there is no general theory of quantum tunnelling of a particle through a potential barrier which is compatible with QFT. We present a complete calculation of tunnelling amplitudes for a scalar field for some simple potentials using quantum field-theoretic methods. Using the perturbative S-matrix formalism, starting with the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian, we show that an infinite summation of Feynman diagrams can recover tunnelling amplitudes consistent with relativistic quantum mechanics. While this work does not include many-particle effects arising from a fully quantised QFT, it is necessary to investigate QFT corrections to tunnelling amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Graviton physics: Quantum field theory of gravitons, graviton noise and gravitational decoherence -- a concise tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy capable of probing into the strong field dynamics of black holes and neutron stars. It has opened up an exciting new window for laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity. In recent years there are two interesting proposals aimed at revealing the quantum natures of perturbative gravity: 1) theoretical predictions in how graviton noise from the early universe after the vacuum of the gravitational field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; 2) experimental proposals using the quantum entanglement between two masses each in a superposition state. The first proposal invokes the stochastic properties of quantum fields, the second invokes a key concept of quantum information. An equally basic and interesting idea is to ask whether and how gravity might be responsible for a quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity is universal. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena. To fully appreciate these exciting developments requires a working knowledge in classical GR, QF theory and QI plus some familiarity with stochastic processes, namely, noise in quantum fields. Traditionally a new researcher may be conversant in one or two of these four subjects: GR, QFT, QI, SP, depending on his/her background. This tutorial attempts to provide the necessary connections between them, helping an engaging reader from any one of these four subjects to leapfrog to the frontier of these interdisciplinary research topics. Here we shall treat the three topics listed in the title, save gravitational entanglement, because its nature and implications proclaimed in relation to quantum gravity still contain many controversial elements.</description>

      <title>Regularized Entanglement Entropy of Electron-Positron Scattering with a Witness Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized quantum information metrics are calculated for the scattering process $e^-e^+ \rightarrow \gamma,Z\rightarrow \mu^-\mu^+$ that has a witness photon entangled with the initial electron-positron state. Unitarity implies the correct regularization of divergences that appear in both the final density matrix and von Neumann entanglement entropies. The entropies are found to quantify uncertainty or randomness. The variation of information, entanglement entropy, and correlation between the muon's and witness photon's helicities are found to convey equivalent information. The magnitude of the muon's expected helicity rises (falls) as the helicity entropy falls (rises). Area, or the scattering cross section, is a source of entropy for the muon's helicity entropy and momentum entropy. The muon's differential angular entropy distribution is similar to the differential angular cross section distribution, capturing the forward-backward asymmetry at high center of mass energies.</description>

      <title>Wilson line-based action for gluodynamics at the quantum level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently derived a new action for gluodynamics by canonically transforming the Yang-Mills action on light-cone. The transformation elimated triple gluons vertices and replaced the gauge fields with Wilson lines. This greatly reduced the number of diagrams required to compute tree level amplitudes. However, at the quantum level, the action turned out to be incomplete. We present two ways, based on one-loop effective action approach, to systematically develop quantum correction to our action. The first method retains Yang-Mills vertices in the loop, while the second method explicitly incorporates the interaction vertices of our action into the loop. We demonstrate that both approaches are equivalent, although the former appears to be more efficient for computing higher-multiplicity one-loop amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions with $W$-representations and Nekrasov partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the generalized $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed partition functions through $W$ representations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled by $N$-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the $4d$ and $5d$ Nekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our $\beta$ and $(q,t)$-deformed $W$-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Confinement for 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ with a Symmetric tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ confining gauge theories with a matter field in the rank-two index symmetric representation. The models found here are obtained from the application of the duplication formula for hyperbolic gamma functions from \emph{parent} confining models, with antisymmetric fields and (anti)-fundamental matter by \emph{freezing} some of the mass parameters for the latter. We find a series of identities that can give rise to candidate confining theories with $SU(N)$ gauge group, a symmetric tensor and in addition other charged matter fields, in general with a non-vanishing superpotential. We provide for each case further checks of the proposed dualities, by studying the Coulomb branch and by deconfining the tensorial matter by using other known 3d dualities. From the final picture a refined classification emerges, distinguishing the confining theories obtained in the paper in classes with common properties.</description>

      <title>The Baryon Junction and String Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. We show that the effective theory of such junctions is very predictive with only one new parameter, the junction's mass, controlling the first couple of terms in the expansion in the system size. By open-closed duality these considerations about the baryon junction map to interaction vertices of closed strings. Therefore, we calculate the interaction vertices of closed strings in theories such as Yang-Mills theory. We find some surprising selection rules for string interactions in 3+1 dimensions. Requiring perturbative stability and that the string coupling is weak, we suggest constraints on the junction's mass.</description>

Abstract: We study the linearized gravity theory in the Newman-Unti gauge in the near horizon region of the de Sitter spacetime. The linearized Einstein equation involves the cosmological constant. The near horizon symmetry consists of near horizon supertranslation and near horizon superrotation. We compute the near horizon supertranslation charge and find the proper near horizon fall-off conditions which uncover a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon supertranslation.</description>

      <title>Holographic massive plasma state in Friedman Universe: cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particle and antiparticle pair production and oscillation on the horizon form a holographic and massive pair plasma state in the Friedman Universe. Via this state, the Einstein cosmology term (dark energy) interacts with matter and radiation and is time-varying $\tilde\Lambda$ in the Universe's evolution. It is determined by a close set of ordinary differential equations for dark energy, matter, and radiation energy densities. The solutions are unique, provided the initial conditions given by observations. In inflation and reheating, dark energy density decreases from the inflation scale, converting to matter and radiation energy densities. In standard cosmology, matter and radiation energy densities convert to dark energy density, reaching the present Universe. By comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, quintessence and dark energy interacting models, we show that these results can be the possible solutions for cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems.</description>

      <title>Physics of a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the onset of the subject, granular media have been defying the toolkit of statistical mechanics thus preventing from understanding their thermodynamical and rheological properties and making them one of the key remaining mysteries in science. In the present work, we offer a resolution to this problem in the case of static granular media by considering a collective behavior of 2D identical balls forming a granular pile in the gravity field, which allows us to develop its thermodynamics and rheology from the first principles. Besides the uncertainty due to rough substrate on which the pile is built, we uncover another one due to ambiguities occurring in the positions of some interior balls. Both are responsible for the thermodynamic description of the granular pile, which proves to be anything but ordinary. In particular, we show that a pile is characterized by three temperatures: one is infinite, the other is negative, and the third is of higher-order. Also, considering the fields of ball displacements $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and the normal force deviations $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$ from the ideal isosceles triangular structure of a regular pile reveals the hyperbolic nature of the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$-field and ability of the $\delta\boldsymbol{N}$-field to change the characteristic type from hyperbolic to elliptic. The latter property not only explains the origin of force chains and provides an adequate description of the rheology of static granular media, but turned out to be instrumental for understanding of granular media thermodynamics. Our model should provide a basis for further grasping of granular media properties, in general.</description>

      <title>Vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional $SU(3)$ gauge theory on a magnetized torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of an eight-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory with a compactified four-dimensional torus as the extra dimensions. As a non-trivial background configuration of the gauge field of an $SU(n)$ gauge group, we suppose a magnetic flux in two extra dimensions, and continuous Wilson line phases are also involved. We introduce matter fields and calculate the mass spectrum of low-energy modes appearing in a four-dimensional effective theory in an $SU(3)$ model as an explicit example. As expected, potentially tachyonic states in four-dimensional modes appear from extra-dimensional gauge fields that couple to the flux background since the gauge group is simply connected. The Wilson line phases give a non-vanishing contribution to their masses, and we have a low-energy mass spectrum without tachyonic states, given that these phases take an appropriate value. To verify the validity of the values of the Wilson line phases, we examine the one-loop effective potential for these phases and explicitly show the contribution from each type of field present in our model. It is clarified that, although there seems to be no local minimum in the potential for the Wilson line phases in the pure Yang-Mills case, by including matter fields, we could find a vacuum configuration where tachyonic states disappear. Hence, non-abelian gauge theory with flux background can be used to construct phenomenologically interesting theories beyond the standard model, such as gauge-Higgs unification and grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebras, Z-algebra Structure and Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) associated with an arbitrary toroidal algebra g_tor. We show that U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) contains two elliptic quantum algebras associated with a corresponding affine Lie algebra bg as subalgebras. They are analogue of the horizontal and the vertical subalgebras in the quantum toroidal algebra U_{q,\kappa}(g_tor). A Hopf algebroid structure is introduced as a co-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) using the Drinfeld comultiplication. We also investigate the Z-algebra structure of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) and show that the Z-algebra governs the irreducibility of the level (k(\not=0),l)-infinite dimensional U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor)-modules in the same way as in the elliptic quantum group U_{q,p}(g). As an example, we construct the level (1,l) irreducible representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_tor) for the simply laced gtor. We also construct the level (0,1) representation of U_{q,\kappa,p}(g_N,tor) and discuss a conjecture on its geometric interpretation as an action on the torus equivariant elliptic cohomology of the affine A_{N-1} quiver variety.</description>

Abstract: We expose the elliptic quantum groups in the Drinfeld realization associated with both the affine Lie algebra \g and the toroidal algebra \g_tor. There the level-0 and level \not=0 representations appear in a unified way so that one can define the vertex operators as intertwining operators of them. The vertex operators are key for many applications such as a derivation of the elliptic weight functions, integral solutions of the (elliptic) q-KZ equation and a formulation of algebraic analysis of the elliptic solvable lattice models. Identifying the elliptic weight functions with the elliptic stable envelopes we make a correspondence between the level-0 representation of the elliptic quantum group and the equivariant elliptic cohomology. We also emphasize a characterization of the elliptic quantum groups as $q$-deformations of the W-algebras.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This solves a 90-year old mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>

Abstract: In quantum gravity, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for generic initial data, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated for varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence relation between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>New Uncertainty Principle for a particle on a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy levels for Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates and we use the tetrads formalism. Solving a second-order differential equation for the two components of the Dirac spinor, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, and the relativistic energy levels of the fermion and antifermion, where such levels are quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the two components of the spinor), curvature and rotation parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (describes the conical curvature and the angular momentum of the spinning cosmic string), and on the vorticity parameter $\Omega$ (describes the G\"odel-type spacetime). In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of $\Omega$ (i.e., $\Omega$ acts as a kind of ``external field or potential''). We see that for $m_j&gt;0$, the energy levels do not depend on $s$ and $u$; however, depend on $n$, $m_j$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$. In this case, $\alpha$ breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels and such levels can increase infinitely in the limit $\frac{4\Omega\beta}{\alpha}\to 1$. Already for $m_j&lt;0$, we see that the energy levels depends on $s$, $u$ and $n$; however, it no longer depends on $m_j$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In this case, it is as if the fermion ``lives only in a flat G\"odel-type spacetime''. Besides, we also study the low-energy or nonrelativistic limit of the system. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of energy levels as a function of $\Omega$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index theorem corresponding to the chiral symmetry of a continuum formulation of staggered fermions called K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, which have been recently investigated as an ingredient in lattice constructions of chiral gauge theories. We point out that there are two notions of chiral symmetry for K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, both having a mixed perturbative anomaly with gravity leading to index theorems on closed manifolds. By formulating these theories on a manifold with boundary, we find the APS index theorems corresponding to each of these symmetries, necessary for a complete picture of anomaly inflow, using a recently discovered physics-motivated proof. We comment on a fundamental difference between the nature of these two symmetries by showing that a sensible local, symmetric boundary condition only exists for one of the two symmetries. This sheds light on how these symmetries behave under lattice discretization, and in particular on their use for recent symmetric-mass generation proposals.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by wormholes and its shadow due to dark matter within modified symmetric teleparallel gravity formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we propose a new generalised version of unified Cantor potential (GUCP), where $\frac{1}{\rho^{\mu+\nu G}}\ \ \ (\mu,\ \nu $ are real numbers) portion of the potential is removed and is characterised by a integer N which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we calculate a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We further show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave-vector ($k$) through analytical derivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of quenched elastic disorder on the nature of the crumpling-to-flat transition of $D$-dimensional polymerized membranes using a two-loop computation near the upper critical dimension $D_c=4$. While the pure system undergoes fluctuation-induced first order transitions below $D_c$ and for an embedding dimension $d&lt;d_{c,pure}\simeq 218.2$, one observes, in presence of disorder, the emergence of various regions of second order governed by a disordered stable fixed point for $d&lt;d_{c1}\sim d_{c,pure}$. This opens the possibility of a new universality class associated with the crumpling-to-flat transition of disordered membranes in $d=3$</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <title>QuanEstimation.jl: An open-source Julia framework for quantum parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transition of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Generating large primordial fluctuations in single-field inflation for PBH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scale. As a result we show that single-field inflation model realizing PBH formation is severely constrained by the quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon properties of trajectories with finite force relevant for Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Banados-SIlk-West (BSW) effect, two particles moving towards a black hole, can collide near the horizon with an unbounded energy in the center of mass frame. This requires one of particles to have fine-tuned parameters in such a way that the time component of generalized momentum is zero $X=0$. Thus the existence of such trjectories is a necessary condition for the BSW effect. However, it is insufficient since the forward-in-time condition requires $X&gt;0$ outside the horizon. We examine this condition for different types of partricles and horizons and find configurations for which the BSW effect is possible. In doing so, we take into account a finite force of unspesified nature exerted on particles. It includes relationships between numbers characterizing the rate with which four-velocity, acceleration and metric functions change near the horizon. For some aforementioned relations, parameters of a system control the sign of $X$, in other cases they are required for $X$ to be real quantity. In the simplest case of free particles the BSW effect for the Kerr or Kerr-Newman black hole is impossible if a fine-tuned particle has a negative energy, so in this sense combination of the Penrose process and the BSW effect is forbidden.</description>

Abstract: The most widely studied formation mechanism of a primordial black hole is collapse of large-amplitude perturbation on small scales generated in single-field inflation. In this Letter, we calculate one-loop correction to the large-scale power spectrum in a model with sharp transition of the second slow-roll parameter. We find that models producing an appreciable amount of primordial black holes induce nonperturbative coupling on a large scale probed by cosmic microwave background radiation. Our result implies that a small-scale power spectrum can be constrained by large-scale cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We study two-dimensional string theory on a time-dependent background, whose worldsheet description consists of Liouville theory at central charge c = 1 and Liouville theory at central charge c = 25, together with the conformal ghosts. We compute the tree-level three-point and four-point cosmological wavefunctions in string perturbation theory. The latter is evaluated numerically by decomposing the Liouville four-point correlation functions into Virasoro conformal blocks and three-point function coefficients and integrating over the moduli space of the four-punctured sphere string diagram. This computation numerically confirms a surprisingly simple conjectural result for the four-point wavefunction whose physical interpretation remains to be clarified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be formed from the collapse of large-amplitude perturbation on small scales in the early Universe. Such an enhanced spectrum can be realized by introducing a flat region in the potential of single-field inflation, which makes the inflaton go into a temporary ultraslow-roll period. In this paper, we calculate the bispectrum of curvature perturbation in such a scenario. We explicitly confirm that bispectrum satisfies Maldacena's theorem. At the end of the ultraslow-roll period, the bispectrum is generated by bulk interaction and field redefinition. At the end of inflation, bispectrum is generated only by bulk interaction. We also calculate the one-loop correction to the power spectrum from the bispectrum, called the source method. We find it consistent with the calculation of the one-loop correction from the second-order expansion of in-in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a classical fractional particle model in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, extending the Newtonian particle concept with the incorporation of the fractional Laplacian. A comprehensive discussion on kinetic properties, including linear momentum and kinetic energy, is provided. We further derive the equations of motion and discuss the symmetries of the system. The Green's function method is employed to solve the equations of motion in a general case. We illustrate the theory with three important examples: the free fractional particle, the fractional harmonic oscillator, and the charged fractional particle that interacts locally with the electromagnetic field. We use the results of the extension problem by Caffarelli and Silvestre, to construct the associated classical local sigma model for the fractional particle. The sigma model is then quantized using the canonical quantization method, and we compute the vacuum energy at the boundary.</description>

      <title>State-independent Black Hole Interiors from the Crossed Product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opinion is divided about the nature of state dependence in the black hole interior. Some argue that it is a necessary feature, while others argue it is a bug. In this paper, we consider the extended half-sided modular translation $U(s_0)$ (with $s_0 &gt; 0$) of Leutheusser and Liu that takes us inside the horizon. We note that we can use this operator to construct a modular Hamiltonian $H$ and a conjugation $J$ on the infalling time-evolved wedges. The original thermofield double translates to a new cyclic and separating vector in the shifted algebra. We use these objects and the Connes cocycle to repeat Witten's crossed product construction in this new setting, and to obtain a Type II$_\infty$ algebra that is independent of the various choices, in particular that of the cyclic separating vector. Our emergent times are implicitly boundary-dressed. But if one admits an ``extra'' observer in the interior, we argue that the (state-independent) algebra can be Type I or Type II$_1$ instead of Type II$_\infty$, depending on whether the observer's light cone contains an entire Cauchy slice or not. Along with these general considerations, we present some specific calculations in the setting of the Poincare BTZ black hole. We identify a generalization of modular translations in BTZ-Kruskal coordinates that is pointwise (as opposed to non-local) and is analytically tractable, exploiting a connection with the covering AdS-space. These evolutions can reach the singularity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study integrability and non-integrability for type-IIA supergravity background dual to deformed plane wave matrix model. From the bulk perspective, we estimate various chaos indicators that clearly shows chaotic string dynamics in the limit of small value of the parameter $L$ present in the theory. On the other hand, the string dynamics exhibits a non-chaotic motion for the large value of the parameter $L$ and therefore presumably an underlying integrable structure. Our findings reveals that the parameter $L$ in the type-IIA background acts as an interpolation between a non-integrable theory to an integrable theory in dual SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Closed FRW holography: A time-dependent ER=EPR realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a recent de Sitter holographic proposal and entanglement entropy prescription to generic closed FRW cosmologies in arbitrary dimensions, and propose that for large classes of bouncing and Big Bang/Big Crunch cosmologies, the full spacetime can be encoded holographically on two holographic screens, associated to two antipodal observers. In the expanding phase, the two screens lie at the apparent horizons. In the contracting phase, there is an infinite number of possible trajectories of the holographic screens, which can be grouped in equivalence classes. In each class the effective holographic theory can be derived from a pair of ``parent'' screens on the apparent horizons. A number of cases including moduli dominated cosmologies escape our discussion, and it is expected that two antipodal observers and their associated screens do not suffice to reconstruct these cosmologies. The leading contributions to the entanglement entropy between the screens arise from a minimal extremal trapped or anti-trapped surface lying in the region between them. This picture entails a time-dependent realization of the ER=EPR conjecture, where an effective geometrical bridge connecting the screens via the minimal extremal surface emerges from entanglement. For the Big Crunch contracting cases, the screens disentangle and the geometrical bridge closes off when the minimal extremal trapped sphere hits the Big Crunch singularity at a finite time before the collapse of the Universe. Semiclassical, thermal corrections are incorporated in the cases of radiation dominated cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Warped Conformal Symmetries of the Accelerating Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies on the holographic descriptions of Kerr black holes indicate that the conformal or the warped conformal symmetries are responsible for the Kerr black hole physics at both background and perturbation levels. In the present paper, we extend the validity of these studies to the case of accelerating Kerr black hole. By invoking a set of non-trivial diffeomorphisms near the horizon bifurcation surface of the accelerating Kerr black hole, the Dirac brackets among charges of the diffeomorphisms form the symmetry algebra of a warped CFT which consists of one Virasoro and one Kac-Moody algebra with central extensions. This provides the evidence for warped CFTs being possible holographic dual to accelerating Kerr black holes. The thermal entropy formula of the warped CFT fixed by modular parameters and vacuum charges reproduces the entropy of the rotating black hole with acceleration.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the presence of non-conformality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behaviour of a chaotic system and its effect on existing quantum correlation has been holographically studied in presence of non-conformality. Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the non-conformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both the Lyapunov exponent and as well as butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$ known as Gubser bound in the literature. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the thermo mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it has been observed. Finally, the obtained results for the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity have also been computed from the pole-skipping analysis. The results from the two approaches agree with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) that have been proposed in physical contexts involving strong fields are causal for weak fields but acausal for strong fields. We show that for any such theory there is a unique causal and self-dual (electromagnetic duality invariant) theory with the same Lagrangian at zero magnetic field. This follows from a construction of the general causal self-dual NLED, which shows that strong-field causality is implied by weak-field causality for self-dual theories. We illustrate our results with explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reassess the problem of symmetry restoration induced by observers' acceleration within the context of interacting quantum field theories in Minkowski spacetime. We argue that the imposition of a frame-independent renormalization condition negates any observed symmetry restoration by a Rindler observer. Technically, we compute the one-loop effective potential of a $\lambda\varphi^4$ theory for an accelerated observer, employing a distinct methodology from prior investigations. Emphasizing the intricacies of the model's renormalization, the analysis offers novel insights into the interplay between acceleration and spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: A closed string worldsheet of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures can be presented as a contact interaction in which $n$ semi-infinite cylinders are glued together in a specific way via the Strebel differential on it, if $n\geq1,\ 2g-2+n&gt;0$. We construct a string field theory of closed strings such that all the Feynman diagrams are represented by such contact interactions. In order to do so, we define off-shell amplitudes in the underlying string theory using the combinatorial Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates to describe the moduli space and derive a recursion relation satisfied by them. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck formalism, we construct a string field theory from which the recursion relation can be deduced through the Schwinger-Dyson equation. The Fokker-Planck Hamiltonian consists of kinetic terms and three string interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement islands and cutoff branes from path-integral optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was proposed that, the AdS/BCFT correspondence can be simulated by a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$, where the cut-off brane plays the role of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane \cite{Basu:2022crn}. In this paper, we focus on the Weyl transformation that optimizes the path integral computation of the reduced density matrix for a single interval in a holographic CFT$_2$. When we take the limit that one of the endpoint of the interval goes to infinity (a half line), such a holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ matches the AdS/BCFT configuration for a BCFT with one boundary. Without taking the limit, the induced cutoff brane becomes a circle passing through the two endpoints of the interval. We assume that the cutoff brane also plays the same role as the KR brane in AdS/BCFT, hence the path-integral-optimized purification for the interval is in the island phase. This explains the appearance of negative mutual information observed in \cite{Camargo:2022mme}. We check that, the entanglement entropy and the balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE) calculated via the island formulas, exactly match with the RT formula and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), which are allowed to anchor on the cutoff brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page curve describing the process of black hole evaporation is derived in terms of a family, parametrized in terms of the evaporation time, of finite type II_1 factors, associated, respectively, to the entanglement wedges of the black hole and the radiation. The so defined Page curve measures the relative continuous dimension of the black hole and the radiation along the evaporation process. The transfer of information is quantitatively defined in terms of the Murray von Neumann parameter describing the change of the spatial properties of the factors during the evaporation. In the simplest case the generator of the evaporation process is defined in terms of the action of the fundamental group of the hyperfinite type II_1 factor. In this setup the Page curve describes a phase transition with the transfer of information as order parameter. We discuss the limits of either a type I or a type III description of the black hole evaporation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze deformations of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) from the perspective of classical bosonic closed string field theory (SFT). The latter can be viewed as a version of Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) improved conformal perturbation theory, where the renormalization scheme is defined through the choice of string vertices in the construction of SFT. Furthermore, the CFT data at the RG fixed point can be recovered from the spectrum and amplitudes of string field fluctuations. As applications, we construct the Horowitz-Polchinski "string star" solution in SFT, and a solution of tachyon-dilaton condensation that deforms the noncompact boson to minimal models by creating a pair of "Runkel-Watts walls".</description>

Abstract: Recently, we performed a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models involving $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals. The realization was derived and studied by using Ward identities, which do not allow one to fix integration contours, these latter were chosen to be real axis for one $\beta$-ensemble and imaginary axis for the other one basing on some particular checks. Here, we evaluate the $\beta$-ensemble integrals directly using a conjecture by I.G. Macdonald, and explain that another choice of integration contours is also possible.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a perturbative expansion of the Lanczos coefficients and the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional conformal field theories under integrable deformations. Specifically, we explore the consequences of $T{\bar{T}}$, $J{\bar{T}}$, and $J{\bar{J}}$ deformations, focusing on first-order corrections in the deformation parameter. Under $T\bar{T}$ deformation, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$ exhibit unexpected behavior, deviating from linear growth within the valid perturbative regime. Notably, the Krylov exponent characterizing the rate of exponential growth of complexity surpasses that of the undeformed theory for positive value of deformation parameter, suggesting a potential violation of the conjectured operator growth bound within the realm of perturbative analysis. One may attribute this to the existence of logarithmic branch points along with higher order poles in the autocorrelation function compared to the undeformed case. In contrast to this, both $J{\bar{J}}$ and $J{\bar{T}}$ deformations induce no first order correction to either the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients at large-$n$ or the Krylov exponent and hence the results for these two deformations align with those of the undeformed theory.</description>

Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only far from the black hole horizon, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom closer to the horizon. The later degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied with additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear massive scalar charged perturbations of Topological Stars in the fuzzball and in the black hole (Black String) regimes. The objects that naturally couple to the electric 3-form field strength of these solutions are charged strings, wound around the compact direction. We explore the possibility of instabilities of these solutions, in analogy with the charge instability already highlighted for other non-BPS geometries like JMaRT. This issue is addressed by calculating quasi-normal mode frequencies with a variety of techniques: WKB approximation, direct integration, Leaver method and by exploiting the recently discovered correspondence between black hole-fuzzball perturbation theory and quantum Seiberg-Witten curves. All mode frequencies we find have negative imaginary parts, implying an exponential decay in time. This suggests a linear stability of Topological Stars also in this new scenario. In addition, we study the charge superradiance for the Black String. We compute the amplification factor with the numerical integration method and a quantum Seiberg-Witten motivated definition including instantonic corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

Abstract: We revisit pure quantum cosmology in three dimensions. The Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be solved perturbatively and the dynamics reduces to a particle on moduli space. Its time evolution is equivalent to the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Focusing on spacetimes with torus slices, we show that inflationary cosmologies correspond to particle trajectories in Artin's billiard. The resulting automorphic dynamics is developed both from a first and second quantized perspectives. Our main application is to give an interpretation for the Hartle-Hawking state which is here the analytic continuation of the Maloney-Witten partition function. We obtain its spectral decomposition and an exact representation as an average involving the M\"obius function.</description>

Abstract: We explain simple semi-classical rules to estimate the lifetime of any given highly-excited quantum state of the string spectrum in flat spacetime. We discuss both the decays by splitting into two massive states and by massless emission. As an application, we study a solution describing a rotating and pulsating ellipse which becomes folded at an instant of time -- the ``squashing ellipse''. This string interpolates between the folded string with maximum angular momentum and the pulsating circular string. We explicitly compute the quantum decay rate for the corresponding quantum state, and verify the basic rules that we propose. Finally, we give a more general (4-parameter) family of closed string solutions representing rotating and pulsating elliptical strings.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group Perspective on Gravitational Critical Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose extremal black holes (BH) as critical points of a new class of gravitational collapses. The conjecture is made by observing the Continuous Self Similarity (CSS) and Discrete Self Similarity (DSS) behaviours of perturbations of an extremal black hole spacetime and compare them to similar properties of Choptuik-type critical solutions. By performing analytical perturbation studies on extremal black holes, we explicitly show that the DSS solution found here can be interpreted as renormalization group (RG) limit cycles, and the transition between CSS and DSS regimes occurs as the stable and unstable fixed points collide and move to the complex plane. We argue that the DSS solutions found in spherically symmetric gravitational collapses can be similarly interpreted. We identify various phenomena in non-gravitational systems with RG limit cycles, including DSS correlation function, DSS scaling laws in correlation length and order parameters, which are observed in gravitational critical collapses. We also discuss a version of gravitational Efimov effect.</description>

      <title>Numerators in parametric representations of Feynman diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric representation has been used since a long time for the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. As a dimension independent intermediate representation, it allows a clear description of singularities. Recently, it has become a choice tool for the investigation of the type of transcendent numbers appearing in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams. The inclusion of numerators has however stagnated since the ground work of Nakanishi. I here show how to greatly simplify the formulas through the use of Dodgson identities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem.

      <title>Cluster transformations, the tetrahedron equation and three-dimensional gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define three families of quivers in which the braid relations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are realized by mutations and automorphisms. A sequence of eight braid moves on a reduced word for the longest element of $S_4$ yields three trivial cluster transformations with 8, 32 and 32 mutations. For each of these cluster transformations, a unitary operator representing a single braid move in a quantum mechanical system solves the tetrahedron equation. The solutions thus obtained are constructed from the noncompact quantum dilogarithm and can be identified with the partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on a squashed three-sphere.</description>

      <title>Competitions between topological states revisited by effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theory models capable of realizing various gapless topological states are presented in this work. After reviewing the effective field models of the Weyl and nodal line semimetal states, we study the competition of these two semimetal states in effective field theories. When the one form field giving rise to the Weyl nodes lie perpendicular to the plane where the nodal ring lives, the nodal ring and Weyl nodes could coexist as the mirror symmetry responsible for the nodal ring is not broken. New phases including a three-node state and a triple degenerate state exist. The nodal ring is immediately destroyed when the one form field lies in the plane of the ring. However, we show that in an eight-component spinor model, Weyl nodes and nodal rings could still coexist even when the one form field is parallel to the plane, due to the expanded symmetry. Finally we calculate the topological invariants in these models and in particular confirm the interesting nontrivial topology of the three-node state and the triple-degenerate node.</description>

      <title>Why magnetic monopole becomes dyon in topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Witten effect predicts that a magnetic monopole acquires a fractional electric charge inside topological insulators.
  In this work, we give a microscopic description of this phenomenon, as well as an analogous two-dimensional system with a vortex. We solve the Dirac equation of electron field both analytically in continuum and numerically on a lattice, by adding the Wilson term and smearing the gauge field within a finite range to regularize the short-distance behavior of the system. Our results reveal that the Wilson term induces a strong positive mass shift, creating a domain-wall around the monopole/vortex. This small, yet finite-sized domain-wall localizes the chiral zero modes and ensures their stability through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, whose cobordism invariance is crucial in explaining why the electric charge is fractional.</description>

      <title>Preliminary analyses on dynamics and thermodynamics of rotating regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic and thermodynamic laws governing rotating regular black holes. By analyzing dynamic properties, i.e., the interaction between scalar particles and rotating regular black holes, we establish the criteria that determine whether such black holes satisfy the laws of thermodynamics or not. In addition, we provide the general form of conserved quantities related to rotating regular black holes, including the relevant flows associated with neutral scalar particles. Meanwhile, we reexamine the relationship between the third law of thermodynamics and weak cosmic censorship conjecture for rotating regular black holes. In accordance with the criteria mentioned above, we discuss the laws of thermodynamics for three models of rotating regular black holes: Rotating Hayward black holes, Kerr black-bounce solutions, and loop quantum gravity black holes. Our findings indicate that none of the three models satisfies the first law of thermodynamics. In particular, the first and third models fail to comply with the three laws of thermodynamics, while the second model satisfies only the second and third laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we attempt to rescue the laws of thermodynamics by modifying entropy or extending phase space. However, the two scenarios are not able to ensure the three laws of thermodynamics in the three models, which reveals an unusual property of rotating regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced entanglement between two massive microscopic particles in curved spacetime: I.The Schwarzschild background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experiment involving the entanglement of two massive particles through gravitational fields has been devised to discern the quantum attributes of gravity. In this paper, we present a scheme to extend this experiment's applicability to more generalized curved spacetimes, with the objective of validating universal quantum gravity within broader contexts. Specifically, we direct our attention towards the quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in astrophysical phenomena, such as particles traversing the interstellar medium. Notably, we ascertain that the gravitational field within curved spacetime can induce observable entanglement between particle pairs in both scenarios, even when dealing with particles significantly smaller than mesoscopic masses. Furthermore, we obtain the characteristic spectra of QGEM across diverse scenarios, shedding light on potential future experimental examinations. This approach not only establishes a more pronounced and extensive manifestation of the quantum influences of gravity compared to the original scheme but also opens avenues for prospective astronomical experiments. These experiments, aligned with our postulates, hold immense advantages and implications for the detection of quantum gravity and can be envisioned for future design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work, we have explored quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in curved spacetime, observing entanglement formation between particles moving along geodesics in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that long interaction time induces entanglement, even for particles with microscopic mass, addressing decoherence concerns. In this work, we build upon our previous work by extending our investigation to a time-dependent spacetime. Specifically, we explore the entanglement induced by the mutual gravitation of massive particles in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) universe. Through calculations of the phase variation and the QGEM spectrum, our proposed scheme offers a potential method for observing the formation of entanglement caused by the quantum gravity of massive particles as they propagate in the FLRW universe. Consequently, our research provides fresh insights into the field of entanglement in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mixed scalarization of charged black holes: from spontaneous to non-linear scalarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalarized black holes (BH) have been shown to form dynamically in extended-scalar-tensor theories, either through spontaneous scalarization -- when the BH is unstable against linear perturbations -- or through a non-linear scalarization. In the latter, linearly stable BHs can ignite scalarization when sufficiently perturbed. These phenomena are, however, not incompatible and mixed scalarization is also possible. We explore two aspects of the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar model: solutions containing, simultaneously, linear (\textit{aka} standard) and non-linear scalarization; and the effects of having one of the coupling constants with an 'opposite sign' to the one leading to scalarization. Both points are addressed by constructing and examining the mixed scalarization's domain of existence. An overall dominance of the spontaneous scalarization over the non-linear scalarization is observed. Thermodynamically, an entropical preference for mixed over the standard scalarization (spontaneous or non-linear) exists. In the presence of counter scalarization, a quench of the scalarization occurs, mimicking the effect of a scalar particle's mass/positive self-interaction term.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum black holes (BHs), thought of as an excited multilevel system, can be effectively modelled by replacing an event horizon with a partially reflective membrane. This emergent feature affects their interaction with hosting environments, with the most pronounced effects happening for environments of particles with mass~$m_{\rm p}\lesssim (10 M_{\odot}/M)\,10^{-11}\mathrm{\,eV/c^2}$, with~$M$ the BH mass. We show that ultra-light bosons -- a viable dark matter candidate -- can be used to probe the quantum nature of BHs. We derive analytical expressions for the accretion rate and dynamical friction acting on exotic compact objects moving through an ultra-light scalar field, which we then use to estimate the orbital de-phasing in the inspiralling of different Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna (LISA) binaries. Our results indicate that LISA may be able to discriminate quantum from classical BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been pointed out that one can construct invertible conformal transformations with a parity-violating conformal factor, which can be employed to generate a novel class of parity-violating ghost-free metric theories from general relativity. We obtain exact solutions for rotating black holes in such theories by performing the conformal transformation on the Kerr solution in general relativity, which we dub conformal Kerr solutions. We explore the geodesic motion of a test particle in the conformal Kerr spacetime. While null geodesics remain the same as those in the Kerr spacetime, timelike geodesics exhibit interesting differences due to an effective external force caused by the parity-violating conformal factor.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis Effects on the Gravitational Waves Background: Interpreting the NANOGrav Measurements and JWST Constraints on Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the leptogenesis mechanisms, which are associated with B-L symmetry breaking mechanism has notable effects on the production of gravitational waves. These gravitational waves align well with the recent observations of a stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav and pulsar-timing arrays (PTAs). For these gravitational waves to match the recent measurements, the critical value of the B-L breaking should be around the GUT scale. Moreover, we consider the generation of primordial gravitational waves from binary systems of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) which could be predicted by the recent detection of gravitational waves. PBHs with specific masses can be responsible for massive galaxy formation observed at high redshifts reported by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We contemplate the potential for a shared source between the NANOGrav and JWST observations, namely primordial black holes. These black holes could serve as seeds of rapid galaxy formation, offering an explanation for the galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries and LSM-type constraints on a tensor product Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the exact non-invertible Kramers-Wannier symmetry of 1+1d lattice models on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits. This symmetry is associated with a topological defect and a conserved operator, and the latter can be presented as a matrix product operator. Importantly, unlike its continuum counterpart, the symmetry algebra involves lattice translations. Consequently, it is not described by a fusion category. In the presence of this defect, the symmetry algebra involving parity/time-reversal is realized projectively, which is reminiscent of an anomaly. Different Hamiltonians with the same lattice non-invertible symmetry can flow in their continuum limits to infinitely many different fusion categories (with different Frobenius-Schur indicators), including, as a special case, the Ising CFT. The non-invertible symmetry leads to a constraint similar to that of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis, implying that the system cannot have a unique gapped ground state. It is either in a gapless phase or in a gapped phase with three (or a multiple of three) ground states, associated with the spontaneous breaking of the lattice non-invertible symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Considering accretion onto a charged dilaton black hole, the fundamental equations governing accretion, general analytic expressions for critical points, critical velocity, critical speed of sound, and ultimately the mass accretion rate are obtained. A new constraint on the dilation parameter coming from string theory is found and the case for polytropic gas is delved into a detailed discussion. It is found that the dialtion and the adiabatic index of accreted material have deep effects on the accretion process.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>

Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>An intriguing connection between the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon and 2+p spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish a close connection between the Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon and a p=2+3 spin-glass model with sextic confinement potential. This is made possible by the unconventional power-counting induced by the effective kinetics provided by the disorder coupling in the large N -limit. Because of the absence of epsilon expansion, our approach is more attractive than the previous one and may probably play a relevant role in the signal detection issue in nearly continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>The simplest model of a scalarized black hole in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalarized black holes in the Einstein-minimally coupled scalar theory with a negative potential $V(\phi)=-\alpha^2\phi^6$. The tachyonic instability is absent from analyzing the linearized scalar equation, which could not allow for spontaneous scalarization. However, we obtain the black hole solutions with scalar hair by solving three full equations because this scalar potential violates the weak energy condition. This shows clearly that scalarized black holes can be obtained without introducing a non-minimal scalar coupling term. We perform the stability analysis for scalarized black holes by adopting radial perturbations, implying that all scalarized black holes belonging to a single branch are unstable.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of $\Lambda$CDM best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>
