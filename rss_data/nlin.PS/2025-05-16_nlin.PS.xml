      <title>Active waves from non-reciprocity and cytoplasmic exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation in active biological matter typically arises from the feedback between chemical concentration fields and mechanical stresses. The actomyosin cortex of cells is an archetypal example of an active thin film that displays such patterns. Here, we show how pulsatory patterns emerge in a minimal model of the actomyosin cortex with a single stress-regulating chemical species that exchanges material with the cytoplasm via a linear turnover reaction. Deriving a low-dimensional amplitude-phase model, valid for a one-dimensional periodic domain and a spherical surface, we show that nonlinear waves arise from a secondary parity-breaking bifurcation that originates from the nonreciprocal interaction between spatial modes of the concentration field. Numerical analysis confirms these analytical predictions, and also reveals analogous pulsatory patterns on impermeable domains. Our study provides a generic route to the emergence of nonreciprocity-driven pulsatory patterns that can be controlled by both the strength of activity and the turnover rate.</description>

      <title>Connection Between the Exact Moving Solutions of the Negative Korteweg-de Vries (nKdV) Equation and the Negative Modified Korteweg-de Vries (nmKdV) Equation and the Static Solutions of 1+1 Dimensional $\phi^4$ Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negative order KdV (nKdV) and the modified KdV (nmKdV) equations have two different formulations based on different hierarchy operators. Both equations can be written in terms of a nonlinear differential equation for a field $u(x,t)$ which we call the ``Lou form" of the equation. We find that for moving solutions of the nKdV equation and the nmKdV equation written in the ``Lou form" with $u(x,t) \rightarrow u (x-ct)= u(\xi) $, the equation for $u(\xi)$ can be mapped to the equation for the static solutions of the 1+1 dimensional $\phi^4$ field theory. Using this mapping we obtain a large number of solutions of the nKdV and the nmKdV equation, most of which are new. We also show that the nKdV equation can be derived from an Action Principle for both of its formulations. Furthermore, for both forms of the nmKdV equations as well as for both focusing and defocusing cases, we show that with a suitable ansatz one can decouple the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the nmKdV field $u(x,t)$ and obtain novel solutions in all the cases. We also obtain novel rational solutions of both the nKdV and the nmKdV equations.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring Fermi surface nesting instabilities in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Master stability for traveling waves on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for determining effectively the spectrum and stability of traveling waves on networks with symmetries, such as rings and lattices, by computing master stability curves (MSCs). Unlike traditional methods, MSCs are independent of system size and can be readily used to assess wave destabilization and multi-stability in small and large networks.</description>
