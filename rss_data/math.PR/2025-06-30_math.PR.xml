      <title>Some notes on Lamperti's recurrence of stochastic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study provides another look on Lamperti's theorem on recurrence or transience of stochastic sequences. We establish connection between Lamperti's theorem and the recent result by the author [V. M. Abramov, A new criterion for recurrence of Markov chains with infinitely countable set of states. \emph{Theor. Probab. Math. Stat.} \textbf{112} (2025), 1--15].</description>

      <title>Norm-dependent Lamperti-type MAP representations of stable processes and Brownian motions in the orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start by remarking a one-to-one correspondence between self-similar Markov processes (ssMps) on a Banach space and Markov additive processes (MAPs) that is analogous to the well-known one between positive ssMps and L\'evy processes through the renowned Lamperti-transform, with the main difference that ours is norm-dependent. We then consider multidimensional self-similar Markov processes obtained by killing or by reflecting a stable process or Brownian motion in the orthant and we then fully describe the MAPs associated to them using the $L_1$-norm. Namely, we describe the MAP underlying the ssMp obtained by killing a $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-stable process when it leaves the orthant and the one obtained by reflecting it back in the orthant continuously (or by a jump); finally, we also describe the MAP underlying $d$-dimensional Brownian motion reflected in the orthant. The first three of the aforementioned examples are pure-jump, and the last is a diffusion, so their characterization is given through their L\'evy system, generator and/or through the modulated SDE that defines them, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sharp mean-field estimates for the repulsive log gas in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp estimates for the mean-field limit of weakly interacting diffusions with repulsive logarithmic interaction in arbitrary dimension. More precisely, we show that the associated partition function is uniformly bounded in the number of particles $N$ for an arbitrary bounded base measure. Combined with the modulated free energy method, this amounts to a logarithmic improvement in $N$ of the current best available closeness estimates in the literature. Our arguments are inspired by and borrow ideas from Nelson's classical construction of the $\varphi^4_2$ Euclidean quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation theory from a Lagrangian viewpoint and the Schr\"odinger problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the Schr\"odinger problem for interacting particle systems in the hydrodynamical regime thus extending the standard setting of independent particles. This involves the large deviations rate function for the empirical measure which is in fact a richer observable than the hydrodynamic observables density and current. In the case in which the constraints are the initial and final density, we characterize the optimal measure for the Schr\"odinger problem. We also introduce versions of the Schr\"odinger problem in which the constraints are related to the current and analyze the corresponding optimal measures.</description>

      <title>Pinsker's inequality for adapted total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinsker's classical inequality asserts that the total variation $TV(\mu, \nu)$ between two probability measures is bounded by $\sqrt{ 2H(\mu|\nu)}$ where $H$ denotes the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). Considering the discrete metric, $TV$ can be seen as a Wasserstein distance and as such possesses an adapted variant $ATV$. Adapted Wasserstein distances have distinct advantages over their classical counterparts when $\mu, \nu$ are the laws of stochastic processes $(X_k)_{k=1}^n, (Y_k)_{k=1}^n$ and exhibit numerous applications from stochastic control to machine learning. In this note we observe that the adapted total variation distance $ATV$ satisfies the Pinsker-type inequality $$ ATV(\mu, \nu)\leq \sqrt{n} \sqrt{2 H(\mu|\nu)}.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to transform a continuous Markov semimartingale to a semimartingale. As a result, the no-arbitrage principle guarantees the differentiability of asset prices with respect to the underlying noise, if the asset prices are continuous and the underlying noise is a continuous Markov semimartingale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to extend the Sample-Path Large Deviation Principle for the urn model of Hill, Lane and Sudderth to the case in which the increment of the urn is not a binary variable. In particular, we sketch how to modify the Theorem 1 given in [Stochastic Processes and their Applications 127 (2017) 3372-3411] to include also urn processes with increments taking more than two values.</description>

      <title>Coverage of the unit cube by dynamic Boolean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by peer-to-peer telecommunication, we study a dynamic Boolean model. We define a Poisson number of random lines through the $(d-1)$-dimensional base of a $d$-dimensional unit cube and dilate them to define cylinders. Letting $\rho$ be the expected number of cylinders, the random variable of interest is the coverage radius $R_\rho$, which is the cylinder radius required to cover the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that $R_\rho^{d-1}$ is of the order $\log \rho / \rho$ with high probability as $\rho$ tends to infinity.
  We also consider alternative dynamics resulting in generalized cylinders that are generated by dilating the trajectories of stochastic processes, in particular Brownian motions. This leads to a coverage radius of the same order.</description>

      <title>CLT for martingales-III: discontinuous compensators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new weak convergence theorem for martingales, under gentler conditions than the usual convergence in probability of the sequence of associated quadratic variations. Its proof requires the combined use of Skorohod's $\cJ_1$-topology and $\cM_1$-topology on the space of c\`adl\`ag trajectories. The emphasis is on those instances where the sequence of martingales or its limit is a mixture of stochastic processes with discontinuities. Alternative conditions are set forth in the special cases of arrays of discrete time martingale differences and martingale transforms. Examples of applications are provided, notably when the limiting process is a Brownian subordinator.</description>

      <title>An iterated random function with Lipschitz number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the set of functions $f_{\theta}(x)=|\theta -x|$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Define a Markov process that starts with a point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and continues with $x_{k+1}=f_{\theta_{k+1}}(x_{k})$ with each $\theta _{k+1}$ picked from a fixed bounded distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^+$. We prove the conjecture of G. Letac that if $\mu$ is not supported on a lattice, then this process has a unique stationary distribution $\pi_{\mu}$ and any distribution converges under iteration to $\pi_{\mu}$ (in the weak-$^*$ topology). We also give a bound on the rate of convergence in the special case that $\mu$ is supported on a two-point set. We hope that the techniques will be useful for the study of other Markov processes where the transition functions have Lipschitz number one.</description>

      <title>Estimating causal distances with non-causal ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein ($AW$) distance refines the classical Wasserstein ($W$) distance by incorporating the temporal structure of stochastic processes. This makes the $AW$-distance well-suited as a robust distance for many dynamic stochastic optimization problems where the classical $W$-distance fails. However, estimating the $AW$-distance is a notably challenging task, compared to the classical $W$-distance. In the present work, we build a sharp estimate for the $AW$-distance in terms of the $W$-distance, for smooth measures. This reduces estimating the $AW$-distance to estimating the $W$-distance, where many well-established classical results can be leveraged. As an application, we prove a fast convergence rate of the kernel-based empirical estimator under the $AW$-distance, which approaches the Monte-Carlo rate ($n^{-1/2}$) in the regime of highly regular densities. These results are accomplished by deriving a sharp bi-Lipschitz estimate of the adapted total variation distance by the classical total variation distance.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors in the complete graph $K_n$, is a central object in combinatorial optimization, with applications ranging from max-cut problems to correlation analysis. Building on a probabilistic interpretation via agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables, we derive an explicit closed-form formula for enumerating the vertices of the related polytope $1$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$. Our approach is based on a natural binary encoding of cut vectors and introduces the alternating cycle function, a map that generates integer sequences with palindromic and recursive structure. This encoding directly captures the vertex structure and reveals that the scaled encoded vertices, perhaps unexpectedly, exhibit an almost-linear behaviour. This work provides the first explicit vertex enumeration formula for this classical polytope family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a representation of the heat flow with Wentzell boundary conditions on smooth domains as gradient descent dynamics for the entropy in a suitably extended Otto manifold of probability measures with additional boundary parts. Yet it is shown that for weak boundary diffusion, the associated Fokker-Planck dynamics cannot be recovered from any entropy-driven metric JKO-Wasserstein scheme, at least if the underlying point metric satisfies certain natural regularity assumptions. This discrepancy is illustrated in competing large-deviation heuristics in the Sanov and Schilder regimes.</description>

      <title>Average-case complexity in statistical inference: A puzzle-driven research seminar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes describe our experience with running a student seminar on average-case complexity in statistical inference using the jigsaw learning format at ETH Zurich in Fall of 2024. The jigsaw learning technique is an active learning technique where students work in groups on independent parts of the task and then reassemble the groups to combine all the parts together. We implemented this technique for the proofs of various recent research developments, combined with a presentation by one of the students in the beginning of the session. We describe our experience and thoughts on such a format applied in a student research seminar: including, but not limited to, higher engagement, more accessible talks by the students, and increased student participation in discussions. In the Appendix, we include all the exercises sheets for the topic, which may be of independent interest for courses on statistical-to-computational gaps and average-case complexity.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time Bounds for the Gibbs Sampler under Isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish bounds on the conductance for the systematic-scan and random-scan Gibbs samplers when the target distribution satisfies a Poincare or log-Sobolev inequality and possesses sufficiently regular conditional distributions. These bounds lead to mixing time guarantees that extend beyond the log-concave setting, offering new insights into the convergence behavior of Gibbs sampling in broader regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our results remain valid for log-Lipschitz and log-smooth target distributions. Our approach relies on novel three-set isoperimetric inequalities and a sequential coupling argument for the Gibbs sampler.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Space-time White Noise and Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is an introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), using the random field approach pioneered by J.B. Walsh (1986). It consists of two blocks: the core matter (Chapters 1 to 6) and the appendices (A to C). Chapter 1 introduces the subject, with a discussion of isonormal Gaussian processes, space-time white noise, and motivating examples of SPDEs. Chapter 2 presents a theory of stochastic integration with respect to space-time white noise. Chapter 3 deals with SPDEs with additive noise. In Chapter 4, we study a general class of SPDEs, in which additive and multiplicative nonlinearities appear. Chapter 5 discusses asymptotic properties of the solution to the stochastic heat equation such as existence of invariant and reversible measures, convergence in law to the invariant distribution, mixing and irreducibility. In Chapter 6, we prove a theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions in the weak sense. Then we present a selection of important topics in the theory of SPDEs: the Markov field property, asymptotic bounds on moments of solutions that are useful for studying long-time behavior of the solutions, a comparison theorem for the stochastic heat equation, an introduction to potential theory for SPDEs, and a study of SPDEs with rough initial conditions.
  Appendix A summarises the main results from the theory of stochastic processes and stochastic analysis that are used throughout the book. Appendix B is devoted to a systematic presentation of properties of fundamental solutions and Green's functions associated to the classical linear differential operators (heat, fractional heat and wave operators). Appendix C is a toolbox section. Each chapter is followed by a "Notes" section, which gives historically important references, original sources and points towards other related important contributions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Processes on $p$-Wasserstein Space over Banach Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study diffusion processes on the p-Wasserstein space $\mathscr P_p$ for $p\in [1,\infty)$ over a separable, reflexive Banach space $X$, we present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms in $L^2(\mathscr P_p,\Lambda)$ for a reference probability $\Lambda$ on $\mathscr P_p$. It is formulated in terms of an upper bound condition with the uniform norm of the intrinsic derivative. We find a versatile class of quasi-regular local Dirichlet forms on $\mathscr P_p$ by using images of Dirichlet forms on the tangent space $L^p(X\to X,\mu_0)$ at a reference point $\mu_0\in\mathscr P_p$. The Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type Dirichlet form and process on $\mathscr P_2$ are an important example in this class. We derive an $L^2$-estimate for the corresponding heat kernel and an integration by parts formula for the invariant measure.</description>

      <title>Markov Processes and Stochastic Extrinsic Derivative Flows on the Space of Absolutely Continuous Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be the class of finite (resp. probability) measures absolutely continuous with respect to a $\sigma$-finite Radon measure on a Polish space. We present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms on $E$ in terms of upper bound conditions given by the uniform $(L^1+L^\infty)$-norm of the extrinsic derivative. As applications, we construct a class of general type Markov processes on $E$ via quasi-regular Dirichlet forms containing the diffusion, jump and killing terms. Moreover, stochastic extrinsic derivative flows on $E$ are studied by using quasi-regular Dirichlet forms, which in particular provide martingale solutions to SDEs on these two spaces, with drifts given by the extrinsic derivative of entropy functionals.</description>

      <title>Stochastic motions of the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas, I: One-$\delta$ motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series devoted to constructing stochastic motions for the two-dimensional $N$-body delta-Bose gas for all integers $N\geq 3$ and establishing the associated Feynman-Kac-type formulas; see [12,13,14] for the remaining of the series. The main results of this paper establish the foundation by studying the stochastic one-$\delta$ motions, which relate to the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas by turning off all but one delta function, and we prove the central distributional properties and the SDEs. The proofs extend the method in [11] for the stochastic relative motions and develop and use analytical formulas of the probability distributions of the stochastic one-$\delta$ motions.</description>

      <title>PC Adjusted Testing for Low Dimensional Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-dimensional Principal Component (PC) adjustments on inferring the effects of variables on outcomes, with a focus on applications in genetic association studies where PC adjustment is commonly used to account for population stratification. We consider high-dimensional linear regression in the regime where the number of covariates grows proportionally to the number of samples. In this setting, we provide an asymptotically precise understanding of when PC adjustments yield valid tests with controlled Type I error rates. Our results demonstrate that, under both fixed and diverging signal strengths, PC regression often fails to control the Type I error at the desired nominal level. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Type I error inflation based on covariate distributions. These theoretical findings are further supported by a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-sided bell-shaped sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonnegative real function f is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth derivative of f changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... Similarly, a two-sided nonnegative sequence a(k) is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth iterated difference of a(k) changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... A characterisation of bell-shaped functions was given by Thomas Simon and the first named author, and recently a similar result for one-sided bell-shaped sequences was found by the authors. In the present article we give a complete description of two-sided bell-shaped sequences. Our main result proves that bell-shaped sequences are convolutions of P\'olya frequency sequences and what we call absolutely monotone-then-completely monotone sequences, and it provides an equivalent, and relatively easy to verify, condition in terms of holomorphic extensions of the generating function. We also prove that if f is a bell-shaped function, then f(k) is a bell-shaped sequence.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Adaptive inference with random ellipsoids through Conformal Conditional Linear Expectation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two new conformity scores for conformal prediction, in a general multivariate regression framework. The underlying score functions are based on a covariance analysis of the residuals and the input points. We give theoretical guarantees on the prediction sets, which consist in explicit ellipsoids. We study the asymptotic properties of the ellipsoids, and show that their volume is reduced compared to that of classic balls, under ellipticity assumptions. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of all our results on an in-depth numerical study, including heavy-tailed as well as non-elliptical distributions.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Theorems between Models of Mixed Choice (Revised)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the so-called powercone models of mixed non-deterministic and probabilistic choice proposed by Tix, Keimel, Plotkin, Mislove, Ouaknine, Worrell, Morgan, and McIver, to our own models of previsions. Under suitable topological assumptions, we show that they are isomorphic. We rely on Keimel's cone-theoretic variants of the classical Hahn-Banach separation theorems, using functional analytic methods, and on the Schr\"oder-Simpson Theorem. Lemma 3.4 in the original 2017 version, published at MSCS, had a wrong proof, and we prove a repaired, albeit slightly less general version here.</description>

      <title>Estimation of rates in population-age-dependent processes by means of test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop practical applications of the model for the highly technical measure-valued populations developed by the authors in \cite{FanEtal20}. We consider the problem of estimation of parameters in the general age and population-dependent model, in which the individual birth and death rates depend not only on the age of the individual but also on the whole population composition. We derive new estimators of the rates based on the use of test functions in the functional Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for populations with a large carrying capacity. We consider the rates to be simple functions, that take finitely many values both in age $x$ and measure $A$, which leads to systems of linear equations. The proposed method of using test functions for estimation is a radically new approach which can be applied to a wide range of models of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the estimation of a rank-one tensor signal when only a portion $\varepsilon$ of its noisy observation is available. We show that the study of this problem can be reduced to that of a random matrix model whose spectral analysis gives access to the reconstruction performance. These results shed light on and specify the loss of performance induced by an artificial reduction of the memory cost of a tensor via the deletion of a random part of its entries.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of Mean Field Games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>
