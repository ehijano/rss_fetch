      <title>Fast Queries of Fibered Barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fibered barcode $\mathcal{F}(M)$ of a bipersistence module $M$ is the map sending each non-negatively sloped affine line $\ell \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ to the barcode of the restriction of $M$ along $\ell$. The simplicity, computability, and stability of $\mathcal{F}(M)$ make it a natural choice of invariant for data analysis applications. In an earlier preprint [arXiv:1512.00180], we introduced a framework for real-time interactive visualization of $\mathcal{F}(M)$, which allows the user to select a single line $\ell$ via a GUI and then plots the associated barcode. This visualization is a key feature of our software RIVET for the visualization and analysis of bipersistent homology. Such interactive visualization requires a framework for efficient queries of $\mathcal{F}(M)$, i.e., for quickly obtaining the barcode along a given line $\ell$. To enable such queries, we introduced a novel data structure based on planar line arrangements, called an augmented arrangement. The aim of the present paper is to give an updated and improved exposition of the parts of our preprint [arXiv:1512.00180] concerning the mathematics of the augmented arrangement and its computation. Notably, by taking the input to be a minimal presentation rather than a chain complex, we are able to substantially simplify our main algorithm and its complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck--Teichm\"uller Symmetries of Cyclic Operads and Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the profinite Grothendieck--Teichm\"uller group $\widehat{\mathsf{GT}}$ as the group of automorphisms of the profinite completion of the cyclic operad of parenthesised ribbon braids. This operad admits a metric envelope identified with the category of framed, oriented tangles, thereby providing an operadic model for profinite tangles and their arithmetic symmetries. As applications, we show that $\widehat{\mathsf{GT}}$ acts naturally on tangles and provide an alternative proof of the formality of the cyclic framed little disks operad.</description>

      <title>Characterizing model structures on finite posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer systems on finite posets have recently been gaining traction as a key ingredient in equivariant homotopy theory. Additionally, they also naturally occur in the data of a model structure. We give a complete characterization of all model category structures on a finite lattice, using transfer systems as our main tool, resulting in new connections between abstract homotopy theory and equivariant methods.</description>

      <title>Monadic resolutions for generalized spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the work of Bousfield and Kan on monadic resolutions of spaces to $\infty$-topoi, with applications to genuine $G$-equivariant spaces ($G$ a finite group) and motivic spaces over a perfect field. In particular, we give a proof of the principal fibration lemma in this context. We apply the principal fibration lemma to prove convergence of several kinds of monadic resolutions in unstable equivariant and motivic homotopy theory. For example, we show that, over an algebraically closed field, the unstable Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (i.e., the monadic resolution corresponding to the algebraic cobordism spectrum $\mathrm{MGL}$) converges for all nilpotent, connected, $2$-effective motivic spaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of 0-dimensional persistent homology in enriched and sparsified point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give bounds for dimension 0 persistent homology and codimension 1 homology of Vietoris--Rips, alpha, and cubical complex filtrations from finite sets related by enrichment (adding new elements), sparsification (removing elements), and aligning to a grid (uniformly discretizing elements). For enrichment we use barycentric subdivision, for sparsification we use an iterative minimum separating distance procedure, and for aligning to a grid we take the quotient when dividing each coordinate value by a fixed step size. We are motivated by applications to biology, in which the state of a species is inferred through its ``hypervolume'', a high-dimensional space with environmental variables as dimensions. The hypervolume has geometry (volume, convexity) and topology (connectedness, homology), which are known to be related to the current and potentially future status of the species. We offer an approach with topological guarantees that is complementary to modern methods for computing the hypervolume, giving precise bounds between persistence diagrams of Vietoris--Rips and alpha complexes, and a duality identity for cubical complexes. Implementation of our methods, called TopoAware, is made available in C++, Python, and R, building upon the GUDHI library.</description>

      <title>The Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence for G-proper manifolds and depth-1 pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis revolves around the Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence: in particular adapted to the context of (G, F)-spaces, i.e. proper G-spaces with isotropy groups belonging to a family F of subgroups of G, and to that of manifolds with non-isolated singularities. In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$.</description>

      <title>On the tensor-triangular geometry of isotropic motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor-triangular geometry of the categories of isotropic Tate motives, isotropic Artin motives and isotropic Artin--Tate motives. In particular, we study the categories $DTM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$, $DAM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $DATM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ where $k$ is a flexible field and we fix $\mathbb{F}_2$-coefficients. In this case, we prove their Balmer spectra are singletons. The proof of this relies on the fact that the categories in question are generated by objects whose morphisms are `nilpotent enough.' Furthermore, we investigate their homological spectra, and verify Balmer's Nerves of Steel conjecture in these cases by showing these spaces are also singletons, and we give an explicit description of the homological primes. We also investigate stratification, and we conclude by studying generation properties of these categories -- the latter results we see also apply to global (i.e. non-isotropic) motives.</description>

      <title>Topologically Invariant Permutation Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of $k$ nontrivial partitions of a positive integer $d$ satisfying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and if $k$ is greater than one plus the minimum length among the partitions in $\mathcal{D}$, then $\mathcal{D}$ is realizable as the branch data of a rational map $f \colon S^2 \to S^2$. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Zheng [\textit{Topology Appl.} \textbf{153} (2006), no.~12, 2124--2134].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09350v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homology of the free and the based loop space of a compact globally symmetric space can be studied through explicit cycles. We use cycles constructed by Bott and Samelson and by Ziller to study the string topology coproduct and the Chas-Sullivan product on compact symmetric spaces. We show that the Chas-Sullivan product for compact symmetric spaces is highly non-trivial for any rank and we prove that there are many non-nilpotent classes whose powers correspond to the iteration of closed geodesics. Moreover, we show that the based string topology coproduct is trivial for compact symmetric spaces of higher rank and we study the implications of this result for the string topology coproduct on the free loop space.</description>

Abstract: We provide proofs of two theorems stated by Massey in 1961, concerning the obstructions to finding complex structures on real vector bundles. In addition, we determine the second obstruction to a complex structure on a rank six orientable real vector bundle. The obstructions are fractional parts of integral Stiefel-Whitney classes, and a fourth of an appropriate combination of Pontryagin, Chern, and Euler classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a contramodule over a cocommutative coalgebra in a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, and prove a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categorical version of Positselski's comodule-contramodule correspondence when the coalgebra is coidempotent. This gives a new perspective on, and a new proof of local duality -- in the sense of Hovey--Palmieri--Strickland and Dwyer--Greenlees -- whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is stable and compactly generated. We further consider an analog of Positselski's definition of contramodules over topological rings in the $\infty$-categorical setting, and show that the two perspectives on contramodules are equivalent. As examples we describe the categories of $K(n)$-local spectra, $T(n)$-local spectra and the derived complete category of a ring $R$, as categories of contramodules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each configuration of rational points on the affine line, we define an operation on the group of unstable A1 motivic homotopy classes of endomorphisms of the projective line. We also derive an algebraic formula for the image of such an operation under Cazanave and Morel's unstable degree map, which is valued in an extension of the Grothendieck--Witt group. In contrast to the topological setting, these operations depend on the choice of configuration of points via a discriminant. We prove this by first showing a local-to-global formula for the global unstable degree as a modified sum of local terms. We then use an anabelian argument to generalize from the case of local degrees of a global rational function to the case of an arbitrary collection of endomorphisms of the projective line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To a bicomplex one can associate two natural filtrations, the column and row filtrations, and then two associated spectral sequences. This can be generalized to $N$-multicomplexes. We present a family of model category structures on the category of $N$-multicomplexes where the weak equivalences are the morphisms inducing a quasi-isomorphism at a fixed page $r$ of the first spectral sequence and at a fixed page $s$ of the second spectral sequence. Such weak equivalences arise naturally in complex geometry. In particular, the model structures presented here establish a basis for studying homotopy types of almost and generalized complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a group retraction $r: G \rightarrow H $, we construct a finite topological space $ X_r $ of height 1, together with a topological retraction $\overline{r}: X_r \rightarrow X_r $, such that the group of automorphisms $ \mathrm{Aut}(X_r) $ (or the group of self-homotopy equivalences $ \mathcal{E}(X_r) $) of $X_r$ is isomorphic to $ G $, and $ \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ (or $\mathcal{E}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $) is isomorphic to $ H$. Moreover, there is a natural map $\overline{r}' : \mathrm{Aut}(X_r) \rightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(\overline{r}(X_r)) $ that coincides with the original group retraction $ r $. As a direct consequence of this construction, we show that height 1 is the minimal height required to realize any finite group as the group of automorphisms (or the group of self-homotopy equivalences) of a finite topological space, except in the case where $ G $ is a symmetric group. In that unique case, the group can be realized by a finite topological space of height 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic theory of monomial ideals and multigraded modules is initiated over real-exponent polynomial rings and, more generally, monoid algebras for real polyhedral cones. The main results include the generalization of Nakayama's lemma; complete theories of minimal and dense primary, secondary, and irreducible decomposition, including associated and attached faces; socles and tops; minimality and density for downset hulls, upset covers, and fringe presentations; Matlis duality; and geometric analysis of staircases. Modules that are semialgebraic or piecewise-linear (PL) have the relevant property preserved by functorial constructions as well as by minimal primary and secondary decompositions. And when the modules in question are subquotients of the group itself, such as monomial ideals and quotients modulo them, minimal primary and secondary decompositions are canonical, as are irreducible decompositions up to the new real-exponent notion of density.</description>

      <title>Regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties with cohomology rings generated in degree two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03762v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the flag variety determined by a square matrix $S$ with distinct eigenvalues and a Hessenberg function $h$. The cohomology ring $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is independent of the choice of $S$ and is not explicitly described except for a few cases. In this paper, we characterize the Hessenberg function $h$ such that $H^*(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is generated in degree two as a ring. It turns out that such $h$ is what is called a (double) lollipop.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>

Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold M into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise. We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds. We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers. We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties. Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities. Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting. We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>
