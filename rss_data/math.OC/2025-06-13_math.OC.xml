      <title>Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz exponent via sqaure parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one of the most common reparameterization techniques, the square transformation. Assuming the original objective function is the sum of a smooth function and a polyhedral function, we study the variational properties of the objective function after reparameterization. In particular, we first study the minimal norm of the subdifferential of the reparameterized objective function. Second, we compute the second subderivative of the reparameterized objective function on a linear subspace, which allows for fully characterizing the subclass of stationary points of the reparameterized objective function that correspond to stationary points of the original objective function. Finally, utilizing the representation of the minimal norm of the subdifferential, we show that the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) exponent of the reparameterized function can be deduced from that of the original function.</description>

      <title>Strategic Adoption of 3D Printing in Multi-Product Supply Chains: Cost and Capacity Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Additive Manufacturing (or 3D printing) into decentralized supply chains, focusing on the strategic decisions manufacturers and retailers make when facing capacity constraints. Using a Stackelberg game framework, we analyze how AM impacts traditional wholesale pricing across two scenarios. First, a manufacturer producing two distinct products and second, a case involving multiple products, each affected by AM's capacity limitations. For the first scenario, we derive sufficient conditions to find the equilibrium under a generic demand distribution, and for a uniform distribution, we fully derive the equilibrium and identify the critical cost threshold below which AM adoption is preferable. For the second scenario, we determine the conditions for the equilibrium, offering insights into the feasibility of AM relative to traditional manufacturing. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to some literature, even when AM incurs higher per-unit costs than traditional methods, it remains viable for some supply chains. However, limited AM capacity, particularly under high demand, may restrict its adoption, highlighting capacity constraints as a pivotal factor in AM decision-making. This study extends current research by examining multi-product and capacity-driven scenarios, providing valuable guidance for supply chain managers weighing the benefits of traditional manufacturing against those of AM.</description>

      <title>Optimal Voltage Control Using Online Exponential Barrier Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper address the optimal voltage control problem of distribution systems with high penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources, under inaccurate model information. We propose the online exponential barrier method that explicitly leverages the online feedback from grids to enhance the robustness to model inaccuracy and incorporates the voltage constraints to maintain the safety requirements. We provide analytical results on the optimal barrier parameter selection and sufficient conditions for the safety guarantee of converged voltages. We also establish theoretical results on the exponential convergence rate with proper step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 56-bus radial network, where we significantly improve the robustness against model inaccuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Less-Than-Truckload Transportation Planning in Hyperconnected Hub Networks with Multi-Carrier Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Less-than-truckload (LTL) shipment is vital in modern freight transportation yet is in dire need of more efficient usage of resources, higher service responsiveness and velocity, lower overall shipping cost across all parties, and better quality of life for the drivers. The industry is currently highly fragmented, with numerous small to medium-sized LTL carriers typically operating within dedicated regions or corridors, mostly disconnected from each other. This paper investigates the large-scale interconnection of LTL carriers enabling each to leverage multi-carrier networks for cross-region services exploiting their mutual logistic hubs, in line with Physical Internet principles. In such a network, efficient open cooperation strategies are critical for optimizing multiparty relay shipment consolidation and delivery, transport and logistic operations and orchestration, and enabling inter-hub driver short hauls. To dynamically plan relay truck transportation of involved carriers across hyperconnected hub networks, we develop an optimization-based model to build loads, coordinate shipments, and synchronize driver deliveries. We report a simulation-based experiment in a multiparty LTL network covering the eastern U.S. in three scenarios: 1) each carrier operates separately and serves its clients with end-to-end transportation, 2) each carrier operates separately and adopts relay transportation in its service region, and 3) all carriers operate jointly and serve clients in the multi-carrier hyperconnected relay network. By comparing these three scenarios, we evaluate the impact of relay transportation and carrier cooperations on cost savings, trip duration, and greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, this research advances operational efficiencies through an effective collaborative solution across the LTL industry and contributes to the pursuit of sustainable logistics networks.</description>

      <title>Green Scheduling with Time-of-Use Tariffs and Machine States: Optimizing Energy Cost via Branch-and-Bound and Bin Packing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a branch-and-bound algorithm, enhanced with bin packing strategies, for scheduling under variable energy pricing and power-saving states. The proposed algorithm addresses the 1,TOU|states|TEC problem, which involves scheduling jobs to minimize total energy cost (TEC) while considering time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices and different machine states (e.g., processing, idle, off). Key innovations include instance pre-processing for rapid lower bound calculations, a novel branching scheme combined with initializations, a block-finding primal heuristic, and a tighter lower bound for jobs with non-coprime processing times. These enhancements result in an efficient algorithm capable of solving benchmark instances with real energy prices with 200 jobs more than 100 times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Dirichlet Boundary Condition with a Bounded Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w(0,x_2,t)=u(x_2,t)$, $x_1\in\mathbb R_+=(0,+\infty)$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u$ is a control belonging to a special subset of $L^\infty(\mathbb R\times (0,T))\cap L^2(\mathbb R\times (0,T))$. It is proved that each initial state belonging to $L^2(\mathbb R_+\times\mathbb R)$ is approximately controllable to an arbitrary end state belonging to $L^2(\mathbb R_+\times\mathbb R)$ by applying these controls. A numerical algorithm of solving the approximate controllability problem for this system is given. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Robust output stability and input-to-output stability based on output dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaSalle techniques to ensure the convergence of a given output usually fail at guaranteeing uniform convergence time, which induces robustness issues. Recent works have provided extra conditions under which a Lyapunov function that dissipates in terms of only the output guarantees this uniformity. In this paper, we extend these results to systems with inputs in order to establish either robust stability or input-to-output stability. In addition, we show that a recent relaxation of Barb__lat's lemma is also applicable to systems with inputs. The significance of the proposed results is demonstrated in the context of a recent adaptive control scheme.</description>

      <title>Controllability and Stabilization of a Wave-Heat Cascade System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a wave-reaction-diffusion PDE cascade system with wave Neumann control, we first establish controllability properties in a suitable Hilbert space depending on the coupling cascade term. This is done by deriving an observability inequality for the dual problem by resorting to an Ingham-M{\"u}ntz inequality. Second, we design an explicit output feedback control strategy for the actual stabilization of the PDE cascade. The key property is that the underlying operator is a Riesz-spectral operator.</description>

      <title>Boundary control of heat-heat cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of feedback stabilization of a cascade of two heat equations that are coupled in the boundary conditions, the input being a boundary control for the first component of the cascade. Two distinct control input settings are studied: one being collocated with the coupling condition of the two heat equations, and the other being noncollocated. These two different configurations induce different controllability properties. The key idea developed in this paper is to carry out spectral reductions, not for each of the two components of the cascade separately, but instead, directly for the PDE cascade viewed as one single system. A detailed study of the eigenelements of the PDE cascade yields a complete characterization of the spectral mode controllability and allows us to derive an explicit state-feedback control strategy for the exponential stabilization of the plant. This approach is extended to a systematic output-feedback control strategy either with a distributed output operator or with a pointwise measurement done on the second heat equation of the PDE cascade. In both state-feedback and output-feedback scenarios, stabilization results are established in L^2 and H^1 norms. Finally, we show how the results developed in this paper for the two studied heat-heat cascades extend to their dual problems.</description>

      <title>Boundary output feedback stabilization of a cascade of N heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper solves the problem of output feedback stabilization for a cascade of N heat equations that are coupled at the boundary, the input being a scalar boundary control applied to the first heat equation of the cascade, and the scalar output being either a distributed or a pointwise in-domain measurement done on the last equation of the cascade. Two different configurations are studied in details. The first one consists of a cascade of N heat equations with totally disconnected spectra. The second one consists of a cascade of N identical heat equations, inducing eigenvalues of multiplicity N . In both cases, the problem is solved thanks to a spectral analysis and a study of the modal controllability and observability properties. The key point is that the generalized eigenvectors form a Riesz basis of the state space. The stabilization property is established in L^2 and H^1 norms.</description>

      <title>On a mean-field Pontryagin minimum principle for stochastic optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This papers outlines a novel extension of the classical Pontryagin minimum (maximum) principle to stochastic optimal control problems. Contrary to the well-known stochastic Pontryagin minimum principle involving forward-backward stochastic differential equations, the proposed formulation is deterministic and of mean-field type. The Hamiltonian structure of the proposed Pontryagin minimum principle is achieved via the introduction of an appropriate gauge variable. The gauge freedom can be used to decouple the forward and reverse time equations; hence simplifying the solution of the underlying boundary value problem. We also consider infinite horizon discounted cost optimal control problems. In this case, the mean-field formulation allows converting the computation of the desired optimal control law into solving a pair of forward mean-field ordinary differential equations. The proposed mean-field formulation of the Pontryagin minimum principle is tested numerically for a controlled inverted pendulum and a controlled Lorenz-63 system.</description>

      <title>A potential-theoretic approach to optimal stopping in a spectrally L\'evy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic solution method for optimal stopping problem of one-dimensional spectrally negative L\'evy processes. Our main tools are based on potential theory, particularly the Riesz decomposition and the maximum principle. This novel approach allows us to handle a broad class of reward functions. That is, we solve the problem in a general setup without relying on specific form of the reward function or on the fluctuation identities. We provide a step-by-step solution procedure, which is applicable to complex solution structures including multiple double-sided continuation regions.</description>

      <title>On the integrality Gap of Small Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems: A Polyhedral and Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integrality gap of the Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP) with respect to the linear relaxation given by the Asymmetric Subtour Elimination Problem (ASEP) for instances with $n$ nodes, where $n$ is small. In particular, we focus on the geometric properties and symmetries of the ASEP polytope ($P^{n}_{ASEP}$) and its vertices. The polytope's symmetries are exploited to design a heuristic pivoting algorithm to search vertices where the integrality gap is maximized. Furthermore, a general procedure for the extension of vertices from $P^{n}_{ASEP}$ to $P^{n + 1}_{ASEP}$ is defined. The generated vertices improve the known lower bounds of the integrality gap for $ 16 \leq n \leq 22$ and, provide small hard-to-solve ATSP instances.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Optimal Control Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes sensitivities of the solution of an optimal control problem (OCP) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state/control-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs and the objective function. This extends existing OCP sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the OCP solution with respect to state/control-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the OCP solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the QoI when the component function is perturbed. Applicability of the theoretical results is demonstrated on a trajectory optimization problem for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>Bregman proximal gradient method for linear optimization under entropic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for solving a linear optimization problem with entropic constraints -- a class of problems that arises in game theory and information theory. Our analysis distinguishes between the cases of active and inactive constraints, addressing each using a Bregman proximal gradient method with entropic Legendre functions, for which we establish an ergodic convergence rate of $O(1/n)$ in objective values. For a specific cost structure, our framework provides a theoretical justification for the well-known Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. In the active constraint setting, we include a bisection procedure to approximate the strictly positive Lagrange multiplier. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated through comparisons with standard optimization solvers on a representative example from game theory, including extensions to higher-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.</description>

      <title>A space-time interface-fitted method for moving-subdomain distributed control problems with energy regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a space-time interface-fitted approximation of a moving-interface optimal control problem with energy regularization. We reformulate the optimality conditions into a variational problem involving both the state and adjoint. This problem is shown to be equivalent to our optimal control problem. Based on fully unstructured, space-time interface-fitted meshes, we propose and analyze a Petrov-Galerkin approximation of the problem. An optimal error estimate with respect to a discrete norm is established under a specific regularity assumption on the state and adjoint. Several numerical results are presented to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>ASMOP: Additional sampling stochastic trust region method for multi-objective problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an unconstrained multi-criteria optimization problem with finite sum objective functions. The proposed algorithm belongs to a non-monotone trust-region framework where additional sampling approach is used to govern the sample size and the acceptance of a candidate point. Depending on the problem, the method can result in a mini-batch or an increasing sample size approach. Therefore, this work can be viewed as an extension of additional sampling trust region method for scalar finite sum function minimization presented in the literature. We show stochastic convergence of the proposed scheme for twice continuously-differentiable, but possibly non-convex objective functions, under assumptions standard for this framework. The experiments on logistic regression and least squares problems show the efficiency of the proposed scheme and its competitiveness with the relevant state-of-the-art methods for the considered problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Propagation with Guarantees in Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of propagating an uncertain distribution by a possibly non-linear function and quantifying the resulting uncertainty. We measure the uncertainty using the Wasserstein distance, and for a given input set of distributions close in the Wasserstein distance, we compute a set of distributions centered at a discrete distribution that is guaranteed to contain the pushforward of any distribution in the input set. Our approach is based on approximating a nominal distribution from the input set to a discrete support distribution for which the exact computation of the pushforward distribution is tractable, thus guaranteeing computational efficiency to our approach. Then, we rely on results from semi-discrete optimal transport and distributional robust optimization to show that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ the error introduced by our approach can be made smaller than $\epsilon$. Critically, in the context of dynamical systems, we show how our results allow one to efficiently approximate the distribution of a stochastic dynamical system with a discrete support distribution for a possibly infinite horizon while bounding the resulting approximation error. We empirically investigate the effectiveness of our framework on various benchmarks, including a 10-D non-linear system, showing the effectiveness of our approach in quantifying uncertainty in linear and non-linear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Design of A* based heuristic algorithm for efficient interdiction in multi-Layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study S-shaped utility maximisation with VaR constraint and unobservable drift coefficient. Using the Bayesian filter, the concavification principle, and the change of measure, we give a semi-closed integral representation for the dual value function and find a critical wealth level that determines if the constrained problem admits a unique optimal solution and Lagrange multiplier or is infeasible. We also propose three algorithms (Lagrange, simulation, deep neural network) to solve the problem and compare their performances with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for second-order systems with generalized proportional damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured reduced-order modeling is a central component in the computer-aided design of control systems in which cheap-to-evaluate low-dimensional models with physically meaningful internal structures are computed. In this work, we develop a new approach for the structured data-driven surrogate modeling of linear dynamical systems described by second-order time derivatives via balanced truncation model-order reduction. The proposed method is a data-driven reformulation of position-velocity balanced truncation for second-order systems and generalizes the quadrature-based balanced truncation for unstructured first-order systems to the second-order case. The computed surrogates encode a generalized proportional damping structure, and the damping coefficients are inferred solely from data by minimizing a least-squares error over the coefficients. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Diffusion prior as a direct regularization term for FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states, which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging. In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Neuromorphic Control Systems: A General Proposal and A Rhythmic Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic control is receiving growing attention due to the multifaceted advantages it brings over more classical control approaches, including: sparse and on-demand sensing, information transmission, and actuation; energy-efficient designs and realizations in neuromorphic hardware; event-based signal processing and control signal computation. However, a general control-theoretical formalization of what "neuromorphic control systems" are and how we can rigorously analyze, design, and control them is still largely missing. In this note, we suggest a possible path toward formalizing neuromorphic control systems. We apply the proposed framework to a rhythmic control case study and rigorously show how it has the potential to make neuromorphic control systems analysis and design amenable to mature control theoretical approaches like describing function analysis and harmonic balance, fast-slow analysis, discrete and hybrid systems, and robust optimization.</description>

      <title>Interior-Point Vanishing Problem in Semidefinite Relaxations for Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations. However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and secure systems with DNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, first we employ the penalization technique to analyze the Dirichlet boundary feedback control problem pertaining to reaction-diffusion equation. We establish the stabilization result of the equivalent Robin problem in the \(H^{2}\)-norm with respect to the penalty parameter. Furthermore, we prove that the solution of the penalized control problem converges to the corresponding solution of the Dirichlet boundary feedback control problem as the penalty parameter \(\epsilon\) approaches zero. A \(C^{0}\)-conforming finite element method is applied to this problem for the spatial variable while keeping the time variable continuous. We discuss the stabilization of the semi-discrete scheme for the penalized control problem and present an error analysis of its solution. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore, we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control in general, and flatness-based control in particular, of robotic arms necessitate to compute the first and second time derivatives of the joint torques/forces required to achieve a desired motion. In view of the required computational efficiency, recursive $O(n)$-algorithms were proposed to this end. Aiming at compact yet efficient formulations, a Lie group formulation was recently proposed, making use of body-fixed and hybrid representation of twists and wrenches. In this paper a formulation is introduced using the spatial representation. The second-order inverse dynamics algorithm is accompanied by a fourth-order forward and inverse kinematics algorithm. An advantage of all Lie group formulations is that they can be parameterized in terms of vectorial quantities that are readily available. The method is demonstrated for the 7 DOF Franka Emika Panda robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08907v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to their local quadratic convergence. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. We present the \emph{Second-Order Conditional Gradient Sliding} (SOCGS) algorithm, which uses a projection-free algorithm to solve the constrained quadratic subproblems inexactly. When the feasible region is a polytope the algorithm converges quadratically in primal gap after a finite number of linearly convergent iterations. Once in the quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log 1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log (1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although possible, is costly.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the control constrained distributed optimal control of a stationary doubly diffusive flow model. For the control problem, we use a well-posedness analysis based on minimal assumptions on data and domain. We show the existence of an optimal control with quadratic type cost functional, study the Fr\'echet differentiability properties of the control-to-state map and establish the first-order necessary optimality conditions corresponding to the optimal control problem. Expanding on this we prove the local optimality of a reference control using second-order sufficient optimality condition for the control problem.</description>

Abstract: Bandit convex optimisation is a fundamental framework for studying zeroth-order convex optimisation. This book covers the many tools used for this problem, including cutting plane methods, interior point methods, continuous exponential weights, gradient descent and online Newton step. The nuances between the many assumptions and setups are explained. Although there is not much truly new here, some existing tools are applied in novel ways to obtain new algorithms. A few bounds are improved in minor ways.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a policy learning algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria (GFNE) in $N_P$-player noncooperative dynamic games. We consider linear-quadratic games with stochastic dynamics and design a best-response dynamics in which players update and broadcast a parametrisation of their state-feedback policies. Our approach leverages the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework to formulate each player's update rule as the solution to a robust optimisation problem. Under certain conditions, rates of convergence to a feedback Nash equilibrium can be established. The algorithm is showcased in exemplary problems ranging from the decentralised control of unstable systems to competition in oligopolistic markets.</description>

Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the computation of minimal hyperbolic polynomials of duals of cones arising from chordal sparsity patterns. From that, we investigate the relation between ranks of homogeneous cones and their minimal polynomials. Along the way, we answer in the negative a question posed in an earlier paper and show examples of homogeneous cones that cannot be realized as rank-one generated (ROG) hyperbolicity cones.</description>

      <title>Dynamic FISTA for Convex Composite Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study convex bi-level optimization problems where both the inner and outer levels are given as a composite convex minimization. We propose the Fast Bi-level Proximal Gradient (FBi-PG) algorithm, which can be interpreted as applying FISTA to a dynamic regularized composite objective function. The dynamic nature of the regularization parameters allows to achieve an optimal fast convergence rate of $O(1/k^{2})$ in terms of the inner objective function. This is the fastest known convergence rate under no additional restrictive assumptions. We also show that FBi-PG achieves sub-linear simultaneous rates in terms of both the inner and outer objective functions. Moreover, we show that under an H\"olderian type error bound assumption on the inner objective function, the FBi-PG algorithm achieves improved simultaneous rates and converges to an optimal solution of the bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system and cost matrices. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</description>

      <title>Faces of homogeneous cones and applications to homogeneous chordality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convex cone $\mathcal{K}$ is said to be homogeneous if its group of automorphisms acts transitively on its relative interior. Important examples of homogeneous cones include symmetric cones and cones of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices that follow a sparsity pattern given by a homogeneous chordal graph. Our goal in this paper is to elucidate the facial structure of homogeneous cones and make it as transparent as the faces of the PSD matrices. We prove that each face of a homogeneous cone $\mathcal{K}$ is mapped by an automorphism of $\mathcal{K}$ to one of its finitely many so-called principal faces. Furthermore, constructing such an automorphism can be done algorithmically by making use of a generalized Cholesky decomposition. Among other consequences, we give a proof that homogeneous cones are projectionally exposed, which strengthens the previous best result that they are amenable. Using our results, we will carefully analyze the facial structure of cones of PSD matrices satisfying homogeneous chordality and discuss consequences for the corresponding family of PSD completion problems.</description>

      <title>A convex variational principle for the necessary conditions of classical optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scheme for generating a family of convex variational principles is developed, the Euler- Lagrange equations of each member of the family formally corresponding to the necessary conditions of optimal control of a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in a well-defined sense. The scheme is applied to the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator problem for which an explicit form of the functional is derived, and existence of minimizers of the variational principle is rigorously shown. It is shown that the Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem with time-dependent forcing can be solved within the formalism without requiring any nonlinear considerations, in contrast to the use of a Riccati system in the classical methodology.
  Our work demonstrates a pathway for solving nonlinear control problems via convex optimization.</description>

      <title>A Generating Polynomial Based Two-Stage Optimization Method for Tensor Rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rank decomposition, also known as canonical polyadic (CP) or simply tensor decomposition, has a long-standing history in multilinear algebra. However, computing a CP decomposition becomes particularly challenging when the tensor's rank lies between its largest and second-largest dimensions. Moreover, a common approach to address high-order tensor decompositions is to first flatten them into an order-3 tensor, where a significant gap often exists between the largest and the second-largest dimension, also making this case crucial in practice. In such a case, traditional optimization methods, such as nonlinear least squares or alternative least squares methods, often fail to produce accurate tensor decompositions. There are also direct methods, such as the normal form algorithm and the method by Domanov and De Lathauwer, that solve tensor decompositions algebraically. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and demand substantial memory, especially when the tensor rank is high. This paper introduces a novel generating polynomial (GP) based two-stage algorithm for the order-3 nonsymmetric tensor decomposition problem, assuming the rank does not exceed the largest dimension. The proposed method reformulates the tensor decomposition problem into two sequential optimization problems. Notably, if the first-stage optimization yields only a partial solution, it will be effectively utilized in the second stage. We establish the theoretical equivalence between the CP decomposition and the global minimizers of those two-stage optimization problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is both efficient and robust, capable of finding tensor decompositions in scenarios where the current state-of-the-art methods often fail.</description>

      <title>On resolution of L1-norm minimization via a two-metric adaptive projection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-metric projection method is a simple yet elegant algorithm proposed by Bertsekas to address bound/box-constrained optimization problems. The algorithm's low per-iteration cost and potential for using Hessian information make it a favorable computation method for this problem class. Inspired by this algorithm, we propose a two-metric adaptive projection method for solving the $\ell_1$-norm regularization problem that inherits these advantages. We demonstrate that the method is theoretically sound - it has global convergence. Furthermore, it is capable of manifold identification and has superlinear convergence rate under the error bound condition and strict complementarity. Therefore, given sparsity in the solution, the method enjoys superfast convergence in iteration while maintaining scalability, making it desirable for large-scale problems. We also equip the algorithm with competitive complexity to solve nonconvex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the advantages of this algorithm implied by the theory compared to other competitive methods, especially in large-scale scenarios. In contrast to the original two-metric projection method, our algorithm directly solves the $\ell_1$-norm minimization problem without resorting to the intermediate reformulation as a bound-constrained problem, so it circumvents the issue of numerical instability.</description>

      <title>Empirical and computer-aided robustness analysis of long-step and accelerated methods in smooth convex optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations. Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.</description>

      <title>BDF schemes for accelerated gradient flows in projection-free approximation of nonconvex constrained variational minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel algorithms combining accelerated gradient flows with linearized projection-free treatments of non-convex constraints and BDF pseudo-temporal discretization for quadratic energy minimization. A general framework is developed to analyze constraint violations in such projection-free techniques for quadratic constraints. This analysis proves to be universal to all projection-free iterative methods, and constraint error bounds depend solely on iterate regularity. For BDF-k(k=1,2,3,4), we derive both unconditional and conditional high-order constraint violation estimates for accelerated gradient flows using our framework. We further discover a new family of BDF-k accelerated gradient methods achieving modified energy stability for arbitrary positive integer k. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing gradient flow approaches.</description>

      <title>Decision Making under the Exponential Family: Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty is challenging as the data-generating process (DGP) is often unknown. Bayesian inference proceeds by estimating the DGP through posterior beliefs on the model's parameters. However, minimising the expected risk under these beliefs can lead to suboptimal decisions due to model uncertainty or limited, noisy observations. To address this, we introduce Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-BAS) which hedges against model uncertainty by optimising the worst-case risk over a posterior-informed ambiguity set. We provide two such sets, based on posterior expectations (DRO-BAS(PE)) or posterior predictives (DRO-BAS(PP)) and prove that both admit, under conditions, strong dual formulations leading to efficient single-stage stochastic programs which are solved with a sample average approximation. For DRO-BAS(PE) this covers all conjugate exponential family members while for DRO-BAS(PP) this is shown under conditions on the predictive's moment generating function. Our DRO-BAS formulations outperform existing Bayesian DRO on the Newsvendor problem and achieve faster solve times with comparable robustness on the Portfolio problem.</description>

      <title>Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Approach for Fast Optimal Control of a Stefan Problem with Application to Cell Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes a new, efficient way of finding control and state trajectories in optimal control problems by reformulation as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The optimal control and state vectors can be obtained via simulation of the resulting DAE system with the selected DAE solver, eliminating the need for an optimization solver. Our simulation-based approach is demonstrated and benchmarked against various optimization-based algorithms via four case studies associated with the optimization and control of a Stefan problem for cell therapy. The simulation-based approach is faster than every optimization-based method by more than an order of magnitude while giving similar/better accuracy in all cases. The solution obtained from the simulation-based approach is guaranteed to be optimal provided that at least one constraint or algebraic equation resulting from the reformulation remains active at all times. The proposed technique offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control, serving as a promising alternative to the traditional techniques in applications where speed is crucial, e.g., real-time online model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the condition number of the weight matrix and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We control these issues by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations, yielding the regularized algorithm ReBlocK. Numerical experiments including examples arising from natural gradient optimization demonstrate that ReBlocK can outperform both RBK and minibatch stochastic gradient descent for inconsistent problems with rapidly decaying singular values.</description>

      <title>Assortment Optimization for Patient-Provider Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rising provider turnover results in frequently needing to rematch patients with available providers. However, the rematching process is cumbersome for both patients and health systems, resulting in labor-intensive and ad hoc reassignments. We propose a novel patient-provider matching approach to address this issue by offering patients limited provider menus. The goal is to maximize match quality across the system while preserving patient choice. We frame this as a novel variant of assortment optimization, where patient-specific provider menus are offered upfront, and patients respond in a random sequence to make their selections. This hybrid offline-online setting is understudied in previous literature and captures system dynamics across various domains. We first demonstrate that a greedy baseline policy--which offers all providers to all patients--can maximize the match rate but lead to low-quality matches. Based on this, we construct a set of policies and demonstrate that the best policy depends on problem specifics, such as a patient's willingness to match and the ratio of patients to providers. On real-world data, our proposed policy improves average match quality by 13% over a greedy solution by tailoring assortments based on patient characteristics. Our analysis reveals a tradeoff between menu size and system-wide match quality, highlighting the value of balancing patient choice with centralized planning.</description>

      <title>Qronos: Correcting the Past by Shaping the Future... in Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Algorithm Based on Beam Search and Iterated Local Search for the Maritime Inventory Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib, aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances. However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons, this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon, single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72 instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution for 19 instances within an acceptable CPU time.</description>
