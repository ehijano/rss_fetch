      <title>Magneto-optical spectroscopy based on pump-probe strobe light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Optical excitations and disorder in two-dimensional topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter have garnered significant interest over the past two decades for two main reasons: their identification, via topological invariants, relies on the quantum geometry of the Bloch states, bringing attention to an aspect of electronic band structure overlooked up to their discovery. Secondly, these classes of materials present electronic states with unusual properties, leading to exotic phenomena and making them relevant for potential applications. In this thesis we explore both fundamental and technological aspects of the first discovered topological phase: the topological insulator. To this end, we consider different models of topological insulators with a particular emphasis on Bismuth compounds, evaluating their viability for photovoltaic applications, and separately, the impact of structural disorder on their properties.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot All-Optical Switching in CoFeB/MgO Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate single shot al optical switching (AOS) in rare earth free CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a material system widely adopted in spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM). By tuning the capping layer thickness, we show that precise heat control enables deterministic magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP) state. Furthermore, we detect magnetization reversal in a micro scale MTJ device via the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Our findings suggest that ultrafast spin transport or dipolar interactions or a combination of both may play essential roles in the switching process. This work represents a significant step toward integrating AOS with MTJ technology.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Correlated Charge-Ordered Phases in 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for controlling the structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional materials, particularly in systems hosting charge density wave (CDW) order. In this work, we apply uniaxial tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS2 flakes using a flexible, device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent behavior of the nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase transition. This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature. Electrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the strain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that piezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window. These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain and displacement.</description>

      <title>Stability of Planar Slits in Multilayer Graphite Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model, planar slits in multilayer graphite crystals are simulated. It is shown that when covering a linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal with a multilayer graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit) can form only if the cavity width does not exceed a critical value L_o (for width L&gt;L_o, only a closed state of the slit is formed, with the cavity space filled by the covering sheet). The critical width of the open slit L_o increases monotonically with the number of layers K in the covering sheet. For a single-layer cavity, there is a finite critical value of its width L_o&lt;3nm, while for two- and three-layer cavities, the maximum width of the open slit increases infinitely with increasing K as a power function K^\alpha with exponent 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. Inside the crystal, two- and three-layer slits can have stable open states at any width. For a slit with width L&gt;7.6nm, a stationary closed state is also possible, in which its lower and upper surfaces adhere to each other. Simulation of thermal oscillations showed that open states of two-layer slits with width L&lt;15nm are always stable against thermal oscillations, while wider slits at T&gt;400K transition from the open to the closed state. Open states of three-layer slits are always stable against thermal oscillations.</description>

      <title>Effects of interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the shape and dynamics of magnetic twin-skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.</description>

      <title>A Topological Sum Rule for the Chirality of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are fundamentally governed by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The lack of a predictive theory directly connecting the architecture of the nucleation cap to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here, we derive a universal topological sum rule that quantifies this relationship. We show that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the sum of the coordinates of the six pentagons in the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon positions overwhelmingly leads to a predictable, quanti able, and entropically irreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential formation of the (126) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the &lt;111&gt; catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</description>

      <title>Strongly nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene reveal plasmon-enhanced near-field magnetoabsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strongly enhanced lifetime of higher-order bimerons and antibimerons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic bimerons, similar to skyrmions, are topologically nontrivial spin textures characterized by topological charge $Q$. Most studies so far have focused on low-$Q$ solitons ($|Q| \leq 1$), such as skyrmions, bimerons, and vortices. Here, we present the first calculations of the lifetimes of high-$Q$ bimerons and demonstrate that they are fundamentally more stable than high-$Q$ skyrmions over a wide range of temperature. To obtain realistic results, our chosen system is an experimentally feasible van der Waals interface, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. We show that the lifetimes of high-$Q$ (anti)bimerons can exceed the lifetime of those with $|Q|=1$ by 3 orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this trend remains valid even when extrapolated to room temperature (RT), as the lifetimes are dominated by entropy rather than energy barriers. This contrasts with high-$Q$ skyrmions, whose lifetimes fall with $|Q|$ near RT. We attribute this fundamental difference between skyrmions and bimerons to their distinct magnetic texture symmetries, which lead to different entropy-dominated lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect in Correlated Antiferromagnetic V2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect is useful for probing the spin correlations and magnetic order in magnetic insulators. Here, we report a strong longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic V2O3 thin films. The LSSE response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the external magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and field exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak that shifts toward higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness, implying that the bulk SSE dominates any interfacial contribution. This negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that the magnon energy relaxation length in V2O3 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest film, 50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material.</description>

      <title>Using Crossed Andreev Reflection to Split Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscopic systems possess shot noise in their currents due to the quantization of the conducting quasiparticles. Measurements of this shot noise are useful to study phenomena that do not manifest themselves in standard conductance or resistance measurements, such as the statistics of the conducting quasiparticles or quantum entanglement via Bell tests. The corresponding particle statistics can be determined via two particle quantum interference experiments, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect which demonstrates a bunching effect for bosons or an anti-bunching effect in fermions. In superconducting proximity junctions, electrons incident on a superconductor can induce holes via crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) in spatially separated normal metal leads, where the resulting hole currents have nontrivial partition noise due to the four terminal configuration. These nonlocally generated currents, using a superconductor as a mesoscopic beam splitter, enable fabrication of mesoscopic analogs to quantum optics interferometers using metallic and superconducting films with multiport geometries.</description>

      <title>Optical Gain Through Metallic Electro-Optical Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical gain is a critical process in today's semiconductor technology and it is most often achieved via stimulated emission. In this theoretical study, we find a resonant TE mode in biased low-symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems which may lead to optical gain in the absence of stimulated emission. We do so by first modeling the optical conductivity using Boltzmann non-equilibrium transport theory and then simulating the scattering problem using a scattered-wave formalism. Assuming that the system may possess a Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and a non-zero Magnetoelectric tensor (MET), we find that the optical conductivity has a non-trivial dependence on the direction of the applied bias, which allows for probing the TE mode. After analyzing the system with one of each of the effects, we find that the resonant TE mode is only accessible when both effects are present. Further studies are necessary to find materials with a suitably large BCD and MET, in order to realize the predictions within this study.</description>

      <title>Fast high-fidelity baseband reset of a latched state for quantum dot qubit readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one logical qubit state, either $|1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle$, onto a different, metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior charge sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long enough that the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the passive reset out of latched states is inherently long, which is not desirable. In this work, we demonstrate an on-demand, high fidelity (&gt; 99%) re-initialization of a quantum dot qubit out of a latched readout state. The method is simple to apply as it involves a single baseband voltage pulse to a specific region in the quantum dot stability diagram where the relaxation time from the latched state to the ground state is over 50 times faster. We describe the mechanism for the reset process as well as the boundaries for the optimal reset region in the qubit gate voltage space.</description>

Abstract: Investigating the robustness of non-reciprocity in the presence of competing interactions is central to understanding non-reciprocal quantum matter. In this work, we use reservoir engineering to induce non-reciprocal hopping and pairing in the fermionic Kitaev chain, and reveal the emergence of a pairing-induced phase transition. The two phases appear in the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Kitaev Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of correlations, separated by an exceptional point. In the non-reciprocal phase, dynamics are characterized by directionality and slow relaxation, and the steady state supports non-reciprocal density and spatial correlations. At strong pairing, we uncover an unexpected density wave phase, featuring short relaxation times, a modulation in particle occupation and strikingly different correlation spreading depending on pairing non-reciprocity. Our work highlights the non-trivial breakdown of non-reciprocity due to superconducting pairing and invites experimental investigation of non-reciprocal fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Contactless cavity sensing of superfluid stiffness in atomically thin 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges of two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-induced effects from Wess-Zumino-Witten terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study vorticity-induced effects arising from the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for Nambu-Goldstone modes in chiral perturbation theory. We first provide an alternative derivation of the Wess-Zumino-Witten terms in the presence of external vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar fields using a derivative expansion of the fermion determinant. We then employ the previously found correspondence in which vorticity is treated as an axial-vector field coupled to Dirac fermions in flat spacetime. Using this, we derive vorticity-induced contributions for Nambu-Goldstone modes in the presence of electromagnetic fields at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials, including a vorticity-induced current, a magnetic-field-induced angular momentum, and a vorticity-modified photon-pion coupling. We also briefly discuss the phenomenological implications of these vorticity-induced effects.</description>

      <title>Second-order Stark shifts exceeding 10$\,$GHz in electrically contacted SiV$^-$ centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$) in diamond exhibit excellent spin coherence and optical properties, making them promising candidates for quantum technologies. However, the strain-induced inhomogeneous distribution of optical transition frequencies poses a challenge for scalability. We demonstrate electrical tuning of the SiV$^-$ center zero-phonon lines using in-plane contacts to apply moderate electric fields up to 45$\,$MV/m. The second-order Stark shift exceeds 10$\,$GHz, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 15$\,$GHz inhomogeneous distribution of SiV$^-$ observed in emitters embedded in optical nanostructures such as photonic crystal nanocavities. Analysis of individual SiV$^-$ centers shows significant variation in polarizabilities between defects indicating that the polarizability strongly depends on local parameters like strain. The observed polarizabilities are 3-25 times larger than those of tin vacancy centers, which we attribute to valence band resonances that delocalize the $e_u$ wavefunctions. Photoluminescence excitation measurements reveal that optical linewidths increase moderately with applied electric field strength. Our results demonstrate that large electrical Stark shifts can overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of transition frequencies, representing a significant step toward scalable SiV$^-$-based quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Disordered Parity Anomalous Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parity anomalous semimetal is a topological state of matter characterized by its semi-metallic nature and a quantum Hall conductance of one-half $e^{2}/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant). Here we investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a semi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak topological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states defined over a parameter space form a Grassmann manifold. To capture the geometry of the associated gauge structure, gauge-invariant quantities are essential. We employ the projector of a multilevel system to quantify the quantum distance between states. Using the multidimensional scaling method, we transform the quantum distance into a reconstructed manifold embedded in Euclidean space. This approach is demonstrated with examples of topological systems, showcasing their topological features within these manifolds. Our method provides a comprehensive view of the manifold, rather than focusing on local properties.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of coercivity for isolated Ni nanowires unraveled by high-sensitivity micromagnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic nanowires are critical components in fields such as data storage and spintronics, where precise control of their magnetic properties is essential for device optimization. In particular, the behavior of isolated nanowires is often different from that of an ensemble, offering an opportunity to explore the role that dipolar and magnetoelastic interactions play in the latter system. Unfortunately, the comparison between a collection of nanowires and single ones is often poorly characterized, as measuring individual nanowires with weak magnetic signals is a challenging task. In this work, we employ a highly-sensitive micromechanical torsional oscillator to measure the magnetic response of few individual Ni nanowires with 72 +/- 5 nm average diameter, fabricated by electrodeposition in anodic aluminum oxide templates as an array and subsequently released from this membrane. When comparing the magnetic properties as a function of temperature between single nanowires and the array, we show that coercivity values of individual nanowires are at least twice as large as for the array in the range 5 K - 200 K. Also, we characterize the differences in the hysteresis loops, which are more squared for isolated nanowires, with a high magnetic remanence close to 80 % of the saturation value. Our results highlight the crucial role of dipolar and mechanical interactions in modifying the magnetic behavior of nanowires arrays, providing valuable insights for the design and application of nanowires-based magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Virtual Gates Enabled by Digital Surrogate of Quantum Dot Devices</title>

Abstract: Advances in quantum technologies are often limited by slow device characterization, complex tuning requirements, and scalability challenges. Spin qubits in electrostatically defined quantum dots provide a promising platform but are not exempt from these limitations. Simulations enhance our understanding of such devices, and in many cases, rapid feedback between measurements and simulations can guide the development of optimal design and control strategies. Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that acts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where computationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum dot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a double quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. We envision that this simulation framework will advance semiconductor-based quantum technologies by enabling more efficient design, characterization, and control of complex devices.</description>

      <title>N\'eel proximity effect at antiferromagnet/superconductor interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-splitting induced in a conventional superconductor weakens superconductivity by destroying spin-singlet and creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that such an effect is also caused by an adjacent compensated antiferromagnet, which yields no net spin-splitting. We find that the antiferromagnet produces N\'eel triplet Cooper pairs, whose pairing amplitude oscillates rapidly in space similar to the antiferromagnet's spin. The emergence of these unconventional Cooper pairs reduces the singlet pairs' amplitude, thereby lowering the superconducting critical temperature. We develop a quasiclassical Green's functions description of the system employing a two-sublattice framework. It successfully captures the rapid oscillations in the Cooper pairs' amplitude at the lattice spacing scale as well as their smooth variation on the larger coherence length scale. Employing the theoretical framework thus developed, we investigate this N\'eel proximity effect in a superconductor/antiferromagnet bilayer as a function of interfacial exchange, disorder, and chemical potential, finding rich physics. Our findings also offer insights into experiments which have found a larger than expected suppression of superconductivity by an adjacent antiferromagnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andreev bound states can occur at single impurities in superconductors if the impurities suppress superconductivity for a given system. In particular, well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors. Here we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities in S/AF heterostructures with conventional intraband s-wave pairing also produce Andreev bound states. Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet pairing generated at the impurity.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here, we show how a topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm would fail. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal stationary phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single-mode and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of the steady-state peaks.</description>

      <title>Superstrong Dynamics and Directional Emission of a Giant Atom in a Structured Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA modes, selectively enhancing interaction with even and long-wavelength modes, while suppressing coupling to odd and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, long-wavelength modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking spatial inversion symmetry of the CCA, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a directional photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.</description>
