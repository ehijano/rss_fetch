      <title>"Rosenbluth" separation of the $J/\psi $ near-threshold photoproduction -- an access to the gluon Gravitational Form Factors at high $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the near-threshold $J/\psi $ photoproduction data off the proton based on the high skewness expansion ( $\xi \to 1$) of the cross-section in Ref. [1]. This expansion allows to separate the corresponding gluonic form factors, in much the same way as this is done in the electro-magnetic case with the Rosenbluth separation. We examine the independence of the extracted form factors with the photon beam energy. In Ref. [1] these form factors, in the leading-moment approximation, are related to the proton's gluon Gravitational Form Factors (gGFF). Using this approximation, we compare the extracted data points with lattice calculations in the region of momentum transfer squared of $1&lt;|t|&lt;2$ GeV$^{2}$, where the data and lattice results overlap. Such analysis demonstrates the possibility of extracting some combinations of the gGFFs from the data at high $t$, complementary to the lattice calculations available in the low $t$ region. However, higher statistics is needed to more accurately check the predicted $\xi$-scaling behavior of the data and compare with the lattice results, thus testing the theoretical assumptions used in Ref. [1].</description>

      <title>Contribution to differential $\pi^0$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{dir}$ modification in small systems from color fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major complication in the search for jet quenching in proton- or deuteron-nucleus collision systems is the presence of physical effects which influence the experimental determination of collision centrality in the presence of a hard process. For example, in the proton color fluctuation picture, protons with a large Bjorken-$x$ ($x \gtrsim 0.1$) parton interact more weakly with the nucleons in the nucleus, leading to a smaller (larger) than expected yield in large (small) activity events. A recent measurement by PHENIX compared the yield of neutral pion and direct photon production in $d$+Au collisions, under the argument that the photon yields correct for such biases, and the difference between the two species is thus attributable to final-state effects (i.e., jet quenching). The main finding suggests a significant degree of jet quenching for hard processes in small systems. In this paper, I argue that the particular photon and pion events selected by PHENIX arise from proton configurations with significantly different Bjorken-$x$ distributions, and thus are subject to different magnitudes of modification in the color fluctuation model. Using the results of a previous global analysis of RHIC and LHC data, I show that potentially all of the pion-to-photon difference in PHENIX data can be described by a proton color fluctuation picture at a quantitative level before any additional physics from final-state effects is required. This finding reconciles the interpretation of the PHENIX measurement with others at RHIC and LHC, which have found no observable evidence for jet quenching in small systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring system size dependence of jet modification in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been extensively studied, revealing important insights into the properties of the color deconfined nuclear matter. Over the past decade, there has been a surge of interest in the exploration of QGP droplets in small collision systems like $p$+$p$ or $p$+A collisions driven by the observation of collective flow phenomena. However, the absence of jet quenching, a key QGP signature, in these systems poses a puzzle. Understanding how jet quenching evolves with system size is crucial for uncovering the underlying physics. In this study, we employ the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to investigate jet modification in $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru, $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Our findings highlight the system size sensitivity exhibited by jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and jet shape ($\rho$), contrasting to the relatively weak responses of jet mass ($M$), girth ($g$) and momentum dispersion ($p_\mathrm{T}{D}$) to system size variations. These results offer invaluable insights into the system size dependence of the QGP properties and to be validated experimentally at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Detailed derivation of the $\mathbf{^3P_0}$ strong decay model applied to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-detail derivation through the $^3P_0$ pair creation model of the transition matrix for a baryon decaying into a meson-baryon system. The meson's analysis was conducted in Ref. [1] and we extend the same formalism to the baryon sector, focusing on the $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ strong decay width because all hadrons involved in the reaction are very well established, the two hadrons in the final state are stable, avoiding further analysis, all quarks are light and so equivalent, and the decay width of the process is relatively well measured. Taking advantage of a Gaussian expansion method for the hadron's radial wave functions, the expression of the invariant matrix element can be related with the mean-square radii of hadrons involved in the decay. We use their experimental measures in such a way that only the strength of the quark-antiquark pair creation from the vacuum is a free parameter. This is then taken from our previous study of strong decay widths in the meson sector, obtaining a quite compatible result with experiment for the calculated $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ decay width.</description>

      <title>Implication of odd-even staggering in the charge radii of calcium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the evidently observed odd-even staggering and the inverted parabolic-like shape of charge radii along calcium isotopic chain, the ground state properties of calcium isotopes are investigated by constraining the root-mean-square (rms) charge radii under the covariant energy density functionals with effective forces NL3 and PK1. In this work, the pairing correlations are tackled by solving the state-dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations. The calculated results suggest that the binding energies obtained by constraint method have been reduced less than $0.1\%$. But for charge radii, the corresponding results deriving from NL3 and PK1 forces have been increased by about $1.0\%$ and $2.0\%$, respectively. This means that charge radius is a more sensitive quantity in the calibrated protocol. Meanwhile, it is found that the reproduced charge radii of calcium isotopes is attributed to the rather strong isospin dependence of effective potential. The odd-even oscillation behavior can also be presented in the neutron skin thickness and proton Fermi energy along calcium isotopic chain, but keep opposite trends with respect to the corresponding binding energy and charge radius. As encountered in charge radii, the weakening odd-even oscillation behavior is still emerged from the proton Fermi energies at the neutron numbers $N=20$ and $28$ as well, but not in binding energy and neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are resonances or virtual states. We demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between such two scenarios. More concretely, we show that the $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions are significantly different in the high-momentum region, especially in small collision systems of the order of 1 fm, as produced in pp collisions at the LHC, which can unambiguously tell whether $Z_c(3900)$/$Z_{cs}(3985)$ is a resonant or a virtual state. For the $Z_{cs}(3985)$, the $D^0D_s^{*-}$ results at zero momentum are significantly different in the two scenarios. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolutions, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional charged kaon femtoscopy in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.12310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlations of identical charged kaons were measured in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The femtoscopic invariant radii and correlation strengths were extracted from one-dimensional kaon correlation functions and were compared with those obtained in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV, respectively. The presented results also complement the identical-pion femtoscopic data published by the ALICE collaboration. The extracted radii increase with increasing charged-particle multiplicity and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum. At comparable multiplicities, the radii measured in p-Pb collisions are found to be close to those observed in pp collisions. The obtained femtoscopic parameters are reproduced by the EPOS 3 hadronic interaction model and disfavor models with large initial size or strong collective expansion at low multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a toroidal electric dipole mode in nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipole toroidal modes appear in many fields of physics. In nuclei, such a mode was predicted more than 50 years ago, but clear experimental evidence was lacking so far. Using a combination of high-resolution inelastic scattering experiments with photons, electrons and protons, we identify for the first time candidates for toroidal dipole excitations in the nucleus $^{58}$Ni and demonstrate that transverse electron scattering form factors represent a relevant experimental observable to prove their nature.</description>

      <title>Searching for Two-Neutrino and Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay of $^{134}$Xe with the PandaX-4T Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^{134}$Xe is a candidate isotope for neutrinoless double beta decay~($0\nu\beta\beta$) search. In addition, the two-neutrino case ($2\nu\beta\beta$) allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics has not yet been observed. Utilizing the 10.4% of $^{134}$Xe in the natural xenon in the PandaX-4T detector and its first 94.9-day exposure, we have established the most stringent constraints on $2\nu\beta\beta$ and $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{134}$Xe half-lives, with limits of $2.8\times10^{22}$ yr and $3.0\times10^{23}$ yr at 90% confidence level, respectively. The $2\nu\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) limit surpasses the previously reported best result by a factor of 32 (2.7), highlighting the potential of large monolithic natural xenon detectors.</description>

      <title>Population of tetraneutron continuum in reactions of $^{8}$He on deuterium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17354v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search for the population of the low-energy continuum of tetraneutron system was performed for the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li)$^4n$ and $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H$\rightarrow ^3$H+$^4n$ reactions. Evidence for a hump in the $^4n$ continuum at $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $3.2 \pm 0.8$ MeV, respectively, was observed in both reactions. The observed statistics is quite low (6 and up to 40 events) corresponding to very low cross sections of few microbarns or tens of microbarns. The background conditions for the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li)$^4n$ reaction are shown to be good, favoring the physical nature of the observed events. The $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H$\rightarrow ^3$H+$^4n$ process transforms to the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li$^{\ast})^4n$ reaction in the limit of the highest $^7$H decay energies. The population of the low-energy region in the $^{4}$n spectrum is found to be perfectly correlated with the population of the lowest $^{6}$Li states in the $^{3}$He+$^{3}$H continuum. Theoretical calculations of $^{8}$He in a five-body $\alpha$+$4n$ and of $^{4}$n in a four-body hyperspherical models are presented. The $^{8}$He wave function is shown to contain strong specific correlations, which may give rise to very low-energy structures in tetraneutron continuum in extreme-peripheral reaction scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The masses of $^{84}$Br, $^{105}$Mo, $^{115,119,121}$Pd, $^{122}$Ag, $^{127,129}$In, $^{132}$Sb and their respective isomeric states have been measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique. The excitation energies of the isomeric states in $^{132}$Sb and $^{119}$Pd were experimentally determined for the first time, while for $^{84}$Br, $^{115}$Pd and $^{127,129}$In, the precision of the mass values was substantially improved. In $^{105}$Mo and $^{121}$Pd there were no signs of a long-lived isomeric state. The ground-state measurements of $^{119}$Pd and $^{122}$Ag indicated that both are significantly more bound than the literature values. For $^{122}$Ag, there was no indication of a proposed third long-lived state. The results for the $N=49$ nucleus $^{84}$Br and isomers close to doubly magic $^{132}$Sn have been compared to the shell-model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model calculations.</description>

Abstract: The dineutron as a bound chargeless nucleus of two identical nucleons has been attracting attention for many decades. In addition to the study of the formation of a bound dineutron in the outgoing channel of some specific nuclear reactions, cross section estimates have been gaining interest as research target. We used a traditional neutron activation technique to irradiate Lu samples followed by measurements of the induced activity with HPGe spectrometer in order to detect gamma-peaks of the ${}^{175}Lu (n, 2n)^{174g}Lu$ reaction product when this reaction channel is not open for incident neutron energies. Based on two measurements of the instrumental gamma ray spectra of Lu samples we reliably identified the presence of the ${}^{174g}Lu$ isotope in the outgoing channel of the ${}^{175}Lu(n, {}^2n)^{174g}Lu$ nuclear reaction. Also, the cross section for this nuclear reaction was obtained and to be equal $33.5 \pm 5.9$ mb. For the first time, the dineutron as a nuclear reaction product was indirectly detected via statistically significant observation of the induced activity of ${}^{174g}Lu$ with corresponding cross-section estimate.</description>

Abstract: The rich phenomenology of quantum many-body systems such as atomic nuclei is complex to interpret. Often, the behaviour (e.g. evolution with the number of constituents) of measurable/observable quantities such as binding or excitation energies can be best understood on the basis of a simplified picture involving auxiliary quantities that are not observable, i.e. whose values vary with parameters that are internal to the theoretical construction (contrarily to measurable/observable quantities). While being useful, the simplified interpretation is thus theoretical-scheme-dependent. This applies, in particular, to the so-called single-nucleon shell structure based on auxiliary effective single-particle energies (ESPEs). In this context, the present work aims at (i) recalling the way to compute ESPEs out of solutions of many-body Schr\"odinger's equation, (ii) illustrating the use of ESPEs within the frame of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations to interpret the outcome of a recent nuclear experiment and (iii) demonstrating the impact of several alterations to the computation of ESPEs. While the chosen alterations constitute approximations within the ab initio scheme, they are built-in when employing other theoretical constructs at play in nuclear physics. The present considerations are thus meant to empirically illustrate variations that can be expected between ESPEs computed within different (equally valid) theoretical schemes.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on the existence and lifetime of a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon</title>

Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we follow EFT methods to evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^5$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate.</description>
