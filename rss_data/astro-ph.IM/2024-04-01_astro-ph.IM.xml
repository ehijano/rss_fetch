      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Satellite State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community routinely tracks satellites in orbit by fitting an orbital state to observations made by the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). In order to fit such orbits, an accurate model of the forces that are acting on the satellite is required. Over the past several decades, high-quality, physics-based models have been developed for satellite state estimation and propagation. These models are exceedingly good at estimating and propagating orbital states for non-maneuvering satellites; however, there are several classes of anomalous accelerations that a satellite might experience which are not well-modeled, such as satellites that use low-thrust electric propulsion to modify their orbit. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a valuable tool for these classes of satellites as they combine physics models with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are highly expressive and versatile function approximators. By combining a physics model with a DNN, the machine learning model need not learn astrodynamics, which results in more efficient and effective utilization of machine learning resources. This paper details the application of PINNs to estimate the orbital state and a continuous, low-amplitude anomalous acceleration profile for satellites. The PINN is trained to learn the unknown acceleration by minimizing the mean square error of observations. We evaluate the performance of pure physics models with PINNs in terms of their observation residuals and their propagation accuracy beyond the fit span of the observations. For a two-day simulation of a GEO satellite using an unmodeled acceleration profile on the order of $10^{-8} \text{ km/s}^2$, the PINN outperformed the best-fit physics model by orders of magnitude for both observation residuals (123 arcsec vs 1.00 arcsec) as well as propagation accuracy (3860 km vs 164 km after five days).</description>

      <title>Deeper Learning in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the best way to understand astronomical data is through machine learning, where a "black box" is set up, inside which a kind of artificial intelligence learns how to interpret the features in the data. We suggest that perhaps there may be some merit to a new approach in which humans are used instead of machines to understand the data. This may even apply to fields other than astronomy.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Orbital Parameters from (u,v)-coverage for a Space Radio Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a suitable very long baseline (VLBI) interferometer geometry is a key task in planning observations, especially imaging sessions. The main characteristic of the quality of VLBI imaging data is the (u, v)-coverage. In the case when one or more radio telescopes are located in space, this task becomes more complex. This paper presents a method for recovering the optimal orbital parameters of space radio telescopes for a given desired (u, v)-coverage, which in turn is the inverse task of searching for the optimal geometry and orbital configurations of space-ground and pure space VLBI interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at facilitating the visualization of astrophysical data for several tasks, such as uncovering patterns, presenting results to the community, and facilitating the understanding of complex physical relationships to the public. We present pastamarkers, a customized Python package fully compatible with matplotlib, that contains unique pasta-shaped markers meant to enhance the visualization of astrophysical data. We prove that using different pasta types as markers can improve the clarity of astrophysical plots by reproducing some of the most famous plots in the literature.</description>

      <title>Satellite Visibility During the April 2024 Total Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 8 April 2024, tens of millions of people across North America will be able to view a total solar eclipse. Such astronomical events have been important throughout history, but with nearly 10,000 satellites in orbit, we question whether total eclipses will now reveal a sky full of satellites, fundamentally changing this experience for humanity. Using the current population of Starlink satellites, we find that the brightest satellites would be naked-eye visible in dark skies, but the high sky brightness during totality will make them undetectable to the unaided eye. Our model does not take into account the effects of chance reflections from large, flat surfaces like solar panels, which we expect will cause glints and flares that could be visible from large satellites and abandoned rocket bodies. Time-lapse all-sky imaging might reveal satellites during the eclipse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been accepted that the cosmos determine our personalities, relationships, and even our fate. Unlike our condensed matter colleagues - who regularly use quantum mechanics to determine the healing properties of crystals - astrology techniques have been unchanged since the 19th century. In this paper, we discuss how astrophysical messengers beyond starlight can be used to predict the future and excuse an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of our negative personality traits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning-based method for extracting HI sources from 3D spectral data, and construct a dedicated dataset of HI sources from CRAFTS. Our custom dataset provides comprehensive resources for HI source detection. Utilizing the 3D-Unet segmentation architecture, our method reliably identifies and segments HI sources, achieving notable performance metrics with recall rates reaching 91.6% and accuracy levels at 95.7%. These outcomes substantiate the value of our custom dataset and the efficacy of our proposed network in identifying HI source.

      <title>Why FLAMINGO is the perfect name for an array of Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues why FLAMINGO (Fast Light Atmospheric Monitoring and Imaging Novel Gamma-ray Observatory) is the perfect name for an array of very-high-energy Cherenkov telescopes. Studies which indicate pink is the most suitable pigment for the structures of Cherenkov telescopes have passed with flying colors. Pink optimizes the absorption and reflectivity properties of the telescopes with respect to the characteristic blue color of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by high-energy particles in the atmosphere. In addition to giving the sensitivity a big leg up, a pink color scheme also adds a unique and visually appealing aspect to the project's branding and outreach efforts. FLAMINGO has a fun and memorable quality that can help to increase public engagement and interest in astrophysics and also help to promote diversity in the field with its colorful nature. In an era of increasingly unpronounceable scientific acronyms, we are putting our foot down. FLAMINGO is particularly fitting, as flamingos have eyesight optimized to detect small particles, aligning with the primary purpose of Cherenkov telescopes to detect faint signals from air showers. We should not wait in the wings just wishing for new name to come along: in FLAMINGO we have an acronym that both accurately reflects the science behind Cherenkov telescopes and provides a visually striking identity for the project. While such a sea change will be no easy feet, we are glad to stick our necks out and try: FLAMINGO captures the essence of what an array of Cherenkov telescopes represents and can help to promote the science to a wider audience. We aim to create an experiment and brand that people from all walks of life will flock to.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A modern highly-parallel gravity and smoothed particle hydrodynamics solver for astrophysical and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have become one of the key tools used by theorists in all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code SWIFT. The software package exploits hybrid shared- and distributed-memory task-based parallelism, asynchronous communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. SWIFT also evolves neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code architecture, summarise the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed, and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run with SWIFT.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly at scale: searching for anomalies amongst 4 million galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys are producing datasets of unprecedented size and richness, increasing the potential for high-impact scientific discovery. This possibility, coupled with the challenge of exploring a large number of sources, has led to the development of novel machine-learning-based anomaly detection approaches, such as Astronomaly. For the first time, we test the scalability of Astronomaly by applying it to almost 4 million images of galaxies from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We use a trained deep learning algorithm to learn useful representations of the images and pass these to the anomaly detection algorithm isolation forest, coupled with Astronomaly's active learning method, to discover interesting sources. We find that data selection criteria have a significant impact on the trade-off between finding rare sources such as strong lenses and introducing artefacts into the dataset. We demonstrate that active learning is required to identify the most interesting sources and reduce artefacts, while anomaly detection methods alone are insufficient. Using Astronomaly, we find 1635 anomalies among the top 2000 sources in the dataset after applying active learning, including eight strong gravitational lens candidates, 1609 galaxy merger candidates, and 18 previously unidentified sources exhibiting highly unusual morphology. Our results show that by leveraging the human-machine interface, Astronomaly is able to rapidly identify sources of scientific interest even in large datasets.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

      <title>FLUID: A rocket-borne pathfinder instrument for high efficiency UV band selection imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Far- and Lyman-Ultraviolet Imaging Demonstrator (FLUID) is a rocket-borne arcsecond-level ultraviolet (UV) imaging instrument covering four bands between 92 -- 193 nm. FLUID will observe nearby galaxies to find and characterize the most massive stars that are the the primary drivers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies, and the co-evolution of the surrounding galactic environment. The FLUID short wave channel is designed to suppress efficiency at Lyman-$\alpha$ (121.6 nm), while enhancing the reflectivity of shorter wavelengths. Utilizing this technology, FLUID will take the first ever images of local galaxies isolated in the Lyman ultraviolet (90 -- 120 nm). As a pathfinder instrument, FLUID will employ and increase the TRL of band-selecting UV coatings, and solar-blind UV detector technologies including microchannel plate and solid state detectors; technologies prioritized in the 2022 NASA Astrophysical Biennial Technology Report. These technologies enable high throughput and high sensitivity observations in the four co-aligned UV imaging bands that make up the FLUID instrument. We present the design of FLUID, status on the technology development, and results from initial assembly and calibration of the FLUID instrument.</description>

      <title>Three regimes of black hole feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In theoretical models of galaxy evolution, black hole feedback is a necessary ingredient in order to explain the observed exponential decline in number density of massive galaxies. Most contemporary black hole feedback models in cosmological simulations rely on a constant radiative efficiency (usually $\eta \sim 0.1$) at all black hole accretion rates. We present a synthesis model for the spin-dependent radiative efficiencies of three physical accretion rate regimes, i.e. $\eta = \eta(j, \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc})$, for use in large-volume cosmological simulations. The three regimes include: an advection dominated accretion flow ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &lt; 0.03\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$), a quasar-like mode ($0.03 &lt; \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 0.3$), and a slim disc mode ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &gt; 0.3\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$). Additionally, we include a large-scale powerful jet at low accretion rates. The black hole feedback model we present is a kinetic model that prescribes mass loadings but could be used in thermal models directly using the radiative efficiency. We implemented our model into the \texttt{Simba} galaxy evolution model to determine if it is possible to reproduce galaxy populations successfully, and provide a first calibration for further study. Using a $2\times512^3$ particle cosmological simulation in a $(75\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume, we found that the model is successful in reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function, black hole mass-stellar mass relationship, and stellar mass-halo mass relationship. Moving forward, this model opens new avenues for exploration of the impact of black hole feedback on galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Spectral Inverse Modelling with Simulation-Based Inference: An Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kilonovae represent a category of astrophysical transients, identifiable as the electromagnetic observable counterparts associated with the coalescence events of binary systems comprising neutron stars and neutron star-black hole pairs. They act as probes for heavy-element nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments. These studies rely on inference of the physical parameters (e.g., ejecta mass, velocity, composition) that describe kilonovae based on electromagnetic observations. This is a complex inverse problem typically addressed with sampling-based methods such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or nested sampling algorithms. However, repeated inferences can be computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of these methods. This poses a significant challenge to ensuring the reliability and statistical validity of the posterior approximations and, thus, the inferred kilonova parameters themselves. We present a novel approach: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) using simulations produced by KilonovaNet. Our method employs an ensemble of Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (ANPE) with an embedding network to directly predict posterior distributions from simulated spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We take advantage of the quasi-instantaneous inference time of ANPE to demonstrate the reliability of our posterior approximations using diagnostics tools, including coverage diagnostic and posterior predictive checks. We further test our model with real observations from AT2017gfo, the only kilonova with multi-messenger data, demonstrating agreement with previous likelihood-based methods while reducing inference time down to a few seconds. The inference results produced by ANPE appear to be conservative and reliable, paving the way for testable and more efficient kilonova parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Astronomy potential of KM3NeT/ARCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km$^3$, to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources and an all-sky diffuse neutrino flux. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. By leveraging both the track and shower observation channels, the KM3NeT/ARCA detector demonstrates the capability to detect the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux within half a year of operation, achieving a 5$\sigma$ statistical significance. With an angular resolution below 0.1$^\circ$ for tracks and under 2$^\circ$ for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>

Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>
