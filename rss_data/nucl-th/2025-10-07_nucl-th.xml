      <title>Semiclassical treatment of bottomonium suppression and regeneration in $p+{\rm Pb}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bottomonium suppression in $p+ {\rm Pb}$ relative to $p+p$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 5.02$ and 8.16~TeV. Specifically, we combine cold nuclear matter effects (nuclear modifications of the parton densities, energy loss and momentum broadening) with those from hot nuclear matter (suppression and regeneration) by implementing the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in hydrodynamic simulations. Bottomonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma is evaluated semiclassically, employing two different reaction rates. The first includes quasi-free inelastic scattering and gluo-dissociation employing a perturbative coupling to the medium. The second is based on in-medium $T$-matrix calculations where the input potential is constrained by lattice quantum chromodynamics to extract the bottomonium masses and dissociation rates. These semiclassical results are compared to previous calculations in an open quantum systems approach and to the experimental data. Predictions for $\chi_b$ suppression at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$~TeV are also presented.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration that Quark-Gluon Plasma has a Nonzero Resolution Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on our investigation in arXiv:2509.08881 of how recent jet substructure measurements constrain the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. $L_{\rm res}$ is defined such that high-energy partons within a jet shower are resolved by the medium if and only if they are separated by a distance greater than $L_{\rm res}$. Using the Hybrid Model, we reproduce ALICE data on the scaled Soft Drop angle $\theta_g$ for $R=0.2$ charged-particle jets and ATLAS data on the Hard Group angle $\Delta R_{12}$ for $R=1$ jets reclustered from skinny $R = 0.2$ inclusive subjets. We find that the narrowing of the $\theta_g$-distribution in PbPb collisions observed by ALICE and the suppression of $R=1$ jets with multiple skinny subjets in PbPb collisions observed by ATLAS rule out $L_{\rm res} = \infty$, where each entire parton shower loses energy to the plasma coherently as if it were a single colored object. We then compare Hybrid Model calculations to ATLAS measurements of $R_{\rm AA}$ of $R=1$ jets reclustered from $R=0.2$ subjets, as a function of the Soft Drop angle $dR_{12}$ obtained by grooming all charged-particle tracks associated with each $R=1$ jet. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the ATLAS data is inconsistent with $L_{\rm res} = 0$, where the plasma resolves every splitting in a parton shower. Our results agree best with the data when QGP possesses a finite, nonzero $L_{\rm res}\sim (1-2)/(\pi T)$.</description>

      <title>Effects of hadronic molecule $N(2080)3/2^-$ on $K^{*+}\Lambda$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 101}, 014003 (2020)], we have analyzed all available data on differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements for the $\gamma p \to K^{\ast +} \Lambda$ reaction using an effective Lagrangian approach. There, the $t$-channel $K$, $K^*$, and $\kappa$ exchanges, the $u$-channel $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and $\Sigma^*$ exchanges, the $s$-channel $N$, $N(2060)5/2^-$, and $N(2000)5/2^+$ exchanges, and the interaction current were taken into account in constructing the reaction amplitudes. It was found that, overall, the agreement of the theoretical results with the corresponding data is fairly good. However, noticeable discrepancies between the model results and the data on spin density matrix elements $\rho_{00}$ are still observed in the center-of-mass energy region around $W \approx 2.08$ GeV, indicating the need for additional reaction mechanisms. On the other hand, the hidden-strange pentaquark-like state $N(2080)3/2^-$, which is proposed to be a $K^*\Sigma$ molecular state as the strange partner of $P_c(4457)$ hadronic molecule, has been found to play quite active roles in reproducing the data for $K^{*+}\Sigma^0$, $K^{*0}\Sigma^+$, and $\phi p$ photoproduction reactions. Based on these observations, in the present work, we reanalyze the data for the $\gamma p \to K^{\ast +} \Lambda$ reaction by incorporating the pentaquark-like state $N(2080)3/2^-$ in our previously proposed model. The results show that with the inclusion of the contributions of $N(2080)3/2^-$, the quality of the theoretical description of the $\gamma p \to K^{*+}\Lambda$ data can be considerably improved.</description>

      <title>Proton Pandemonium: A first look at the $^{31}$Cl($\beta p \gamma$)$^{30}$P decay scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron decays of proton-rich nuclides exhibit large $Q$ values, producing complex cascades which often involve various radiations, including protons and $\gamma$ rays. Often, only one of the two are measured in a single experiment, limiting the accuracy and completeness of the decay scheme. An example is $^{31}$Cl, for which protons and $\gamma$ rays have been measured in detail individually but never with substantial sensitivity to proton-$\gamma$ coincidences. The purpose of this work is to provide detailed measurements of $^{31}$Cl $\beta$-delayed proton decay including $\beta$-$p$-$\gamma$ sequences, extract spectroscopic information on $^{31}$S excited states as well as their $\beta$ feeding, and compare to shell-model calculations. A fast, fragmented beam of $^{31}$Cl provided was deposited in the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) system. GADGET's gas-filled Proton Detector was used to detect $beta$-delayed protons, and the Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) was used to detect $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ rays. Up to 18 previously unobserved $\beta$-delayed proton transitions have been discovered, most of which populate excited states of $^{30}$P. Here present the first detailed $^{31}$Cl($\beta p \gamma$)$^{30}$P decay scheme and find improved agreement with theoretical calculations of the Gamow-Teller strength distribution for $^{31}$S excitation energies $7.5 &lt; E_x &lt; 9.5$ MeV. The present work demonstrates that the capability to detect $\beta$-delayed protons and $\gamma$ rays in coincidence is essential to construct accurate positron decay schemes for comparison to theoretical nuclear structure calculations. In some respects, this phenomenon for $\beta$-delayed protons resembles the pandemonium effect originally introduced for $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ rays.</description>

Abstract: A proper description of the non-equilibrium matter preceding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions and its observable consequences remain a major theoretical challenge, while at the same time offering new opportunities for experimental exploration. In these proceedings, I provide an overview of studies presented in talks and posters at Quark Matter 2025 on this topic. We will focus on the latest developments regarding the features and the numerical description of the non-equilibrium pre-QGP matter, as well as the potential to use hard probes as a means to study the hydrodynamization dynamics of the QCD plasma.</description>

      <title>Barnett effect as a new source of magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barnett effect is a fundamental magnetomechanical phenomenon in which a ferromagnetic material becomes magnetized under rotation. Using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) model under rigid rotation, we compute the Barnett magnetization ($M_{\rm Barnett}$) and show that it produces a magnetic field ($B_{\text{ind}}$) comparable in magnitude to the well-known external field ($B_{\text{ext}}$) from spectator protons at low energy heavy-ion collisions. This finding establishes the Barnett effect as a previously overlooked but essential source of magnetization and magnetic field in the heavy-ion collisions, with profound implications for understanding spin dynamics and anomalous transport in quantum chromodynamics under extreme rotation.</description>

      <title>Valence $1s-0d$ proton vacancy of the $^{32}$Si ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{32}$Si($^3$He,$d$)$^{33}$P reaction was studied in inverse kinematics at 6.3~MeV/$u$. States in $^{33}$P corresponding to the proton $1s-0d$ single-particle orbitals were identified up to $\sim$4.5 MeV in excitation energy. The ($^{3}$He,$d$) spectroscopic factors were determined from Distorted Wave Born Approximation calculations. When combined with complementary neutron-adding data, the $1s-0d$ proton vacancies in the $^{32}$Si ground state were extracted. In conjunction with a re-analysis of data from previous single-particle measurements, the trends in proton and neutron vacancy were explored across the $^{28,30,32,34}$Si isotopes. Both proton and neutron vacancy data show gradual changes in their occupancies. The proton $1s_{1/2}$ orbitals in $^{32}$Si and $^{34}$Si are both consistent with being empty. The ground-state nucleon distributions are described by shell-model calculations constrained to the $1s-0d$ model space.</description>

      <title>Firewall boundaries and mixed phases of rotating quark matter in linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rigidly-rotating body in unbounded space is usually considered a pathological system since it leads to faster-than-light velocities and associated breaches of causality. However, numerical results on chiral symmetry breaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close correspondence in predictions between the rigorous bounded and formal unbounded approaches. To provide insight into this correlation, we consider the linear sigma model coupled to quarks, undergoing rigid rotation in unbounded Minkowski space-time. Within the mean-field approach, we adopt three consecutive levels of approximation to the ground state of the system that feature uniform (model 1), weakly inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneous (model 3) condensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of the condensate show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. Model 3 exhibits a deviation from the Tolman-Ehrenfest prediction due to the appearance of a new energy scale set by the inhomogeneity of the ground state. Its boundary conditions are fixed by imposing regularity at the rotation axis and by demanding the global minimization of the grand potential. We dub the latter as ``firewall boundary conditions,'' translating into the requirement of vanishing condensate on the light cylinder, which follows from the fact that the system state formally diverges at the light cylinder. In all models, we present the phase diagram of the system and point out that in models 2 and 3, the system resides either in a chirally-restored phase, or in a mixed phase that possesses spatially-separated chirally-restored and chirally-broken phases. Finally, we discuss the properties of the system under inhomogeneous rotation using the relativistic version of the Rankine vortex model.</description>

      <title>Composition of scalar mesons and their effects on nuclear matter properties in an extended linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that the iso-scalar and iso-vector mesons play significant roles in nuclear matter and neutron star structures. We improve the extended linear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing the flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral representations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is refined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by the lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as $f_\pi \approx 134 \, \text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of the symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial for the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of $\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using several parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at saturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron star structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$ meson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both are favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor larger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies the statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining realistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The parameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of the sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores of massive stars. It is hoped that the results of this work can guide future studies on the relationship between the microscopic symmetry of strong interactions and macroscopic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fluid behavior in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$ with viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The applicability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems remains controversial due to the small size and short lifetime of the system. In this letter, we employ viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH), which incorporates large pressure anisotropies, to study the collectivity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$.VAH provides a good description for $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ over a wide range of multiplicities and correctly reproduces the experimentally observed negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. Traditional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH), on the other hand, can describe the measurements, in particular the negative $c_{2}\{4\}$, only with model parameters for which the bulk of the evolution is characterized by large values of the shear Knudsen number. It also can not capture the large longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy during the early evolution. These demonstrate the failure of traditional viscous hydrodynamics in small collision systems and establish viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics as a more reliable framework to describe the bulk evolution and the observed anisotropic flow in p-p collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive view of nuclear shapes, rotations and vibrations from fully quantum mechanical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear quadrupole collective states at low excitation energies are described in a novel, fully quantum mechanical and systematic manner as compared to traditional pictures initiated by Aage Bohr. The ellipsoidal shapes are shown to be triaxial in virtually all strongly deformed nuclei, in contrast to the Ansatz of axially symmetric shapes. The rotational bands of such triaxially deformed nuclei are described in a fully quantum mechanical way, i. e., without resorting to quantized free rotation of rigid body. The excitation energies within a rotational band, exhibiting the $J(J+1)$ dependence on angular momentum $J$, are shown to basically represent the change of binding energies due to nuclear forces. This differs from the interpretation \'a la Aage Bohr as rotational kinetic energies. The $K$ quantum numbers are shown to be practically conserved for triaxial ellipsoids, which turned out to be a real but positive surprise to many people in the field. The so-called $\gamma$ bands are shown to be $K$=2$^+$ rotations rather than $\gamma$-vibrations, leading to a nice description of the so-called $\gamma\gamma$ 4$^+$ state as a $K$=4$^+$ rotation. Vibrational modes are also shown to emerge in this study. Thus, the whole picture of low-energy quadrupole collective motion of heavy nuclei has been renewed in a fully quantum mechanical fashion, which differs from the traditional picture but appears to be simpler and more natural.</description>

      <title>Properties of hyperons in nuclear matter from chiral hyperon-nucleon interactions at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ single-particle potentials in infinite nuclear matter are analyzed within a recently established chiral hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) interaction up to N$^2$LO in combination with an nucleon-nucleon interaction derived in the same scheme. The self-consistent Brueckner-Hartree-Fock method with the continuous choice of the single-particle potential is employed. It is found that the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential is comparable to the results achieved with the NLO $YN$ interaction from 2019. The resulting $\Sigma$ potential becomes more attractive compared to the previous NLO results due to the constraint from the recent $\Sigma N$ differential cross section data measured in the J-PARC E40 experiment. An estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the single-particle potentials is provided in terms of the truncation error in the chiral expansion.</description>

      <title>Leptodermic corrections to the TOV equations and nuclear astrophysics within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium
  is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account the gradient terms
  responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case
  are found with these surface corrections to the known leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation
  $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius.
  The energy density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number
  density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational component $\Phi(\rho)$ of the energy density
  is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where
  $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density, up to second order, in terms of its contributions to the
  separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the
  normal direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was
  used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations by accounting for their NS surface corrections.
  The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard
  TOV approach of the zero order.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Polarized tau decay and CP violation in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of $\tau$-lepton polarization in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) as a novel application of the intense electromagnetic fields generated in such processes. In particular, we analyze the decay distributions of polarized $\tau$-leptons produced via photon-photon fusion, focusing on both leptonic and semi-leptonic channels. We show that the external magnetic field present in UPCs induces a preferred spin quantization axis, which modifies the angular and energy distributions of $\tau$ decay products relative to the standard helicity frame. By formulating the spin polarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified polarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can retain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging. Furthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay products, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects. This framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC and future colliders to exploit polarized $\tau$ decays in UPCs as an application of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them. Within a fermionic DM model that interacts only through gravitation, along with a well-constrained nuclear matter equation of state, we show that the simultaneous mass and radius measurement of PSRJ0740+6620 reduces the uncertainty of DM central energy density by more than 50\% compared to the results obtained from using the two observables independently, while other DM parameters remain unconstrained. Additionally, we find that the DM fraction $f_D$ should be smaller than 2\% when constrained by the observed NS maximum mass alone, and it could be even smaller than 0.3\% with the simultaneous measurement of mass and radius, supporting the conclusion that only a small amount of DM exists in DM admixed neutron stars (DANS).</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is
  $b_F$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume formalism for $N\pi\pi$ at maximal isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N \pi \pi$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the $\Delta$ resonance in the $N\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and $1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\pi$ states, and we do not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\pi$ states cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\pi$ scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering using the three-particle $DD\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\pi\pi \leftrightarrow N\pi$ systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\pi\pi$ amplitudes arising from $N\pi\pi\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.</description>
