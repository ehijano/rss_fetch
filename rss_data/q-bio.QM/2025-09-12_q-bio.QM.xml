      <title>Virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology of bone implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>bioSBM: a random graph model to integrate epigenomic data in chromatin structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus plays a crucial role in gene expression and genome function. However, the quantitative relationship between this organization and nuclear biochemical processes remains under debate. In this study, we present a graph-based generative model, bioSBM, designed to capture long-range chromatin interaction patterns from Hi-C data and, importantly, simultaneously link these patterns to biochemical features. Applying bioSBM to Hi-C maps of the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line, we identified a latent structure of chromatin interactions, revealing 7 distinct communities that strongly align with known biological annotations. Additionally, we infer a linear transformation that maps biochemical observables, such as histone marks, to the parameters of the generative graph model, enabling accurate genome-wide predictions of chromatin contact maps on out-of-sample data, both within the same cell line, and on the completely unseen HCT116 cell line under RAD21 depletion. These findings highlight bioSBM's potential as a powerful tool for elucidating the relationship between biochemistry and chromatin architecture and predicting long-range genome organization from independent biochemical data.</description>

      <title>Derivation from kinetic theory and 2-D pattern analysis of chemotaxis models for Multiple Sclerosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of reaction-diffusion equations for Multiple Sclerosis is presented. These models are derived by means of a diffusive limit starting from a proper kinetic description, taking account of the underlying microscopic interactions among cells. At the macroscopic level, we discuss the necessary conditions for Turing instability phenomena and the formation of two-dimensional patterns, whose shape and stability are investigated by means of a weakly nonlinear analysis. Some numerical simulations, confirming and extending theoretical results, are proposed for a specific scenario.</description>
