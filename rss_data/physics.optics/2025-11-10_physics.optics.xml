      <title>Joint control of coherent transmission, reflection, and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling multiple wave properties simultaneously poses a key challenge in coherent control of wave transport. We present a theory for joint coherent control of transmission, reflection, and absorption in linear systems. We prove that the numerical range provides the mathematical structure governing achievable responses, and reveal non-abelian effects due to non-commutativity between transmission, reflection, and absorption matrices. We provide an algorithm to achieve arbitrary target responses. Our results establish a theoretical foundation for joint coherent control of waves.</description>

      <title>Extend the waveband of high isolation ratio and narrow band asymmetric transmission based on grating-film-grating nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A serial asymmetric transmission (AT) nanodevices based on the grating-film-grating (G-F-G) structure are proposed and studied. By showing the results of three different nanodevices as examples, it is proved that this kind of G-F-G nanostructure can achieve high isolation ratio AT at arbitrary wavelength within a certain range by designing the parameters of the structure. These three nanodevices can achieve high forward transmittivities of 0.69, 0.71, and 0.87 at the wavelengths of 714, 810, and 905 nm, respectively, and the isolation ratio between forward and backward transmittivities are all more than 10 dB. In addition, the effects of the incidence angle and lateral displacement of upper gratings on device performance were also investigated, revealing that optimal AT is achieved under normal incidence and zero displacement. The proposed G-F-G structure provides a solution for passive and easy to manufacture optical isolators with potential applications in optical communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive tip-enhanced sum frequency generation spectroscopy using temporally asymmetric pulse for detecting weak vibrational signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating molecular structures, orientations, and dynamics at surfaces. However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the micrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) using a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this limitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from vibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant background (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making the second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay between the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed, which in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and facilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also made the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute molecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals were simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals originated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally, the signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\times 10^6-1.3\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive TE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the investigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Quasi-bound flat bands in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are widely known spatially localized states experimentally implemented as quasi-BICs. Although they emerged as a promising solution for achieving high-quality resonances in photonic structures, quasi-BICs are confined to a very narrow range in k-space and are highly sensitive to disorder. Here, we introduce quasi-bound flat bands in the continuum (quasi-BFICs), a class of optical states where Bloch modes are found within a photonic flat band, leading to a quasi-BIC behaviour at every k-point above the light line. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the origin of quasi-BFICs from the disorder-induced band folding, mode localization and multiple topological charges in k-space, and identify the optimal strength of structural disorder to maximise their generation probability. Angle-resolved transmission and Q-factor measurements confirm the existence of quasi-BFICs, opening new avenues for designing devices with high quality factor and wide-angle response, presenting a counterintuitive strategy that leverages disorder to enhance optical performance.</description>

      <title>Annular Channel Eigenmodes: A Physical-Layer Approach to Suppressing OAM Modal Crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal crosstalk is a fundamental limitation for orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based spatial-division multiplexing. Here, we introduce Annular Channel Eigenmodes (ACEs) - rigorously derived as the optimal band-limited solution for maximizing energy concentration within distinct annular channels. This approach reformulates the design as a Hermitian eigenvalue problem, efficiently yielding optimal beams that are physically isolated in space. Numerical simulations demonstrate that under identical conditions, conventional Gaussian-enveloped perfect optical vortices (POVs) exhibit an average modal crosstalk of -16 dB, whereas ACEs suppress crosstalk to nearly -30 dB. Moreover, the crosstalk suppression of ACEs continues to improve exponentially with increasing channel width, while that of POVs saturates at a fundamental limit. We experimentally generated ACEs and confirmed a 36% enhancement in energy confinement relative to POVs. ACEs thus provide a physically robust basis for high-fidelity, high-density OAM communications.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Paraxial Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work unveils a novel and fundamental connection between structured light and topological field theory by showing how the natural geometrical setting for paraxial vector beams is that of a $SU(2)$ principal bundle over $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. Going beyond the usual high-order Poincar\'e sphere approach, we show how the nonseparable structure of polarisation and spatial modes in vector beams is naturally described by a non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory. In this framework, we link the Chern-Simons charge to spin-orbit coupling, and we propose a simple way to experimentally detect the presence of non-Abelian phases through Wilson lines. This new insight on vector beams opens new possibilities for realising and probing topological quantum field theories using classical optics, as well as it lays the foundation for implementing topologically protected classical and quantum information protocols with structured light.</description>

      <title>Resonantly Pumped Tunable Tm,X:CaF2 Lasers: Effect of Buffer Ions (X = Y, La, Gd, and Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the eye-safe laser performance of Tm3+-doped calcium fluoride crystals, modified with optically inactive "buffer" cations (Y3+, Lu3+, Gd3+, and La3+), under in-band diode-pumping at 1.68 um. In the free-running regime, the 1.5 at.% Tm, 4 at.% Y:CaF2 laser operates with a high slope efficiency of 47% with respect to absorbed pump power. By employing an MgF2 birefringent plate, the emission wavelength of this laser is continuously tuned over 242 nm (1820 - 2062 nm) highlighting its potential for broadly tunable and ultrafast oscillators. The spectroscopic properties of Tm3+ ions in CaF2 crystals with and without buffer ions are also compared.</description>

      <title>Galvanometer-scanning transient phase microscopy with balanced detection and arbitrary pump polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient absorption microscopy measures excited-state kinetics based on the imaginary part of the pump-induced perturbation to the complex refractive index, i.e. $\Im \{\Delta\mathcal N\}$, with applications in both materials and biomedical sciences. Its complement, transient phase microscopy, enabled by stable inline birefringent interferometry, measures the real part $\Re\{\Delta \mathcal N\}$. The ability to switch between absorption and phase measurements may yield a stronger signal, depending on the sample and probe wavelength. To date, however, transient phase has not been coupled with galvanometer scanners, thus limiting it to materials science applications and non-imaging spectroscopy. Here, we extend transient phase microscopy to operate in a fast galvanometer-scanning microscope with balanced detection, comparing amplitude and phase measurements in graphene, hemoglobin, and red blood cells. We examine the impacts and limitations introduced by galvanometer scanning, in addition to relocation of the pump-probe combining dichroic to permit arbitrary polarization of the pump.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Ptychoscopy: A Ptychographic Framework for Nuclear Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessing both amplitude and phase of nuclear response functions is central to fully characterizing light-matter interactions in the X-ray-nuclear regime. Recent work has demonstrated phase retrieval in two-dimensional time- and energy-resolved spectra, establishing the feasibility of phase-sensitive nuclear spectroscopy. Here, we introduce Nuclear Ptychoscopy, a ptychographic framework that adapts algorithms from coherent diffractive imaging to nuclear spectroscopy, enabling reconstruction of the complex response function by exploiting redundancy in two-dimensional spectra. We develop three complementary reconstruction schemes tailored to distinct experimental scenarios: reconstruction with a known analyzer response, blind reconstruction, and reconstruction incorporating partial prior information. In parallel, we develop geometric analysis techniques that elucidate algorithmic behavior and contribute new tools to ptychography. The framework is validated through experimental data and simulations, demonstrating its versatility across diverse nuclear spectroscopy scenarios and bridging nuclear spectroscopy with ptychography. Beyond advancing quantitative nuclear spectroscopy, our framework opens new opportunities for metrology, coherent control, and quantum applications in the X-ray-nuclear regime.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel scheme for coherent manipulation of populations and robust creation of arbitrary coherent superposition of metastable states of a quantum system with lambda configuration of operating energy levels using laser pulses with a quadratically chirped carrier frequency. The case of a single broadband laser pulse is considered, when the frequency spectrum of the pulse exceeds the frequency distance between the metastable energy levels of the system. The results of the dressed state analysis and numerical simulation are presented, demonstrating reliable and robust creation of an arbitrary coherent superposition of metastable states by changing the parameters of laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Optimizing broadband microwave absorbers for applications in the 70-200 GHz range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results of an extensive suite of numerical simulations that probe square-tiled microwave absorber performance as a function of material properties, frequency, geometry, and unit cell size. The work, which probes both specular reflection and total absorption, highlights the critical importance of the absorber scale size relative to the incidence wavelength while suggesting that material properties have a comparatively weaker impact on overall performance. We show that some absorber designs can achieve 99.5-99.9% frequency-averaged absorption across the 70 to 200 GHz range for normal incidence and that low specular reflectance does not necessarily guarantee optimal absorption performance. Our results indicate that exponential, Klopfenstein, and linear impedance tapers provide comparable performance as long as a unit cell size of 1 to 4 mm is chosen. Simulation results are validated against measurements of specular reflectance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the absorption of light in a bulk homogeneous semiconductor produces photocarriers with non-zero momentum, it generally does not produce a current in the absence of an applied electric field because equal amounts of carriers with opposite momentum are injected. The interference of absorption processes, for example, between one-photon and two-photon absorption, can produce a current because constructive interference for carriers with one momentum can correspond to destructive interference for carriers with the opposite momentum. We show that for the interference between two-photon and three-photon absorption, the current has a narrower angular spread, i.e., a ``beam'' of electrons in a specified direction is produced in the semiconductor.</description>

Abstract: We report on the realization of an optical microcavity consisting in the plane-plane arrangement of two suspended resonant mirrors possessing spectrally overlapping high-quality factor internal resonances. We first investigate its generic transmission spectra as the cavity length is varied on the basis of a simple linear Fabry-Perot model, compare them with those of broadband mirror cavities or Fano cavities possessing a single resoannt mirror, and then present an experimental realization using a pair of highly pretensioned, ultrathin silicon nitride films patterned with one-dimensional photonic crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Advanced micropillar cavities: room-temperature operation of microlasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality micropillar cavities were grown using molecular-beam epitaxy. Stable continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature was demonstrated for microlasers with semiconductor and hybrid output mirrors. At 300 K, single-mode lasing was demonstrated for micropillars with a diameter of 5 $\mu$m at a wavelength of 960 nm, with a minimum lasing threshold of 1.2 mW and a bare quality-factor exceeding 8000.</description>

      <title>Single-shot near-field reconstruction of metamaterial dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a single-shot near-field technique to reconstruct the isofrequency surfaces of metamaterials in the microwave regime. In our approach, we excite resonant modes using a fixed source in a resonator composed of the material under test and map the in-plane field distribution with a movable probe. Applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the measured field reveals the sample's in-plane dispersion. By extending this analysis over multiple frequencies and comparing the results with Fabry-P\'erot resonances, we retrieve the full three-dimensional dispersion relation. When we apply the method to a double non-connected wire metamaterial, it accurately captures the low-frequency hyperbolic isofrequency surface, providing both a precise experimental tool and conceptual insight into spatially dispersive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we numerically show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. This claim is further supported by analytical effective-medium theory and by numerical estimates of scattering mean-free paths. Finally, we introduce ``polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable spatio-spectral quantum networks in nonlinear photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplexing information in different degrees of freedom and use of integrated and fiber-optic components are natural solutions to the scalability bottleneck in optical quantum communications and computing. However, for bulk-optics systems, where size, cost, stability, and reliability are factors, this remains either impractical or highly challenging to implement. In this paper we present a framework to engineer continuous-variable entanglement produced through nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion in \chi^(2) nonlinear photonic lattices in spatial and spectral degrees of freedom that can solve the scalability challenge. We show how spatio-spectral pump shaping produce cluster states that are naturally distributable in quantum communication networks and a resource for measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Virus Spreading in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum communication have enabled long-distance secure information transfer through quantum channels, giving rise to quantum networks with unique physical and statistical properties. However, as in classical networks, the propagation of viruses in these systems could have severe consequences. Here, we investigate the critical problem of virus spreading in quantum networks. We develop quantitative tools, particularly a modified nonlinear dynamical system model, for performing epidemiological analyses on quantum networks. Our results show that quantum networks tend to be more resilient to viral infections, exhibiting higher epidemic thresholds than classical networks with identical graph topologies. This apparent robustness, however, arises primarily from the sparser connectivity inherent to the quantum networks. When the comparison is made at a fixed average connectivity, classical and quantum networks display comparable epidemic thresholds. These findings provide key insights into the security and reliability of future large-scale quantum communication systems. Our work bridges the fields of quantum information science, network theory, and epidemiology, paving the way for future studies of quantum epidemiological dynamics.</description>
