      <title>consexpressionR: an R package for consensus differential gene expression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Bulk RNA-Seq is a widely used method for studying gene expression across a variety of contexts. The significance of RNA-Seq studies has grown with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Computational methods have been developed for each stage of the identification of differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, there are few studies exploring the association between different types of methods. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the association of methodologies in the results of differential expression analysis. By adopting two data sets with qPCR data (to gold-standard reference), seven methods were implemented and assessed in R packages (EBSeq, edgeR, DESeq2, limma, SAMseq, NOISeq, and Knowseq), which was performed and assessed separately and in association. The results were evaluated considering the adopted qPCR data. Results: Here, we introduce consexpressionR, an R package that automates differential expression analysis using consensus of at least seven methodologies, producing more assertive results with a significant reduction in false positives. Availability: consexpressionR is an R package available via source code and support are available at GitHub (https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpressionR).</description>

      <title>GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis in Alignment with Bioinformaticians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets. However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort, limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.</description>
