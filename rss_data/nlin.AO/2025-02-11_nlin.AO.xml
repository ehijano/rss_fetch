      <title>Breakdown of stochastic resonance in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06626</link>

Abstract: In networked systems, stochastic resonance occurs as a collective phenomenon where the entire stochastic network resonates with a weak applied periodic signal. Beyond the interplay among the network coupling, the amplitude of the external periodic signal, and the intensity of stochastic fluctuations, the maintenance of stochastic resonance also crucially depends on the resonance capacity of each oscillator composing the network. This scenario raises the question: Can local defects in the ability of oscillators to resonate break down the stochastic resonance phenomenon in the entire network? Here, we investigate this possibility in complex networks of prototypical bistable oscillators in a double-well potential. We test the sustainability of stochastic resonance by considering a fraction of network oscillators with nonresonant potential landscapes. We find that the number of nonresonant oscillators depends nonlinearly on their dissimilarity from the rest of the network oscillators. In addition, we unravel the role of the network topology and coupling strength in maintaining, or suppressing, the stochastic resonance for different noise levels and number of nonresonant oscillators. Finally, we obtain a low-dimensional deterministic model confirming the results observed for the networks.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and its slow decay in noisy oscillators with simplicial interactions</title>

Abstract: Previous studies on oscillator populations with two-simplex interaction have reported novel phenomena such as discontinuous desynchronization transitions and multistability of synchronized states. However, the noise effect is not well understood. Here, we study a higher-order network of noisy oscillators with generic interactions consisting of one-simplex and two types of two-simplex interactions. We observe that when a type of two-simplex interaction is dominant, synchrony is eroded and eventually disappears even for infinitesimally weak noise. Nevertheless, synchronized states may persist for extended periods, with the lifetime increasing approximately exponentially with the strength of the two-simplex interaction. When one-simplex or another type of two-simplex interaction is sufficiently strong, noise erosion is prevented, and synchronized states become persistent. A weakly nonlinear analysis reveals that as one-simplex coupling increases, the synchronized state appears supercritically or subscritically, depending on the interaction strength. Furthermore, assuming weak noise and using Kramers' rate theory, we derive a closed dynamical equation for the Kuramoto order parameter, from which the time scale of the erosion process is derived. Our study elucidates the synchronization and desynchronization of oscillator assemblies in higher-order networks and is expected to provide insights into such systems' design and control principles.</description>
