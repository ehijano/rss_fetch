      <title>Weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and variable exponent Morrey regularity for fully nonlinear parabolic PDEs with oblique boundary conditions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we establish global weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and variable exponent Morrey-Sobolev estimates for viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear parabolic equations subject to oblique boundary conditions on a portion of the boundary, within the following framework: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{rclcl} F(D^2u,Du,u,x,t) - u_{t} &amp;=&amp; f(x,t) &amp; \text{in} &amp; \Omega_{\mathrm{T}}, \\ \beta \cdot Du + \gamma u &amp;=&amp; g(x,t) &amp; \text{on} &amp; \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{T}}, \\ u(x, 0) &amp;=&amp; 0 &amp; \text{on} &amp; \Omega_{0}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*}
  where \(\Omega_{\mathrm{T}} = \Omega \times (0,\mathrm{T})\) denotes the parabolic cylinder with spatial base \(\Omega\) (a bounded domain in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(n \geq 2\)) and temporal height \(\mathrm{T} &gt; 0\), \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{T}} = \partial \Omega \times (0,\mathrm{T})\), and \(\Omega_{0} = \Omega \times \{0\}\). Additionally, \(f\) represents the source term of the parabolic equation, while the boundary data are given by \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), and \(g\). Our first main result is a global weighted Orlicz-Sobolev estimate for the solution, obtained under asymptotic structural conditions on the differential operator and appropriate assumptions on the boundary data, assuming that the source term belongs to the corresponding weighted Orlicz space. Leveraging these estimates, we demonstrate several applications, including a density result within the fundamental class of parabolic equations, regularity results for the related obstacle problem, and weighted Orlicz-BMO estimates for both the Hessian and the time derivative of the solution. Lastly, we derive variable exponent Morrey-Sobolev estimates for the problem via an extrapolation technique, which are of independent mathematical interest.</description>

      <title>Spectral inequalities for Schr\"odinger equations and quantitative propagation of smallness in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with spectral inequalities for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with potentials bounded between two increasing functions (weights). The spectral inequality allows one to estimate the norm of a function with bounded spectrum by its values on a certain sensor set. We say that a measurable subset of the real line is thick if the measure of the intersection of this set with any interval of fixed length is bounded from below. First, we consider thick sensor sets a large class of pairs of weights. For potentials constrained between two polynomials, spectral inequalities for a broad class of so-called generalized thick sets are analyzed. A quantitative dependence of the constants in the spectral inequalities on the density of the sensor sets, the growth rate of the potentials, and the spectral interval is established. The proofs rely on a new quantitative propagation of smallness (or quantitative Cauchy uniqueness) for elliptic equations in the plane.</description>

      <title>A piezoelectric beam model with nonlinear interior dampings and supercritical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate a three-dimensional fully magnetic effected piezoelectric beam model with strong sources and nonlinear interior dampings. By employing nonlinear semigroups and the theory of monotone operators, the existence of local weak solutions is established. By the potential well method, we obtain the global existence of potential well solutions. Decay rates of the total energy are obtained in terms of the behavior of the damping terms. The main advantage in this work is that the stabilization estimate does not generate lower-order terms, and in addition we remove some strong conditions in previous results to obtain a weaker energy decay. Finally, when the initial total energy is negative, positive but small, respectively, the blow-up results for weak solutions if the source terms are stronger than damping terms are obtained according to the differential inequality technique. Moreover, if interior dampings are linear, a blow-up result with arbitrarily high initial energy is established by the concavity method and an upper bound for the blow-up time is also derived. All results are independent of any relation among the model coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the long-term behavior for the projected deterministic constrained modified Swift-Hohenberg equation with constraints and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Specifically, using Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality, we have shown that the global solution approaches an equilibrium state. Also, we have analyzed the rate at which the solution approaches equilibrium. Finally, we have proven the existence of a global attractor.</description>

      <title>Ground States of the Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta Vertex Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation set on a tadpole graph with a repulsive delta vertex condition between the loop and the tail of the tadpole. We establish the existence of an action ground state when the size of the loop is either very small or very large. Our analysis relies on variational arguments, such as profile decomposition. When it exists, we study the shape of the ground state using ordinary differential equations arguments, such as the study of period functions. The theoretical results are completed with a numerical study.</description>

      <title>Space-Time-Dependent Source Identification Problem for a Subdiffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a subdiffusion equation with a Caputo time derivative, where the right-hand side depends on both time and certain spatial variables. Similar inverse problems have been previously explored for hyperbolic and parabolic equations, with some studies establishing the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions, while others proved the uniqueness of classical solutions. However, such inverse problems for fractional-order equations have not been addressed prior to this work. Here, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the considered inverse problem. To solve it, we employ the Fourier method with respect to the variable independent of the unknown right-hand side, followed by the method of successive approximations to compute the Fourier coefficients of the solution. Notably, the results obtained are also novel for parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to 3D compressible MHD equations with partial magnetic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global existence of strong solutions to the compressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ remains a significant open problem. When there is no magnetic diffusion, even small data global well-posedness is unknown. This study investigates the Cauchy problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for the compressible viscous MHD equations with horizontal magnetic diffusion. Using various anisotropic Sobolev inequalities and sharp estimates, we establish the existence of global solutions under small initial data within the Sobolev space framework.</description>

      <title>On the long time behaviour of a system of several rigid bodies immersed in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several rigid bodies immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid contained in a bounded domain in $R^3$. We introduce a new concept of dissipative weak solution of the problem based on a combination of the approach proposed by Judakov with a suitable form of energy inequality. We show that global--in--time dissipative solutions always exist as long as the rigid bodies are connected compact sets. In addition, in the absence of external driving forces, the system always tends to a static equilibrium as time goes to infinity. The results hold independently of possible collisions of rigid bodies and for any finite energy initial data.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to the Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system in bounded Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the coupled Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes or the chemotaxis-consumption-Navier-Stokes system in bounded Lipschitz domains for general coupling terms which, e.g., include buoyancy forces. It is shown that these systems admit local strong as well as global strong solutions for small data in the setting of critical Besov spaces. Moreover, non-trivial equilibria are shown to be exponentially stable. For smoother data, these solutions are shown to be globally bounded and to preserve positivity properties. The approach presented is based on optimal $\mathrm{L}^q$-regularity properties of the Neumann Laplacian and the Stokes operator in bounded Lipschitz domains.</description>

      <title>Iterative methods fail to solve NLS below the Sobolev embedding threshold on the Sierpinski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the Sierpinski gasket with a power nonlinearity of order $2k{+}1$ is not locally well-posed for initial data just below the regularity threshold for the Sobolev embedding $H^s\subseteq L^\infty$. More precisely, the flow map fails to be $C^{2k+1}$-continuous in any Sobolev space $H^s$ below that threshold, and the threshold is independent of the power nonlinearity. This novel behavior significantly differs from other compact spaces such as the torus or the sphere, and it is directly connected to the existence of localized eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for finite energy solutions to the stationary 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove rigidity results for classical solutions to the stationary 2D Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming that the velocity field has finite energy and that the stagnation set is connected, we prove that the corresponding stream function solves an autonomous semilinear elliptic equation. Under some extra conditions on the vorticity near infinity we can also prove that the streamlines are concentric circles. The proofs include several energy estimates on the behavior of the stream function at infinity, as well as an adaptation of the continuous Steiner symmetrization to our setting.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit tree based ansatz for the Birkhoff normal form up to any order in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs. To do so we make use of a tree based representation of iterated Poisson brackets to encode the nested Taylor expansions along flows of a sequence of symplectic transformations. As an example we consider the cubic Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Fast Bellman algorithm for real Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new numerical algorithm for solving the Dirichlet
  problem for the real Monge-Amp\`ere equation. The idea is to represent the
  Monge-Amp\`ere operator as an infimum of a class of linear elliptic operators
  and use Bellman's principle to construct a numeric scheme for approximating
  the operator attaining this infimum.
  We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate
  the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of
  degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods. Our method runs considerably faster than the ones
  used for comparison, improving the running time by a factor of 3-10 for smooth,
  strictly convex examples, and by a factor of 20-100 or more for mildly degenerate
  examples.</description>

      <title>Duality-Based Algorithm and Numerical Analysis for Optimal Insulation Problems on Non-Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops a numerical approximation of a convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem. The physical problem involves determining the optimal distribution, given by $h\colon \Gamma_I\to [0,+\infty)$, of a given amount $m\in \mathbb{N}$ of insulating material attached to a boundary part $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \in \mathbb{N}$, subject to conductive heat transfer. To tackle the non-local and non-smooth character of the problem, the article introduces a (Fenchel) duality framework: (a) At the continuous level, using (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a posteriori error identity that can handle arbitrary admissible approximations of the primal and dual formulations of the convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem; (b) At the discrete level, using discrete (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a priori error identity that applies to a Crouzeix--Raviart discretization of the primal formulation and a Raviart--Thomas discretization of the dual formulation. The proposed framework leads to error decay rates that are optimal with respect to the specific regularity of a minimizer. In addition, we prove convergence of the numerical approximation under minimal regularity assumptions. Since the discrete dual formulation can be written as a quadratic program, it is solved using a primal-dual active set strategy interpreted as semismooth Newton method. A solution of the discrete primal formulation is reconstructed from the solution of the discrete dual formulation by means of an inverse generalized Marini formula. This is the first such formula for this class of convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend representation formulas for functions in Hardy classes of solutions to higher-order iterated Vekua equations to Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions that solve a bicomplex version of the Vekua equation or its higher-order generalizations. Using these representations, we show that functions in these bicomplex-valued Hardy classes have nontangential boundary values and boundary values in the sense of distributions.</description>

      <title>Formally Integrable Structures I. Resolution of Solution Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11176v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers on the $L^2$-theory for formally integrable structures. It is devoted to constructing a resolution of the solution sheaf for a class of overdetermined systems introduced by L. H{\"o}rmander. A sufficient condition for global exactness is obtained, which leads to gluing techniques for local solutions formulated as Cousin type problems. In addition, we also prove the local solvability of the Treves complex for formally integrable structures with vanishing Levi forms, including Levi flat structures as special cases. To the best of the authors' knowledge, nothing more than the elliptic case is known about the local $L^2$-solvability of the Treves complex in the Levi flat case.</description>

      <title>The moving plane method and the uniqueness of high order elliptic equation with GJMS operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following high order elliptic equation involving the GJMS operator:
  \begin{align*}
  \alpha P_{\mathbb{S}^n}v_{\alpha}+2Q_{g_{\mathbb{S}^n}}=2Q_{g_{\mathbb{S}^n}}e^{nv_{\alpha}}.
  \end{align*}
  We establish that if
  $\alpha&gt;1$ and $n\geq3$, or if $\alpha\in (1-\epsilon_0, 1)$ with $n=2m\geq4$, then $v_{\alpha}\equiv0$. As an application, we present a new proof of the classical Beckner inequality.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the inequalities of the form $$\int_{\Omega}|\nabla u(x)|^2h(u(x))\,{\rm d} x\leq C\int_{\Omega} \left( \sqrt{ |P u(x)||{\cal T}_{H}(u(x))|}\right)^{2}h(u(x))\,{\rm d} x +\Theta,$$ where $\Omega\subset \mathbf{R}^n$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain, $u\in W^{2,1}_{\rm loc}(\Omega)$ is non-negative, $P$ is a uniformly elliptic operator in non-divergent form, ${\cal T}_{H}(\cdot )$ is certain transformation of the monotone $C^1$ function $H(\cdot)$, which is the primitive of the weight $h(\cdot)$, and $\Theta$ is the boundary term which depends on boundary values of $u$ and $\nabla u$, which hold under some additional assumptions. Our results are linked to some results from probability and potential theories, e.g.~to some variants of the Douglas formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate finite-strain elastoplastic evolution in the nonassociative setting. The constitutive material model is formulated in variational terms and coupled with the quasistatic equilibrium system. We introduce measure-valued energetic solutions and prove their existence via a time discretization approach. The existence theory hinges on a suitable regularization of the dissipation term via a space-time mollification. Eventually, we discuss the possibility of solving the problem in the setting of functions, instead of measures.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow structure for some nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \[ \partial_{t}\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)+\int_{X}\left(\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)-\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(y)\right)\eta(x,y)d\pi(y)=0\qquad(\dagger) \] where $X$ is either $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\pi$ is a probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel'' which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure, thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus} originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions; stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.</description>

      <title>Impact of diffusion mechanisms on persistence and spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a generalized KPP equation with a ``$q$-diffusion", which is a framework that unifies various standard linear diffusion regimes: Fickian diffusion ($q = 0$), Stratonovich diffusion ($q = 1/2$), Fokker-Planck diffusion ($q = 1$), and nonstandard diffusion regimes for general $q\in\mathbb{R}$. Using both analytical methods and numerical simulations, we explore how the ability of persistence (measured by some principal eigenvalue) and how the asymptotic spreading speed depend on the parameter $q$ and on the phase shift between the growth rate $r(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$.
  Our results demonstrate that persistence and spreading properties generally depend on $q$: for example, appropriate configurations of $r(x)$ and $D(x)$ can be constructed such that $q$-diffusion either enhances or diminishes the ability of persistence and the spreading speed with respect to the traditional Fickian diffusion. We show that the spatial arrangement of $r(x)$ with respect to $D(x)$ has markedly different effects depending on whether $q &gt; 0$, $q = 0$, or $q &lt; 0$. The case where $r$ is constant is an exception: persistence becomes independent of $q$, while the spreading speed displays a symmetry around $q = 1/2$.
  This work underscores the importance of carefully selecting diffusion models in ecological and epidemiological contexts, highlighting their potential implications for persistence, spreading, and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Flow approach on the monotonicity of shape functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09485v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric flow framework to investigate the following two classical shape functionals: the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. First, by constructing novel deformation paths governed by stretching flows, we prove several new monotonicity properties of the torsional rigidity and the first eigenvalue along the evolutions restricted to triangles and rhombuses. These results also lead to new and simpler proofs of some known results, unifying and extending prior symmetrization-based proofs. Second, utilizing the mean curvature flow, we give a new proof of the Saint-Venant inequality for smooth convex bodies. This might be the first flow-based proof to establish geometric functional inequalities that couple both the domain and the state function associated with it. Third, by discovering a gradient norm inequality for the sides of rectangles, we prove monotonicity and rigidity results of the torsional rigidity on rectangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a concentrated vortex advected by a smooth, divergence-free velocity field in two space dimensions. In the idealized situation where the initial vorticity is a Dirac mass, we compute an approximation of the solution which accurately describes, in the regime of high Reynolds numbers, the motion of the vortex center and the deformation of the streamlines under the shear stress of the external flow. For ill-prepared initial data, corresponding to a sharply peaked Gaussian vortex, we prove relaxation to the previous solution on a time scale that is much shorter than the diffusive time, due to enhanced dissipation inside the vortex core.</description>

      <title>On convex domains maximizing the gradient of the torsion function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution of $-\Delta u = 1$ on convex domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions $u =0$ on $\partial \Omega$. Our main concern is the behavior of $\|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}$, also known as the maximum shear stress in Elasticity Theory and first investigated by Saint Venant in 1856. We consider the two shape optimization problems $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ |\Omega|^{1/2}$ and $\| \nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}/ H^1( \partial \Omega)$. Numerically, the extremal domain for each functional looks a bit like the rounded letter `D'. We prove that (1) either the extremal domain does not have a $C^{2 + \varepsilon}$ boundary or (2) there exists an infinite set of points on $\partial \Omega$ where the curvature vanishes. Either scenario seems curious and is rarely encountered for such problems. The techniques are based on finding a representation of the functional using only conformal geometry and classic perturbation arguments.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions for elliptic equations driven by higher order fractional Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an elliptic partial differential equation driven by higher order fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{s}$, $s \in (1,2)$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{%
  \begin{array}{ll}
  (-\Delta)^{s} u=f(x,u) &amp; \text{ in }\Omega,
  u=0 &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^n \setminus \Omega.
  \end{array}%
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  The above equation has a variational nature, and we investigate the existence and multiplicity results for its weak solutions under various conditions on the nonlinear term $f$: superlinear growth, concave-convex and symmetric conditions and their combinations.
  The existence of two different non-trivial weak solutions is established by Mountain Pass Theorem and Ekeland's variational principle, respectively.
  Furthermore, due to Fountain Theorem and its dual form, both infinitely many weak solutions with positive energy and infinitely many weak solutions with negative energy are obtained.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation principles for finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unique continuation principles are fundamental properties of elliptic partial differential equations, giving conditions that guarantee that the solution to an elliptic equation must be uniformly zero. Since finite-element discretizations are a natural tool to help gain understanding into elliptic equations, it is natural to ask if such principles also hold at the discrete level. In this work, we prove a version of the unique continuation principle for piecewise-linear and -bilinear finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Namely, we show that any solution to the discretized equation $-\Delta u = \lambda u$ with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann traces must be identically zero under certain geometric and topological assumptions on the resulting triangulation. We also provide a counterexample, showing that a nonzero \emph{inner solution} exists when the topological assumptions are not satisfied. Finally, we give an application to an eigenvalue interlacing problem, where the space of inner solutions makes an explicit appearance.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and unique ergodicity for stochastic primitive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the stochastic 3D primitive equations (PEs) with non-degenerate noise is chaotic, i.e., the corresponding top Lyapunov exponent is strictly positive almost surely. This result builds on the landmark work by Bedrossian, Blumenthal, and Punshon-Smith on Lagrangian chaos in stochastic fluid mechanics. Our primary contribution is establishing an instance where Lagrangian chaos can be proven for a fluid flow with supercritical energy, a key characteristic of 3D fluid dynamics. For the 3D PEs, establishing the existence of the top Lyapunov exponent is already a challenging task. We address this difficulty by deriving new estimates for the invariant measures of the 3D PEs, which capture the anisotropic smoothing in the dynamics of the PEs. As a by-product of our results, we also obtain the first uniqueness result for invariant measures of stochastic PEs.</description>
