      <title>Combining Direct Black Hole Mass Measurements and Spatially Resolved Stellar Kinematics to Calibrate the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ Relation of Active Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure $M_{\rm BH}$ beyond the local Universe. However, determining AGN host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\star$, and their galaxy dynamical masses $M_{\rm dyn}$, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects and different host galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which $M_{\rm BH}$ has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with VLTI/GRAVITY. Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\rm BH}$; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\sigma_\star$ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\rm log }f= 0.65 \pm 0.18$, is consistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for measuring single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws of galaxy dynamics: from gas kinematics to weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies obey a set of strict dynamical laws, which imply a close coupling between the visible matter (stars and gas) and the observed dynamics (set by dark matter in the standard cosmological context). Here we review recent results from weak gravitational lensing, which allows studying the empirical laws of galaxy dynamics out to exceedingly large radii in both late-type galaxies (LTGs) and early-type galaxies (ETGs). We focus on three laws: (1) the circular velocity curves of both LTGs and ETGs remain indefinitely flat out to several hundreds of kpc; (2) the same baryonic Tully-Fisher relation is followed by LTGs and ETGs; (3) the same radial acceleration relation (RAR) is followed by LTGs and ETGs. Combining galaxy data with Solar System data, the RAR covers about 16 orders of magnitude in the Newtonian baryonic acceleration. Remarkably, these empirical facts were predicted a priori by MOND.</description>

      <title>SIEGE III: The formation of dense stellar clusters in sub-parsec resolution cosmological simulations with individual star feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters stand at the crossroads between galaxies and single stars. Resolving the formation of star clusters in cosmological simulations represents an ambitious and challenging goal, since modelling their internal properties requires very high resolution. This paper is the third of a series within the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, where we conduct zoom-in cosmological simulations with sub-parsec resolution that include the feedback of individual stars, aimed to model the formation of star clusters in high-redshift proto-galaxies. We investigate the role of three fundamental quantities in shaping the intrinsic properties of star clusters, i. e., i) pre-supernova stellar feedback (continuous or instantaneous ejection of mass and energy through stellar winds); ii) star formation efficiency, defined as the fraction of gas converted into stars per freefall time, for which we test 2 different values (epsi_ff=0.1 and 1), and iii) stellar initial mass function (IMF, standard vs top-heavy). All our simulations are run down to z=10.5, which is sufficient for investigating some structural properties of the emerging clumps and clusters. [Abridged] The prescription for a continuous, low-intensity feedback, along with the adoption of epsi_ff=1, produces star clusters with maximum stellar density values up to 10^4 M_sun pc^(-2), in good agreement with the surface density-size relation observed in local young star clusters (YSCs). Therefore, a realistic stellar wind description and a high star formation effiency are the key ingredients that allow us to achieve realistic star clusters characterised by properties comparable to those of local YSCs. In contrast, the other models produce too diffuse clusters, in particular the one with a top-heavy IMF.</description>

      <title>The Second Case of a Major Merger Triggering a Starburst in a Green Pea Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to map H{\sc i} 21\,cm emission from the Green Pea galaxy GP~J1148+2546 at $z\approx0.0451$, only the second measurement of the H{\sc i} spatial distribution of a Green Pea. The VLA H{\sc i} 21\,cm image, the DECaLS optical image, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy show that GP~J1148+2546 has two neighbours, the nearer of which is only $\approx 17.5$~kpc away, and that the H{\sc i} 21\,cm emission extends in an inverted ``C'' shape around the Green Pea and its companions, with the highest H{\sc i} column density between the two neighbouring galaxies. The starburst in GP~J1148+2546 is likely to have been triggered by the ongoing merger with its neighbours, although the velocity field and velocity dispersion images do not show clear merger signatures at the Green Pea location. The H{\sc i} mass of the Green Pea and its immediate surroundings is $(3.58 \pm 0.37) \times 10^9 \, M_\odot$, a factor of $\approx 7.4$ lower than the total H{\sc i} mass of the system of three interacting galaxies, while the H{\sc i} depletion timescale of GP~J1148+2546 is $\approx 0.69$~Gyr, much shorter than that of typical galaxies at $z \approx 0$. We detect damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption and Ly$\alpha$ emission from the Green Pea in a Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectrum, obtaining a high H{\sc i} column density, $\approx 2.0 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$, and a low Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, $\approx 0.8$\%, consistent with the relatively low value ($\approx 5.4$) of the ratio O32~$\equiv$~[O{\sc iii}]$\lambda 5007 + \lambda 4959$/[O{\sc ii}]$\lambda$3727,3729.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave energy spectral density properties from BPASS Galactic binary population in the Milky Way galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the~\text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. Our analysis is based on combining BPASS with a Milky Way analogue galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations and the GWs these populations emit. Our investigation compares different functional forms of gravitational wave (GW) ESDs, namely the single power-law, broken power-law, and single-peak models, revealing disparities within and among Galactic binary populations. We estimate the ESDs for six different Galactic binary populations and the ESD of the total Galactic binary population for LISA. Employing a single power-law model, we predict a total Galactic binary GW signal amplitude $\alpha$ = $2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-8}$ and a slope $\beta$ = $-2.64 ^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and the ESD $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW}$ = $1.1 ^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-9}$ at 3~\text{mHz}. For the Galactic WDB binary GW signal $\alpha = 1^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta = -1.56 ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW} = 18 ^{+1}_{-1} \times 10^{-12}$. Our analysis underscores the importance of accurate noise parameter estimation and highlights the complexities of modelling realistic observations, prompting future exploration into more flexible models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Multi-epoch JWST Images of $\sim 300$ Little Red Dots: Tentative Detection of Variability in a Minority of Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and compact sources at $z \gtrsim 5$ known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) that are likely active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a comprehensive study of the variability of 314 LRDs with multi-epoch JWST observations in five deep fields: UDS, GOODS-S, GOODS-N, Abell 2744, and COSMOS. Our analyses use all publicly available JWST NIRCam imaging data in these fields, together with multi-epoch JWST MIRI images available. We measure the significance of the variabilities (signal-to-noise ratio or ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$) for all LRDs and statistically evaluate their variabilities using the ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions. We pay particular attention to the systematic offsets of photometric zero points among different epochs that seem to commonly exist. The derived ${\rm SNR}_{\rm var}$ distributions of the LRDs, including those with broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission lines, follow the standard Gaussian distribution, and are generally consistent with those of the comparison samples of objects detected in the same images. This finding suggests that the LRD population on average does not show strong variability, which can be due to super-Eddington accretion of the black holes in AGNs. Alternatively, they are dominated by galaxies. We also find eight strongly variable LRD candidates with variability amplitudes of 0.24 - 0.82 mag. The rest-frame optical SEDs of these variable LRDs should have significant AGN contribution. Future JWST observations will provide more variability information of LRDs.</description>

      <title>When LAMOST meets Gaia DR3 Exploring the metallicity of open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are valuable probes of stellar population characteristics. Their age and metallicity provide insights into the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. By studying the metallicity of OCs, we can explore the spatial distribution of composition across the Galaxy and understand stellar birth radii through chemical tagging. However, inferring the original positions of OCs remains a challenge.
  Aims. This study investigates the distribution of metallicity in the solar neighborhood using data from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST spectra. By measuring accurate ages and metallicities, we aim to derive birth radii and understand stellar migration patterns.
  Methods. We selected 1131 OCs within 3 kpc of the Sun from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR8 low-resolution spectra (R=1800). To correct the LAMOST data, we incorporated high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR3 (R=28000) using an artificial neural network. The average metallicity of the OCs was derived from reliable [Fe/H] values of their members. We examined the metallicity distribution across the Galaxy and calculated birth radii based on age and metallicity.
  Results. The correction method reduces the systematic offset in LAMOST data. We found a metallicity gradient as a function of Galactocentric distance and guiding radii. Comparisons with chemo-dynamic simulations show that observed metallicity values are slightly lower than predicted when uncertainties are ignored, but the metallicity gradients align with previous studies. We also inferred that many OCs near the Sun likely originated from the outer Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and new Variability Structure Functions at the High Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV-optical variability of quasars appears to depend on black-hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$ through physical timescales in the accretion disc. Here, we calculate mean emission radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm orb}$, of thin accretion disc models as a function of emission wavelength from 1000 to 10000 Angstrom, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx$ const, while towards higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the numerical results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm orb}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ in terms of the observables $\lambda$, $M_{\rm BH}$, and the monochromatic luminosity $L_{3000}$. We then calculate variability structure functions for the ~2200 brightest quasars in the sky with estimates for $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{3000}$, using lightcurves from NASA/ATLAS orange passband spanning more than 7 years. The median luminosity of the accretion disc sample is $\log L_{\rm bol}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})\approx 47$ and the median $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\approx 9.35$. At this high mass, the theoretical mass dependence of disc timescales levels off and turns over. The data show a weak dependence of variability on $M_{\rm BH}$ consistent with the turnover and a model where disc timescale drives variability amplitudes in the form $\log A/A_0=1/2\times\Delta t/t_{\rm orb}$, as suggested before. In the future, if the black-hole mass is known, observations of variability might be used as diagnostics of the physical luminosity in accretion discs, and therefore constrain inclination or dust extinction.</description>

      <title>A resolved, multi-wavelength study of gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster using MUSE, MeerKAT, and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine new and archival MUSE observations with data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey and the ALMA Fornax Cluster Survey to study the ionised, atomic, and molecular gas in six gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster in detail. We compare the distributions and velocity fields of the three gas phases with each other, with MUSE white-light images, and with the stellar velocity fields. Additionally, we derive the resolved molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for each object, and compare these with existing relations for field galaxies and for the Fornax and Virgo clusters. Finally, we explore global measurements such as gas deficiencies and star formation rates to paint as complete a picture of their evolutionary state as possible. We find that all six gas-rich dwarf galaxies have very disturbed ISM, with all three gas phases being irregular both in terms of spatial distribution and velocity field. Most objects lie well below the Kennicutt-Schmidt relations from the literature. Furthermore, they are quite deficient in HI (with def_HI between ~1 and ~2 dex), and moderately deficient in H2 (with def_H2 between ~0 and ~1), suggesting that, while both cold gas phases are affected simultaneously, HI is removed in significant quantities before H2. We suggest that these dwarfs are on their first infall into the cluster, and are in the process of transitioning from star-forming to passive. A combination of tidal interactions, mergers/pre-processing, and ram pressure stripping is likely responsible for these transformations.</description>

      <title>The chemical evolution of the Milky Way thin disk using solar twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we address whether the age--metallicity relation (AMR) deviates from the expected trend of metallicity increasing smoothly with age. We also show the presence (or absence) of two populations, as recently claimed using a relatively small dataset. Moreover, we studied the Milky Way thin disk's chemical evolution using solar twins, including the effect of radial migration and accretion events. In particular, we exploited high-resolution spectroscopy of a large sample of solar twins in tandem with an accurate age determination to investigate the Milky Way thin disk age--metallicity relationship. Additionally, we derived the stars' birth radius and studied the chemical evolution of the thin disk. We discovered that statistical and selection biases can lead to a misinterpretation of the observational data. An accurate accounting of all the uncertainties led us to detect no separation in the AMR into different populations for solar twins around the Sun (-0.3 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.3 dex). This lead us to the conclusion that the thin disk was formed relatively smoothly. For the main scenario of the Milky Way thin disk formation, we suggest that the main mechanism for reaching today's chemical composition around the Sun is radial migration with the possible contribution of well-known accretion events such as Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES) and Sagittarius (Sgr).</description>

      <title>Powerful outflows of compact radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources are compact radio galaxies (RGs), with jets extending up to 20 kpc and ages &lt;10^3 years. They are considered to have evolved into Fanaroff-Riley RGs, but the real scenario to explain the compact sources remains unsolved. The young compact jets make GPS/CSS ideal for studying feedback in the nuclear region of AGNs because the jets are just starting to leave this region. Numerical simulations and jet power estimates suggest that compact sources can drive outflows on scales several times larger than the radio source itself, but the lack of suitable data limits comparisons between theory and observation. We carried out an optical spectroscopic study of 82 CSS/GPS with SDSS-DR12 data to investigate the influence of compact jets in the gas. We found outflowing gas components in the [OIII]\lambda5007 emission lines in half of our sample. The kinetic energy of the outflowing gas in compact sources is comparable to that observed in extended RGs, indicating that the compact jets can drive powerful outflows similar to those in FR RGs. The observed anti-correlation between the kinetic power of the outflow and the radio luminosity suggests an interaction between the young jet and the interstellar medium (ISM). This finding provides significant observational support for previous simulations of jet-ISM interactions and supports the evolutionary scenario for RGs. However, the lack of sources with high kinetic efficiency indicates that some compact galaxies may be frustrated sources.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups with simulation-informed scatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the scaling relation between baryonic observables and dark matter halo properties is crucial not only for studying galaxy formation and evolution, but also for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. In this paper, we constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups identified by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, using weak lensing signals measured by the Kilo-Degree Survey. We compared our measured scaling relation with predictions from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations and the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model. We find general agreement between our measurements and simulation predictions for haloes with masses ${\gtrsim}10^{13.5}\ h_{70}^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, but observe slight discrepancies with the FLAMINGO simulations at lower halo masses. We explored improvements to the current halo model framework by incorporating simulation-informed scatter in the group stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass. We find that including a simulation-informed scatter model tightens the constraints on scaling relations, despite the current data statistics being insufficient to directly constrain the variable scatter. We also tested the robustness of our results against different statistical models of miscentring effects from selected central galaxies. We find that accounting for miscentring is essential, but our current measurements do not distinguish among different miscentring models.</description>

      <title>The Soltan argument at $z=6$: UV-luminous quasars contribute less than 10% to early black hole mass growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at $z=6$ to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at $z&gt;6$. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at $z&gt;6$ does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks.
  The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at $z&gt;6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\ge$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor &gt;2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch.
  The resulting consequences are: &gt;90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at $z&gt;6$, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'. This finding might severe impact on how we will diagnose SMBH growth at $z=7$ to 15 in the future.</description>

      <title>The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>A resolved Lyman-Alpha profile with doubly peaked emission at z~7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The epoch of reionization is a landmark in structure formation and galaxy evolution. How it happened is still not clear, especially regarding which population of objects was responsible for contributing the bulk of ionizing photons toward this process. Doubly-peaked Lyman-Alpha profiles in this epoch are of particular interest since they hold information about the escape of ionizing radiation and the environment surrounding the source.
  We wish to understand the escape mechanisms of ionizing radiation in Lyman-Alpha emitters during this time and the origin of a doubly-peaked Lyman-alpha profile as well as estimating the size of a potential ionized bubble.
  Using radiative transfer models, we fit the line profile of a bright Lyman-Alpha emitter at $z\sim 6.9$ using various gas geometries. The line modeling reveals significant radiation escape from this system.
  While the studied source reveals significant escape ($f_{esc}$(LyA) $\sim0.8$ as predicted by the best fitting radiative transfer model) and appears to inhabit an ionized bubble of radius $R_{b}\approx 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}\,pMpc\left(\frac{t_{\rm age}}{10^{8}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$.Radiative transfer modeling predicts the line to be completely redwards of the systemic redshift. We suggest the line morphology is produced by inflows, multiple components emitting Ly$\alpha$, or by an absorbing component in the red wing.
  We propose that CDFS-1's profile holds two red peaks produced by winds within the system. Its high $f_{esc}$(Lya) and the low-velocity offset from the systemic redshift suggest that the source is an active ionizing agent. Future observations will reveal whether a peak is present bluewards of the systemic redshift or if multiple components produce the profile.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Formation and Evolution via Phase-temporal Clustering with FuzzyCat $\circ$ AstroLink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the composition of two unsupervised clustering algorithms, $\texttt{AstroLink}$ and $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$, makes for a powerful tool when studying galaxy formation and evolution. $\texttt{AstroLink}$ is a general-purpose astrophysical clustering algorithm built for extracting meaningful hierarchical structure from point-cloud data defined over any feature space, while $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$ is a generalised soft-clustering algorithm that propagates the dynamical effects of underlying data processes into a fuzzy hierarchy of stable fuzzy clusters. Their composition, $\texttt{FuzzyCat}$ $\circ$ $\texttt{AstroLink}$, can therefore identify a fuzzy hierarchy of astrophysically- and statistically-significant fuzzy clusters within any point-based data set whose representation is subject to changes caused by some underlying process. Furthermore, the pipeline achieves this without relying upon strong assumptions about the data, the change process, the number/importance of specific structure types, or much user input -- thereby making itself applicable to a wide range of fields in the physical sciences. We find that for the task of structurally decomposing simulated galaxies into their constituents, our context-agnostic approach has a substantial impact on the diversity and completeness of the structures extracted as well as on their relationship within the broader galactic structural hierarchy -- revealing dwarf galaxies, infalling groups, stellar streams (and their progenitors), stellar shells, galactic bulges, and star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Depolarization and Faraday effects in AGN Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio interferometric observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets reveal the significant linear polarization of their synchrotron radiation that changes with frequency due to the Faraday rotation. It is generally assumed that such depolarization could be a powerful tool for studying the magnetized plasma in the vicinity of the jet. However, depolarization could also occur within the jet if the emitting and rotating plasma are co-spatial (i.e. the internal Faraday rotation). Burn obtained very simple dependence of the polarization on the wavelength squared for the discrete source and resolved slab that is widely used for interpreting the depolarization of AGN jets. However it ignores the influence of the non-uniform large scale magnetic field of the jet on the depolarization. Under the simple assumptions about the possible jet magnetic field structures we obtain the corresponding generalizations of Burn's relation widely used for galaxies analysis. We show that the frequency dependencies of the Faraday rotation measure and polarization angle in some cases allow to estimate the structures of the jets magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Euclid: High-precision imaging astrometry and photometry from Early Release Observations. I. Internal kinematics of NGC 6397 by combining Euclid and Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instruments at the focus of the Euclid space observatory offer superb, diffraction-limited imaging over an unprecedented (from space) wide field of view of 0.57 deg$^2$. This exquisite image quality has the potential to produce high-precision astrometry for point sources once the undersampling of Euclid's cameras is taken into account by means of accurate, effective point spread function (ePSF) modelling. We present a complex, detailed workflow to simultaneously solve for the geometric distortion (GD) and model the undersampled ePSFs of the Euclid detectors. Our procedure was successfully developed and tested with data from the Early Release Observations (ERO) programme focused on the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. Our final one-dimensional astrometric precision for a well-measured star just below saturation is 0.7 mas (0.007 pixel) for the Visible Instrument (VIS) and 3 mas (0.01 pixel) for the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). Finally, we present a specific scientific application of this high-precision astrometry: the combination of Euclid and Gaia data to compute proper motions and study the internal kinematics of NGC 6397. Future work, when more data become available, will allow for a better characterisation of the ePSFs and GD corrections that are derived here, along with assessment of their temporal stability, and their dependencies on the spectral energy distribution of the sources as seen through the wide-band filters of Euclid.</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope survey of Magellanic Cloud star clusters. Binaries among the split main sequences of NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly all star clusters younger than ~600 Myr exhibit extended main sequence turn offs and split main sequences (MSs) in their color-magnitude diagrams. Works based on both photometry and spectroscopy have firmly demonstrated that the red MS is composed of fast-rotating stars, whereas blue MS stars are slow rotators. Nevertheless, the mechanism responsible for the formation of stellar populations with varying rotation rates remains a topic of debate. Potential mechanisms proposed for the split MS include binary interactions, early evolution of pre-main sequence stars, and the merging of binary systems, but a general consensus has yet to be reached. These formation scenarios predict different fractions of binaries among blue- and red-MS stars. Therefore, studying the binary populations can provide valuable constraints that may help clarify the origins of the split MSs. We use high-precision photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to study the binaries of three young Magellanic star clusters exhibiting split MS, namely NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164. By analyzing the photometry in the F225W, F275W, F336W, and F814W filters for observed binaries and comparing it to a large sample of simulated binaries, we determine the fractions of binaries within the red and the blue MS. We find that the fractions of binaries among the blue MS are higher than those of red-MS stars by a factor of ~1.5, 4.6, and ~1.9 for NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164, respectively. We discuss these results in the context of the formation scenarios of the split MS.</description>

      <title>The Dog that Didn't Bark: Non-Variable Field Stars in the RR Lyrae Instability Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are easy to identify thanks to their large photometric variation and short periods. All stars in the RRL instability strip are pulsators is often a hidden assumption in most stellar population studies using RRLs. Non-variable stars in the instability strip have been discovered for Cepheids and $\delta$ Scuti, and in this paper, we report the discovery of non-variable filed stars in the RRL instability strip. Using a high-quality sample selected from Gaia DR3, we find at least 15% of the stars in the empirical instability strip where the variable fraction is &gt; 0.7 have near-zero photometric variations or variations that are significantly smaller than typical RRLs. The non-variable stars are mostly bright and close by, on cold orbits in the Galactic plane. Metallicity from Gaia BP/RP spectra suggests the non-variable stars have an average metallicity is ~ -0.5 dex, with a peak at 0. The discovery of these non-variable stars in the RRL instability strip challenges our understanding of stellar physics and further investigation is needed to understand the origin of these stars.</description>

      <title>Buchdahl bound, photon ring, ISCO and radial acceleration in Einstein-\ae{}ther theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric Einstein-{\ae}ther (E{\AE}) theory with a Maxwell-like kinetic term is revisited. We consider a general choice of the metric and the \ae{}ther field, finding that:~(i) there is a gauge freedom allowing one always to use a diagonal metric; and~(ii) the nature of the Maxwell equation forces the \ae{}ther field to be time-like in the coordinate basis. We derive the vacuum solution and confirm that the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon ring are enlarged relative to general relativity (GR). Buchdahl's theorem in E\AE{} theory is derived. For a uniform physical density, we find that the upper bound on compactness is always lower than in GR. Additionally, we observe that the Newtonian and E\AE{} radial acceleration relations run parallel in the low pressure limit. Our analysis of E\AE{} theory may offer novel insights into its interesting phenomenological generalization: \AE{}ther--scalar--tensor theory ({\AE}ST).</description>

      <title>Effects of black hole environments on extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio hyperbolic encounters (EMRHEs) around the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be observable at the future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors in space, such as LISA and Taiji. Here we consider such EMRHEs in the presence of surrounding matter distribution including baryonic accretion disk and dark matter (DM) spike, and estimate their effects on the orbital evolution and GW waveforms. We find that large possible impacts come from the gravitational potential of accretion disk, while the influence of DM spike is small. We also illustrate that environments can leave distinctive imprints on the GW waveforms, but resolving such modifications is found to be challenging for LISA-like detectors in the near future.</description>

      <title>Red giants evolutionary status determination: the complete Kepler catalog</title>

Abstract: Evolved cool stars have three distinct evolutionary status: shell Hydrogen-burning (RGB), core Helium and shell Hydrogen burning (RC), and double shell burning (AGB). Asteroseismology can distinguish between the RC and the other status, but distinguishing RGB and AGB has been difficult seismically and spectroscopically. The precise boundaries of different status in the HR diagram have also been difficult to establish. In this article, we present a comprehensive catalog of asteroseismic evolutionary status, RGB and RC, for evolved red giants in the Kepler field. We carefully examine boundary cases to define the lower edge of the RC phase in radius and surface gravity. We also test different published asteroseisemic methods claiming to distinguish AGB and RGB stars against a sample where AGB candidates were selected using a spectrocopic identification method. We used six different seismic techniques to distinguish RC and RGB stars, and tested two proposed methods for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars. These status were compared with those inferred from spectroscopy. We present consensus evolutionary status for 18,784 stars out of the 30,337 red giants present in the Kepler data, including 11,516 stars with APOGEE spectra available. The agreement between seismic and spectroscopic classification is excellent for distinguishing RC stars, agreeing at the 94% level. Most disagreements can be traced to uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters, but some are caused by blends with background stars. We find a sharp lower boundary in surface gravity at log(g) = 2.99+/-0.01 for the RC and discuss the implications. We demonstrate that asteroseismic tools for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars are consistent with spectroscopic evolutionary status at near the RC but that the agreement between the different methods decreases rapidly as the star evolves.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL search for magnetar giant flares from the Virgo Cluster and in nearby galaxies with high star formation rate</title>

Abstract: Giant flares from magnetars can reach, for a fraction of a second, luminosities greater than 10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray range. This makes them visible at distances of several megaparsecs. However, at extragalactic distances (farther than the Magellanic Clouds) they are difficult to distinguish from the short $\gamma$-ray bursts, which occur much more frequently. Since magnetars are young neutron stars, nearby galaxies with a high rate of star formation are optimal targets to search for magnetar giant flares (MGFs). Here we report the results of a search for MGFs in observations of the Virgo cluster and in a small sample of nearby galaxies obtained with the IBIS instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite. From the currently known MGF sample we find that their energy distribution is well described by a power law with slope $\gamma$=2 (with 90% c.l. interval [1.7-2.2]). From the lack of detections in this extensive data set (besides 231115A in M82) we derive a 90% c.l. upper limit on the rate of MGF with $E&gt;3\times10^{45}$ erg of $\sim2\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ per magnetar and a lower limit of $R(E)&gt;\sim4\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$ for $E&lt;10^{45}$ erg.</description>

      <title>Testing kinematic distances under a realistic Galactic potential</title>

Abstract: Obtaining reliable distance estimates to gas clouds within the Milky Way is challenging in the absence of certain tracers. The kinematic distance approach has been used as an alternative, derived from the assumption of circular trajectories around the Galactic centre. Consequently, significant errors are expected in regions where gas flow deviates from purely circular motions. We aim to quantify the systematic errors that arise from the kinematic distance method in the presence of a Galactic potential that is non-axisymmetric. We investigate how these errors differ in certain regions of the Galaxy and how they relate to the underlying dynamics. We perform 2D hydrodynamical simulation of the gas disk with the moving-mesh code Arepo, adding the capability of using an external potential provided by the Agama library for galactic dynamics. We introduce a new analytic potential of the Milky Way, taking elements from existing models and adjusting parameters to match recent observational constraints. In line with results of previous studies, we report significant errors in the kinematic distance estimate for gas close to the Sun, along sight lines towards the Galactic centre and anti-centre, and associated with the Galactic bar. Kinematic distance errors are low within the spiral arms as gas resides close to local potential minima and the resulting LOS velocity is similar to what is expected for an axisymmetric potential. Interarm regions exhibit large deviations at any given Galactic radius. This is caused by the gas being sped up or slowed down as it travels into or out of spiral arms. In addition, we identify 'zones of avoidance' in the lv-diagram, where the kinematic distance method is particularly unreliable and should only be used with caution, and we find a power law relation between the kinematic distance error and the deviation of the projected LOS velocity from circular motion.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <title>Evidence for large scale compressible turbulence in the ism of CSWA13, a star-Forming Lensed Galaxy at z = 1.87 with outflowing wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an observational paper presented spatially resolved observations of a wind outflow in CSWA13, a gravitationally lensed Star-Forming galaxy at z = 1.87. The gravitational lensing allowed for a substantially improved spatial and kinematic resolution of the wind and of the nebular gas. In this paper we take advantage of the resolved data to test for the existence of turbulence and to study its nature. We derive the spatial structure functions of the residual nebular and wind velocities along the major axis of the galaxy. The structure functions, of both velocity fields, reveal a supersonic compressible large scale turbulence. The turbulent timescale corresponding to the largest scale is about 200 Myr, an order of magnitude larger than the estimated age of the wind and of the young stars. This implies that the turbulence in the ism formed well before the wind and the young stars. Given the large spatial scale of the turbulence, it is plausible that the source of the turbulence is a large scale one e.g. a merger or tidal event that triggered the formation of molecular clouds, in the cores of which the young stars formed. A steepening of the structure functions on the smaller scales provides an estimate of the effective depth along the line of sight of the turbulent layer. The latter turns out to be about 2kpc.

      <title>Inferring stellar parameters and their uncertainties from high-resolution spectroscopy using invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10 and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in $\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus present a solid basis for future work.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the [CII] deficit in HII regions and star-forming molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse synthetic maps of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and FIR continuum of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) within the SILCC-Zoom project to study the origin of the [CII] deficit, i.e., the drop in the [CII]/FIR intensity ratio. All simulations include stellar radiative feedback and account for further ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ inside HII regions. For individual HII regions, $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and then moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast, $I_\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a large drop in $I_\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from 10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales below 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without any stars. On MC scales, $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from values $\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around $\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of the [CII] deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII] line and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The drop in $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i) early on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the increase in $L_\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly, leading to the initial decline of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In more evolved HII regions, $L_\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and even partially drops due to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets pushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ at low values of $\sim10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>The LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of Supergiants in M31 and M33</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic identifications of supergiants of M31/M33 based on massive LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Radial velocities of nearly 5000 photometrically selected M31/M33 supergiant candidates have been properly derived from the qualified spectra released in LAMOST DR10. By comparing their radial velocities with those predicted from the rotation curves of M31, as well as utilizing {\it Gaia} astrometric measurements to exclude foreground contaminations, 199 supergiant members in M31, including 168 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2', have been successfully identified. This sample contains 62 blue supergiants (BSGs, all `Rank1'), 134 yellow supergiants (YSGs, 103 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2') and 3 red supergiants (RSGs, all `Rank1'). For M33, we identify 84 supergiant members (56 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2'), which includes 28 BSGs (all `Rank1'), 53 YSGs (25 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2') and 3 RSGs (all `Rank1'). So far, this is one of the largest supergiant sample of M31/M33 with full optical wavelength coverage (3700 \textless $\lambda$ \textless 9100 \AA). This sample is valuable for understanding the star formation and stellar evolution under different environments.</description>

      <title>paired: A Statistical Framework for Detecting Stellar Binarity with Gaia RVs. I. Sensitivity to Unresolved Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data Release 3 (DR3) from the Gaia Mission includes radial velocity measurements of over 33 million targets. Among many scientific applications, the overlap of this stellar sample with targeted exoplanet transit survey stars presents an opportunity to understand planet occurrence in the context of stellar multiplicity on a large scale. Yet, any interpretation of occurrence relies upon an understanding of survey sensitivity. While the sensitivity to planets in transit surveys is well understood, a characterization of the sensitivity of Gaia to unresolved binaries is also critical. We describe here a statistical framework called paired, which we developed to enable the forward modeling of Gaia radial velocity observables for large samples of stars. The paired machinery links the reported radial velocity noise for a given star from Gaia to the probability of a spatially unresolved stellar companion. We demonstrate how this enables the user, given an observed distribution of individual binary ``probabilities" for a set of stars, to understand this distribution within the sensitivity limits of Gaia. For the subset of stars with the highest probability of excess radial velocity noise, we describe the ability of paired to constrain the semi-amplitude of the stellar binary. Where possible, we benchmark our inferred radial velocity semi-amplitudes against those from ground-based radial velocity surveys, and the subset published by Gaia DR3 itself. We aim for paired to be a community tool for the exploration of the effects of binarity on planets at a population level, but also for any user interested in stellar populations.</description>

Abstract: The new Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) eROSITA X-ray telescope has a superior response to extended soft X-rays, which makes it ideal for studying low X-ray surface brightness emission of cosmic filaments. We search for extended X-ray emission between the two nearby galaxy clusters Abell~3667 and Abell~3651, which are separated by a projected transverse distance of ${\sim}13\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, using data from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. We performed a detailed X-ray image analysis of the region between the two galaxy clusters and conducted a redshift analysis of the sources between them. We carried out a thorough surface brightness and spectral analysis between the clusters. The analysis was complemented with an X-ray pointed observation from XMM-Newton, infrared 2MASS data, and redshift information from NED. We discover an emission filament beyond the known radio relic northwest of A3667 and even beyond three times its virial radius. It is smoothly connected to A3651. The X-ray emission in the direction of the filament shows an enhancement of $30\pm3\,\%$ with a significance of $11\,\sigma$. The 2MASS map and redshift analysis show an alignment of galaxies along the filament and make a projection effect unlikely. Taking the redshift progression of galaxies within the filament into account, we estimate its three-dimensional length to be in the range of $25\,\mathrm{Mpc} - 32\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. The surface brightness analysis in combination with the temperature $T=({0.91}_{-0.11}^{+0.07})\,\mathrm{keV}$ and metallicity $Z=({0.10}_{-0.08}^{+0.05})\,\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ from the spectral analysis leads to estimates of a total flux, gas mass, and central baryon overdensity of $F_\mathrm{X}= (7.4\pm1.2)\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, $M_\mathrm{g}=(2.7^{+1.4}_{-0.8})\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $\delta_0=215^{+86}_{-50}$.</description>

      <title>The importance of stochasticity in determining galaxy emissivities and UV LFs during cosmic dawn and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of star formation and photon propagation in high-redshift galaxies can result in sizable galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in their properties. Ignoring this scatter by assuming mean quantities can bias estimates of their emissivity and corresponding observables. We construct a flexible, semi-empirical model, sampling scatter around the following mean relations: (i) the conditional halo mass function (CHMF); (ii) the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR); (iii) galaxy star formation main sequence (SFMS); (iv) fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); (v) conditional intrinsic luminosity; and (vi) photon escape fraction. In our fiducial model, ignoring scatter in these galaxy properties overestimates the duration of the EoR, delaying its completion by up to $\Delta z$ ~ 2. We quantify the relative importance of each of the above sources of scatter in determining the ionizing, soft-band X-ray and Lyman Werner (LW) emissivities as a function of scale and redshift. We find that scatter around the SFMS is important for all bands, especially at the highest redshifts where the emissivity is dominated by the faintest, most "bursty" galaxies. Ignoring this scatter would underestimate the mean emissivity and its standard deviation computed over 5 cMpc regions by factors of up to $\sim$2-10 at $5&lt; z &lt; 15$. Scatter around the X-ray luminosity to star formation rate relation is important for determining X-ray emissivity, accounting for roughly half of its mean and standard deviation. The importance of scatter in the ionizing escape fraction depends on its functional form, while scatter around the SHMR contributes at the level of ~10-20%. Although scatter does flatten the UV luminosity functions, shifting the bright end by 1-2 magnitudes, the level of scatter in our fiducial model is insufficient to fully explain recent estimates from JWST photometry (consistent with previous studies).</description>
