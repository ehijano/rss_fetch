      <title>On the mechanism of Pedestal Relaxation Events -- Insights gained by turbulence simulations with GRILLIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestal Relaxation Events (PREs) appear in I-mode discharges close to the I-H transition. Although they show certain similarities with Edge Localised Modes (ELMs), i.e. periodic energy ejections, the underlying mechanism seems to be very different from the mechanism responsible for ELMs. In this manuscript, we present global trans-collisional fluid simulations of an I-mode discharge in ASDEX Upgrade using GRILLIX. We observe multiple PREs during the simulation, which reproduce a range of experimentally observed PRE characteristics. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of various mode properties in our simulation allows us to pinpoint the underlying mechanism responsible for triggering PREs to Micro-Tearing Modes (MTMs). The system is analysed dynamically by evaluating density and electron temperature gradient lengths at the OMP position, where the MTM is located and grows over time. The path taken by the system in gradient length space is compared to a growth-rate estimate calculated by linear theory in simplified slab geometry, providing excellent agreement. Building on these insights, we sketch a qualitative picture of a full PRE cycle. Finally, we discuss the influence of the recently implemented Landau-fluid closure and the challenges of simulating low collisionality regimes with trans-collisional fluid models, like the one employed by GRILLIX.</description>

      <title>Control of kinetic plasma instabilities by laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of controlling kinetic plasma instabilities by using lasers to apply external electromagnetic fields. We derive the dispersion relation for the corresponding mathematical description, a reduced Vlasov--Maxwell system, by extending the well-known Penrose condition. It is observed that, under very mild assumptions, the dispersion relation decouples into two parts. The first part is identical to the classic Penrose condition for the Vlasov--Poisson system, while the second part describes the influence of the laser on the transverse dynamics (e.g. a Weibel instability). In particular, this means that the longitudinal dynamics (e.g. a two-stream instability) can not be stabilized in this manner as far as linear theory is concerned. We show, however, that nonlinear effects can be used to couple the two parts and achieve effective control. This is done by determining the control parameters (i.e. the form of the external electric and magnetic fields) by solving a PDE-constrained optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Programmable Focal Elongation and Shaping of High-Intensity Laser Pulses using Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the intensity distribution of laser pulses in the focal region is essential for optimizing optically generated plasma waveguides and enabling advanced plasma acceleration techniques, including dephasingless wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a method for programmatic structuring of the high-intensity focal region of a standard off-axis parabolic mirror, extending the length of this region well beyond the Rayleigh length and enabling control over the longitudinal intensity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Flow Crossover and Parallel Outflow during Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell simulations that label ions and electrons according to their initial inflow region, we find that during 2D collisionless magnetic reconnection, the bulk flow of the plasma from each inflow side crosses paths with plasma from the other inflow side and crosses the midplane before being redirected into an outflow jet. This feature, which we term ``flow crossover,'' implies mechanisms to generate bulk motion in a direction parallel to the magnetic field. We find that ions and electrons undergo different parallel driving mechanisms, leading to different flow crossover patterns. The parallel bulk flow for ions is generated more locally within the ion diffusion region, whereas the parallel bulk flow for electrons is mostly generated outside the electron diffusion region. Consequently, the reconnection outflows are more of a parallel flow than a perpendicular flow, especially for the electron outflow. The flow crossover and the parallel outflow patterns occur not only in symmetric reconnection but also in the more complex scenario of a guide-field asymmetric reconnection, suggesting that it is a general feature of collisionless magnetic reconnection. Because the plasma on one side of the outflow mostly originates from the inflow plasma on the other side, we predict that near an asymmetric reconnection site in a collisionless space plasma, in situ observations across the outflow region could reveal locally reversed gradients in plasma properties.</description>

      <title>Is Turbulence able to Generate Magnetic Islands in Tokamaks? Gyrokinetic Simulations of Turbulence-Driven Magnetic Islands in Toroidal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a universal mechanism for turbulence-driven magnetic islands in fusion plasmas. Using gyrokinetic simulations of a linearly stable tearing mode in a large-aspect-ratio toroidal geometry under collisionless conditions, we demonstrate that micro-instabilities generate an $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ flow that drives magnetic field line reconnection. This process forms multiple small-scale islands along the resonant surface, which interact nonlinearly and eventually coalesce into large-scale magnetic islands. These islands are capable of significantly flattening the equilibrium profile across the island O-points and thus acting as a seed for their further neoclassical growth. Notably, the mechanism operates independently of the parity of the destabilizing micro-instability.</description>

      <title>Attosecond electron bunch generation by an intense high-order harmonic pulse interacting with a thin target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-accelerated electron bunches and the secondary radiation sources they produce exhibit unique temporal resolution for probing ultrafast physical processes due to their ultrashort pulse duration. The inherently short temporal profile of these pulses leads to extremely high peak bunch currents, thereby enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, we propose an innovative method for generating such bunch by utilizing high-harmonics generated through laser-plasma interaction as the driving pulse, which subsequently interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron bunch. Using this method, we successfully generated an electron bunch characterized by excellent collimation and an ultra-short duration of approximately 100 attoseconds, representing a substantial reduction in bunch duration. The total bunch charge achieved was 0.38 nC, with an emittance of $4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm} \cdot \text{mrad}$ and a divergence angle of approximately $10^\circ$. Moreover, by systematically analyzing the effects of laser intensity and target positioning, we determined an optimized set of simulation parameters. This research establishes a robust foundation for the generation of ultrashort electron bunches and opens new prospects for their application in advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Avalanches in Magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of many natural systems, including solar flares, where energy release spans a vast range of scales. Recent computational advances, at the level of both algorithmics and hardware, have enabled high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to span multiple scales, offering new insights into magnetic energy dissipation processes. Here, we study scale invariance of magnetic energy dissipation in two distinct MHD simulations. Current sheets are identified and analyzed over time. Results demonstrate that dissipative events exhibit scale invariance, with power-law distributions characterizing their energy dissipation and lifetimes. Remarkably, these distributions are consistent across the two simulations, despite differing numerical and physical setups, suggesting universality in the process of magnetic energy dissipation. Comparisons between the evolution of dissipation regions reveals distinct growth behaviors in high plasma-beta regions (convective zone) and low plasma-beta regions (atmosphere). The latter display spatiotemporal dynamics similar to those of avalanche models, suggesting self-organized criticality and a common universality class.</description>

      <title>Thermal instability and multiphase dynamics in the ISM with polybaric pressure effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of thermal instability (TI) in interstellar matter (ISM), considering it to be a weakly ionised inviscid plasma with radiation loss. We carry out the simulation using our multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) code, which incorporates a background magnetic field and anisotropic pressure. The anisotropic pressure is modelled with a polybaric pressure model. The findings of our analysis are consistent with the contemporary status of knowledge about the multiphase nature of the ISM, with volume and mass fractions of the various components of the ISM, that is, warm, cold, and unstable neutral matter (UNM) in the ranges reported by various numerical and observational analyses. Though the strength of the background magnetic field only marginally affects the overall evolution, the ratio of the parallel and perpendicular pressures can considerably alter the mass and volume fractions of the three phases, which can affect the overall evolution of the TI in the long run.</description>

      <title>Semi-Implicit Continuum Kinetic Modeling of Weakly Collisional Parallel Transport in a Magnetic Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present implicit-explicit (IMEX) kinetic simulations of weakly collisional parallel plasma transport in magnetic mirror configurations using the continuum code \textsc{COGENT}. The numerical scheme employs a Jacobian-free Newton--Krylov method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning to overcome the severe time-step limitations imposed by strong mirror forces in fully explicit schemes. Applied to parameters relevant to the WHAM mirror experiment, the IMEX approach enables time steps up to $2.5 \times 10^4$ times larger than those permitted by explicit methods, resulting in a 2500x speedup in 1D--2V simulations of parallel transport with kinetic ions and Boltzmann electrons. Additionally, a reduced bounce-averaged model for a square mirror is implemented to support the computationally intensive fully kinetic simulations. The bounce-averaged formulation is used to evaluate the numerical convergence of the velocity-space discretization algorithms and to assess the role of the collision model by comparing simulations employing the nonlinear Fokker--Planck and the simplified Lenard--Bernstein--Dougherty collision operators.</description>

      <title>Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (c/\omega_{pe})^2\mu_0\vec{j} \right)$ with $\omega_{pe}$ the plasma frequency and $\vec{j}$ the current density. In three dimensional space, the practical importance of the ideal evolution of $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ on its reconnection appears limited. When the evolution velocity of modified field is chaotic, $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ will reconnect on a timescale that depends only logarithmically on any non-ideal effect that is diffusive, such as resistivity, with a current density enhancement that is also proportional to the logarithm. In near ideal magnetic fields, this logarithm is typically of order ten, and it is difficult to conceive of a physically realistic situation in which it larger than a hundred.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charged liquid microdroplets have generated significant interest recently due to the observation of chemical reaction rate enhancement by orders of magnitude. Droplet charging by plasma irradiation has been observed along with significantly enhanced reaction rates in liquid. In this paper we measure the charge on fixed size (47 $\mu$m) individual droplets, exposed for approximately 4 ms to a low temperature RF-driven plasma operated at atmospheric pressure. The measured charge values (0.8 - 2.0 $\times 10^{7}$ electrons) approached the Rayleigh limit for the given droplet diameter. Results were compared with finite element simulations of plasma charging which provided estimates of surface electric fields and charge fluxes to the droplet surface and helps advance the development of a theoretical framework for plasma-charged microreactors.</description>

Abstract: A new computational method to solve the hyperbolic (Vlasov) equation and the elliptic (Poisson-like) equation at the polar axis is proposed. It is shown that the value of a scalar function at the polar axis can be predicted by its neighbouring values based on the continuity condition. This continuity condition systematically solves the pole problems including the singular factor 1/r in the hyperbolic equation and the inner boundary in the elliptic equation. The proposed method is applied to the global gyrokinetic simulation of the tokamak plasma with the magnetic axis included.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electron occurrence and lifetimes in the outer radiation belt and slot region during the maximum of solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses relativistic and ultra-relativistic electron occurrence and loss timescales within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several strong and severe geomagnetic storms that all, remarkably, flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons. These allow the first definitive multi-MeV electron lifetimes to be calculated in this region and indicate an elevated risk to satellites in slot region orbits during periods of heightened solar activity. The HEEF outer belt loss timescales are broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles, but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster-decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions, but the variability within the spread is not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This suggests the limitations of using pitch-angle diffusion to account for the decay of elevated electrons following geomagnetic storms, and the need for more sophisticated space weather indices for radiation belt forecasting.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressible turbulence governs energy transfer across scales in space and astrophysical systems. Capturing both the turbulence cascade and damping is therefore crucial for models of energy conversion, plasma heating, and particle transport in diverse plasma environments, but remains challenging. Progress is constrained by two unresolved fundamental questions: the persistence of the turbulence cascade in the presence of shocks and discontinuities, and the validity of classical wave theories under strong nonlinearity. In particular, it remains unclear whether meaningful cascade dynamics can be defined in compressible turbulence with phase steepening, and whether frameworks developed for monochromatic waves remain applicable to complex, broadband fluctuations. Using large-scale, high-resolution kinetic simulations, we analyze turbulence-particle interactions, which are beyond the capability of standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We show that compressible turbulence damping at MHD scales in quantitative agreement with transit-time damping theory, even in fully developed nonlinear states. Moreover, the cascade persists despite the generation of shocks and discontinuities due to phase steepening, revealing a surprising robustness of cross-scale energy transfer under extreme conditions. We further provide the spectral expression of compressible turbulence. These results close a long-standing gap in the physics of compressible turbulence and establish a robust foundation for turbulence modeling from the heliosphere to galaxies.</description>
