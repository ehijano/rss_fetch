      <title>Long-lived Light Mediators in a Higgs Portal Model at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for beyond the Standard Model (SM) physics, long-lived particles (LLPs) have emerged as potential candidates and are being explored in various ongoing experiments. Future lepton colliders, such as the FCC-ee, shall provide an excellent opportunity to probe LLPs, owing to their clean environment and improved particle identification. This study investigates the potential of the proposed Innovative Detector for an Electron-Positron Accelerator (IDEA) detector at FCC-ee in the detection of LLPs produced from $B$-meson and Higgs boson decays. We explore benchmark scenarios for different final states resulting from LLP decays, including a detailed analysis of the SM long-lived hadronic background. Additionally, we propose dedicated LLP detectors with different configurations, dimensions, and locations with respect to the IDEA detector. DELIGHT B, originally proposed as a dedicated LLP detector for the FCC-hh, stands out as the detector with the maximum efficiency for detecting LLPs produced at FCC-ee. We find that cylindrical detector configurations, if feasible to construct around the IDEA detector, would also enhance sensitivity for LLPs mostly decaying outside it.</description>

      <title>Exotic $h \to Z a$ Higgs decays into $\tau$ leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic Higgs decays are among the most promising areas to be explored at the High-Luminosity LHC, given the unprecedentedly large amount $(\sim 3 \times 10^8)$ of 125 GeV Higgs bosons that will be produced. In this context, we propose a new search channel for which the Higgs boson decays to a (leptonically decaying) $Z$ boson and a light BSM pseudoscalar $a$, which subsequently decays to a pair of $\tau$-leptons ($h \to Z a \to \ell\ell \tau\tau $). After performing a validation of existing ATLAS and CMS exotic Higgs decay searches in related channels, we analyze the HL-LHC projected sensitivity of our $a\to \tau\tau$ search, targeting the kinematic region where the exotic Higgs decay is two-body. We are able to probe pseudoscalar masses $m_a \in [5,\, 33]$ GeV by leveraging both leptonic and hadronic $\tau$ decays, and establish model-independent 95\% C.L. sensitivity projections on the branching fraction ${\rm BR}(h \to Z a) \times {\rm BR}(a \to \tau\tau)$. These $a\to \tau\tau$ projections yield a competitive probe of light pseudoscalars, which depending on the model can become significantly more sensitive than projections from existing experimental searches in $a \to \mu\mu$ and $a \to \gamma\gamma$ final states. Finally, we explore the potential of our search to probe an Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) solution to the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly (when taken face-value), finding that our proposed $h\to Z a$, $a\to\tau\tau$ search can provide valuable constraints on such ALP scenario, in complementarity with existing $h\to Z a$, $a \to \gamma\gamma$ experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis and Neutrino Masses Via Pseudo-Dirac Gauginos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a $U(1)_{R-L}$-symmetric supersymmetric model, pseudo-Dirac bino and wino can act like right-handed neutrinos, generating the light neutrino masses through a hybrid Type I + III inverse seesaw mechanism. We investigate such a model to accommodate the baryon asymmetry of the universe together with neutrino masses. A pseudo-Dirac gaugino goes under particle-antiparticle oscillations. Possible $CP$ violation in bino decays, induced by mixing with the neutrinos, can be enhanced in bino--antibino oscillations. Focusing on a long-lived bino, we show that its oscillations and decays can generate the observed baryon asymmetry while the wino is responsible for generating the neutrino masses. This mechanism requires a decoupled mass spectrum with a bino of mass $M_{\tilde{B}}\sim O({\rm TeV})$ and sfermions with mass $M_{\rm sf}\gtrsim 25$ TeV. Furthermore, for the bino to decay out-of-equilibrium before the electroweak sphalerons turn off, the messenger scale needs to be $\Lambda_M \sim O(10^7~ {\rm TeV})$. We discuss the displaced vertex signals at the LHC resulting from such a high messenger scale.</description>

      <title>Can we determine the exact size of the nucleon?: A comprehensive study of different radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of nucleon radii plays a central role in our understanding of the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Rekindling s-Wave Dark Matter Annihilation Below 10GeV with Breit-Wigner Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity-independent (s-wave) annihilation of thermal Dark Matter is ruled out by CMB data for masses below 10GeV, effectively ruling out the possibility of indirectly detecting it in this mass range. We demonstrate in a model-independent framework that Breit-Wigner effects from very narrow resonances can circumvent CMB constraints, thereby reviving the potential to detect s-wave DM annihilation in the present Universe. The density of resonant s-wave Dark Matter continues to evolve long after chemical decoupling, leading to a scenario we refer to as belated freeze-out, where kinetic decoupling plays a significant role in determing the relic density.</description>

      <title>NGAMMA: A Monte Carlo generator for multiphoton production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the NGAMMA Monte Carlo event generator for QED processes of $e^+e^-$ annihilation into a multiphoton final state, $e^+e^-\to N\gamma (N \ge 2)$. These processes are an important source of background in the study of $e^+e^-\to hadrons$ processes with a multiphoton final state, especially for low energy $e^+e^-$ colliders like VEPP-2000 and $\rm DA\Phi NE$. For generation, NGAMMA exploits a tree-level amplitude calculated using the spinor technique.</description>

      <title>Probes of Anomalous Events at LHC with Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Neural Network Architecture based Unsupervised Learning Algorithm, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), for the probe of a rare top decay mediated by Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) to charm and Higgs boson, with the Higgs boson further decaying to $b \bar{b}$ in a boosted regime. Events with large-R jets, ideally comprising three-prong substructures with b- and c-tagged subjets, are considered. We have illustrated that SOM can be effectively implemented as an anomaly-probing prescription for model-independent searches of top FCNC decay at the LHC. Relatively simple in formalism, this algorithm achieves a commendable performance over other existing formalisms, for the said probe. The steps formulated for this work are robust in their implementation and can be successfully followed for other BSM probes.</description>

      <title>eV-scale sterile neutrino: A window open to non-unitarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excess observed in the accelerator neutrino experiments in the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ channel at high confidence level (CL) has been interpreted as due to eV-scale sterile neutrino(s). But, it has been suffered from the problem of ``appearance - disappearance tension'' at the similarly high CL because the measurements of the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ channel do not observe the expected event number depletion corresponding to the sterile contribution in the appearance channel. We suggest non-unitarity as a simple and natural way of resolving the tension, which leads us to construct the non-unitary $(3+1)$ model. With reasonable estimation of the parameters governing non-unitarity, we perform an illustrative analysis to know if the tension is resolved in this model. At the best fit of the appearance signature we have found the unique solution with $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.3$, which is consistent with the (reactors + Ga) data combined fit. Unexpectedly, our tension-easing mechanism bridges between the two high CL signatures, the BEST and LSND-MiniBooNE anomalies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon in a meson dominance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Gravity induced CP violation in mesons mixing, decay and interference experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of earth's gravity on neutral mesons dynamics is analyzed. The main effect of a Newtonian potential is to couple the strangeness and bottomness oscillations with the quark zitterbewegung oscillations. This coupling is responsible for the observed CP violation in the three types of experiments analyzed here: (i) indirect violation in the mixing, (ii) direct violation in the decay to one final state and (iii) violation in interference between decays with and without mixing. The three violation parameters associated with these experiments are predicted in agreement with the experimental data. The amplitude of the violation is linear with respect to the strength of gravity so that this new mechanism allows to consider matter dominated cosmological evolutions providing the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Chiral Gauge Theories with Flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact results in $\text{SU}(N_C)$ chiral gauge theories with charged fermions in an antisymmetric, $N_F$ fundamental, and $N_C + N_F - 4$ anti-fundamental representations. We achieve this by considering the supersymmetric version of these theories and utilizing anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking at a scale $m\ll\Lambda$ to generate a vacuum. The connection to non-supersymmetric theories is then argued by taking the limit $m\rightarrow\infty$. For odd $N_C$, we determine the massless fermions and unbroken global symmetries in the infrared. For even $N_C$, we find global symmetries are non-anomalous and no massless fermions. In all cases, the symmetry breaking patterns differ from what the tumbling hypothesis would suggest.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Self-Interacting Dark Matter from Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, we show that SIDM models with a massive force mediator can support dense enough DM spikes, significantly affecting BH mergers and producing a distinct GW dephasing. Using ${N}$-body simulations, we analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning's remarkable practical successes have sparked extensive theoretical investigations, yet fundamental breakthroughs remain elusive. Here, we study neural network training via gradient descent and demonstrate that the resulting dynamics can be described by a field theory in de Sitter space. We illustrate this correspondence with a simple example of neural network in which the continuum limit is explicitly realized. Since de Sitter space is well-studied in both field theory and general relativity, our findings suggest new avenues for understanding neural network training and for leveraging established theoretical frameworks to advance machine learning theory.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Backgrounds in Solid-State Phonon and Charge Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state phonon and charge detectors probe the scattering of weakly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos, through their low recoil thresholds. Recent advancements have pushed sensitivity to eV-scale energy depositions, uncovering previously-unseen low-energy excess backgrounds. While some arise from known processes such as thermal radiation, luminescence, and stress, others remain unexplained. This review examines these backgrounds, their possible origins, and parallels to low-energy effects in solids. Their understanding is essential for interpreting particle interactions at and below the eV-scale.</description>

Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Dependence of Neutrino-driven Supernova Explosions with the Aid of Heavy Axion-like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.</description>

      <title>Advancing multimessenger approaches in heavy-ion collisions: Insights from electromagnetic probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) probes, including photons and dileptons, do not interact strongly after their production in heavy-ion collisions, allowing them to carry undistorted information from their points of origin. This makes them powerful tools for studying early-stage equilibration and the thermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In these proceedings, we highlight recent theoretical advancements in EM probes, focusing on their role in probing early-stage dynamics and extracting medium properties. We also discuss the emerging multimessenger approach, which combines hadronic and electromagnetic probes to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the QGP.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects, such as magnetars, neutron star mergers, etc, have strong electromagnetic fields beyond the Schwinger field ($B_c = 4.4 \times 10^{13}\, {\rm G}$). In strong electric fields, electron-positron pairs are produced from the vacuum, gamma rays create electron-positron pairs in strong magnetic fields, and propagating photons experience vacuum refringence, etc. Astrophysical compact objects with strong electromagnetic fields open a window for probing fundamental physics beyond weak field QED. Ultra-intense lasers and high-energy charged particles may simulate extreme astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Penrose limit connects a plane wave geometry to the photon ring of a black hole, where the quasi-normal modes are located in the eikonal limit. Utilizing this simplification, we analytically extract the quadratic-level non-linearities in the quasi-normal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole for the $(\ell\times\ell)\to 2\ell$ channel. We demonstrate that this result is independent of $\ell$ and further confirm it through symmetry arguments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the correlation between ZTF TDEs and IceCube high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contributors of the IceCube diffuse neutrino flux remain unclear. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as potential emitters of the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube. Therefore, investigating the correlation between the TDE population and IceCube neutrinos could help us better understand whether the TDE population could be potential high-energy neutrino emitters. In this paper, we perform a systematic search for TDEs that are associated with neutrinos in a sample including 143 IceCube neutrino alert events and 61 TDEs classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) - Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, considering that the TDEs/TDE candidates reported as potential IceCube neutrino emitters are all accompanied by infrared (IR) observations, we further select the TDEs with IR observations from these 61 TDEs as a subsample to examine the correlation with neutrinos. Based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission database, seven TDEs are identified as having IR observations. Due to good spatial localization is crucial for association analysis, we employ two methods to handle alert events with large error radii in our sample. Then we employ three Monte Carlo simulation methods to investigate the correlation between TDE sample/subsample and IceCube neutrinos. Finally, after considering spatial and temporal criteria, seven TDEs with IR flares show the most significant correlation at a 2.43{\sigma} confidence level. If we tentatively further take the time delay factor into account in the weighting scheme, the correlation enhances to 2.54{\sigma} confidence level.</description>

      <title>Beta-Functions and RG flows for Holographic QCD with Heavy and Light Quarks: Isotropic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512v3], we investigated the dependence of the running coupling constant on temperature and chemical potential for holographic models of the light and heavy quarks, supported by an Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action. In this paper, we study the dependence of the corresponding $\beta$-functions on the temperature and the chemical potential. As in the previous paper, we give special attention to the behavior of the $\beta$-functions near the 1st order phase transitions. We consider different types of boundary conditions for the dilaton. Only one of the possible boundary conditions yields results that agree with lattice calculations at zero chemical potential. The corresponding $\beta$-functions are negative and exhibit jumps at the 1st order phase transitions. We also show that the RG fluxes are invariant with respect to the choice of the boundary conditions and that our exact solutions for the light and heavy quarks are unstable, as expected, given their negative dilaton potentials.</description>

      <title>Inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inelastic charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(nS)$) photoproduction and fragmentation processes in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies, where the ultra-incoherent photon emission is included. In the framework of the NRQCD factorization approach, an exact treatment is developed which recovers Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams approximation (WWA) near the region $Q^{2}\sim0$, where the methods of Martin-Ryskin and BCCKL are used to avoid double counting. We calculate the $Q^{2}$, $y$, $z$, $\sqrt{s}$, $p_{T}$ dependent and the total cross sections. It turns out that the inelastic photoproduction and fragmentation processes provide valuable contributions to the heavy quarkonium production, especially in the large $p_{T}$ regions. While the relative contribution of ultra-incoherent photon channel is very important, which rapidly increases along with the growing quarkonium mass, and begins to dominate the photoproduction processes at large $p_{T}$ ranges. Moreover, we obtain the complete validity scopes of WWA in inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions. WWA has a much higher accuracy at high energies and in $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions. The existing photon spectra are generally derived beyond the applicable scopes of WWA, and the double counting exists when the different channels are considered simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Note on Klein-Nishina effect in strong-field QED: the case of nonlinear Compton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suitably normalized differential probabilities of one-photon emission in external electromagnetic fields are compared to quantify the transit of nonlinear Compton scattering to linear Compton scattering, described by the Klein-Nishina formula, and to constant crossed field treatment. The known Klein-Nishina suppression at large energies is further enforced by increasing field intensity. In view of the Ritus-Narozhny conjecture, we demonstrate that different paths in the field intensity vs. energy plane towards large values of the quantum non-linearity parameter $\chi$ facilitate significantly different asymptotic dependencies, both in the Klein-Nishina regime and the constant crossed field regime and in between.</description>

      <title>Folded Context Condensation in Path Integral Formalism for Infinite Context Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing an emergent metric developed from deep learning techniques, we determine the complex potential associated with static quarkonium. This study explores the disintegration process of quarkonium by analyzing the real component of this potential, which is crucial for understanding its stability in various conditions. We show that the dissociation length, the critical distance at which a quark and antiquark pair disintegrate, decreases as the temperature increases. Furthermore, our assessment of the imaginary component of the potential indicates an increase in the magnitude of the imaginary potential for quarkonium as temperatures rise. This enhancement contributes to the quarkonium's suppression within the quark-gluon plasma, mirroring the anticipated outcomes from QCD. Our findings not only confirm the theoretical predictions but also demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning methods in advancing our understanding of high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>Photon-likeness of hadron showers and impact of Lorentz boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the probability of proton-induced air showers at $E&gt;10\,$EeV being misidentified as photon-induced due to neutral pions receiving a major part of the primary energy in the first interaction, thereby enhancing the electromagnetic shower component by their $\pi^0 \to \gamma \gamma$ decay. Using CORSIKA simulations, we demonstrate the relevance of this effect at EeV energies. However, the probability for such photon-like events drops down strongly at the highest energies due to the increasing probability of Lorentz boosted $\pi^0$'s suffering hadronic interactions before decay. Different hadronic interaction models suggest that photon-like hadronic events may be observed at current UHECR observatories. A quantitative comparison of the observed number of background events found in recent photon searches published by the Pierre Auger Collaboration allows us conclude that the hypothesis of upwards fluctuations of $\pi^0$-production alone is insufficient to explain the data.</description>

We propose three types of minimum predictive models with different assignments of modular weight, satisfying the neutrino oscillation data in Nufit 5.2. The cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass is stringent to our models and CMB bound $\sum D_\nu\le0.12$ eV can be satisfied by one of three models playing an important role in discriminating them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and compute two-loop contributions proportional to the top quark Yukawa coupling for the operator generating an effective Higgs-gluon coupling, focusing on the Yukawa-like operator. These two-loop running effects are relevant for processes where the effective Higgs-gluon coupling contributes at a lower loop order compared to the Standard Model contribution and where a dynamical scale choice is adopted. Such a situation arises, for instance, in the Higgs transverse momentum distribution and Higgs pair production. We investigate the phenomenological impact of our computations on these two processes and find that the two-loop contributions are significant and can lead to deviations of up to 20\% in the scenarios we consider.</description>

Abstract: Light bosonic dark matter fields that can be treated like a classical wave have non-linear field values close to massive bodies. Here we make the important observation that the quadratic interactions of axion dark matter lead to non-perturbative axion field values for values of the decay constant of $f\lesssim 10^{13}$ GeV and masses $m_a\lesssim 7\times10^{8}/f\ {\rm eV^2}$ and generalise this result for axion-like particles.

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Gravitinos Through Large-Scale Structure Observations</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim 25~(11)\text{ GeV}$ at $95\%\text{ C.L.}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Wigner rotations for cascade reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrization of cascading hadronic reactions is a central tool in hadron spectroscopy for modeling matrix elements and extracting parameters of hadronic states. Implementing the helicity formalism consistently presents challenges, particularly for particles with spin, due to the need to match spin states of final-state particles, an operation known as the Wigner rotation. This paper discusses these challenges in detail and offers solutions, including a practical method for implementation. Equipped with a general algorithm for computing Wigner rotations, we extend the studies to alternative amplitude formulations, the minus-phi and canonical conventions.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>Chiral transition and meson melting within improved holographic soft wall models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

      <title>Collider-Flavour Complementarity from the bottom to the top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recently observed anomalies in the flavour sector, we analyse the potential of measurements of top quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to provide complementary constraints on interactions that shape low-energy precision investigations in the $B$ sector. The measurement of top quark properties, such as the top width and the abundant top pair production channels, are already reaching the percent level at this relatively early stage of the LHC phenomenology program. A focused analysis of four-fermion interactions, employing effective field theory without flavour structure assumptions and incorporating renormalization group evolution effects, bridges $B$ meson scale phenomena with key top quark measurements. We demonstrate that the LHC is increasingly competitive with, and complementary to, flavour physics constraints. Our results, which include a first comprehensive analysis of non-leptonic B decays in this context, suggest that the LHC's top physics program could serve as a valuable, complementary tool in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model within the flavour sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-photon and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in both systems share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase and providing a novel perspective on axion experiments. We conceptually propose a new photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase offers a unique method for probing the global structure of the Standard Model gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>A 95 GeV Higgs Boson in the $U(1)_X$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have recently reported their findings based on the comprehensive run 2 dataset, detailing their searches for a light Higgs boson with a mass of approximately 95 GeV. We investigate the excesses observed in the $\gamma\gamma$, and $b{\bar b}$ data at approximately 95 GeV in the $U(1)_X$ model. Additionally, it also mixes with the SM-like Higgs boson. Research indicates that, in this model, identifying this singlet Higgs state as the lightest Higgs boson holds tremendous potential for explaining the excess observed at approximately 95 GeV. In our calculations, we maintain the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest Higgs bosons at approximately 95 GeV and 125 GeV, respectively. The study finds that the theoretical predictions for the signal strengths $\mu(h_{95})_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $\mu(h_{95})_{b{\bar b}}$ in the $U(1)_X$ model align well with the excesses observed by CMS.</description>

      <title>New physics effects on $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decays in a general and model-independent way. The $\chi^2$ fits for fractions of the branching ratios $R(D^{(*)})$ and other polarization parameters are implemented. We parameterize the relevant Wilson coefficients with a new physics scale and its power together with combined fermionic couplings. Constraints from $B_c\to\tau\nu$ are imposed such that its branching ratio is less than 30%. For a moderate range of our parameters we find that the new physics scale goes up to $\lesssim 27$ TeV for ordinary new particle contributions. It turns out that the polarization asymmetry of $\tau$ for $B\to D$ transition can be negative only for a few combinations of the new physics operators. We also discuss related processes $B_c\to J/\Psi\tau\nu$ and $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c\tau\nu$ decays.</description>

      <title>High-energy Coulomb scattering of spatially extended particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze pure Coulomb high-energy elastic scattering of charged particles (hadrons or nuclei), discarding their strong interactions. We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant. This indicates the unsuitability of the potential approach. However, in the case of Coulomb scattering of heavy nuclei, the leading one is the optical approximation, which formally reproduces the prescription of the potential approach.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson production in association with massive bottom quarks at NNLO+PS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the production of a Higgs boson in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b \bar b H$) at hadron colliders. Our calculation is performed in the four-flavour scheme with massive bottom quarks. This work presents the first computation of next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections to this process, and we combine them with all-order radiative corrections from a parton shower simulation (NNLO+PS). The calculation is exact, except for the two-loop amplitude, which is evaluated in the small quark mass expansion, which is an excellent approximation for bottom quarks at LHC energies. For the NNLO+PS matching, we employ the MiNNLO$_{\rm PS}$ method for heavy-quark plus colour-singlet production within the POWHEG framework. We present an extensive phenomenological analysis both at the inclusive level and considering bottom jets using flavour-tagging algorithms. By comparing four-flavour and five-flavour scheme predictions at NNLO+PS, we find that the NNLO corrections in the four-flavour scheme resolve the long-standing tension between the two schemes. Finally, we show that our NNLO+PS predictions also have important implications on modelling the $b\bar b H$ background in Higgs-pair measurements.</description>

      <title>Parity Violation on Longitudinal Single-Spin Asymmetries at the EicC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore two longitudinal single-spin asymmetries induced from parity violation in neutral-current deep inelastic scattering at the proposed Electron-ion collider in China (EicC): $A_{PV}^{e\,(p)}$ from longitudinally polarized (unpolarized) electrons scattering off unpolarized (longitudinally polarized) protons. We find $A_{PV}^e$, of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, is generically one to three orders of magnitude larger than $A_{PV}^p$. We further estimate different uncertainty sources including statistics, parton distribution functions, and beam polarization, for both asymmetries, and then identify individually their dominance in different regimes of the Bjorken-$x$. Based on these results, we then advocate utilizing $A_{PV}^p$ for the extraction of the weak mixing angle at two representative momentum transfer scales unexplored before, and we find a relative precision below 10% can be achieved at the EicC with an effective one-year operation time.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the $G$(3900) quantum numbers $J^{PC}$ in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII observation of exotic hadron $G$(3900) [PRL 133(2024)081901], we use the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE to simulate the $G$(3900) production in $e^+e^-$ annihilations at $\sqrt s$=4.95 GeV. The $G$(3900) candidates are recombined by Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model using component mesons of $D\bar D$ or $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ in the PACIAE simulated final hadronic state. We then calculate the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame for the first time and perform the spectral classification for each of the above $G$(3900) candidates. Our results confirm the BESIII observation of $G$(3900) in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D^0\bar D^0/ D^+D^-$ processes and suggest that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D$ is $D$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$. Moreover, our results indicate that the $G$(3900) composed of $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ is $P$-wave dominant with $J^{PC}=$ $0^{-+}$, $1^{-+}$ or $2^{-+}$, which is consistent with the conclusion in PRL 133(2024)241903. Finally, significant discrepancies in the yields, the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the $G$(3900) $S$-wave, $P$-wave, and $D$-wave states are observed. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria for deciphering the $G$(3900) orbital angular momentum quantum number and $J^{PC}$.</description>

      <title>Production of $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium-like states in electron-positron collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of observed charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ has prompted us to investigate the production rates of the $1^{-+}$ $D\bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_1(2420)$ hadronic molecules, which we refer to as $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$, respectively, in electron-positron collisions. Assuming a hadronic molecular nature for the vector charmonium-like states $\psi(4360)$ and $\psi(4415)$, we evaluate the radiative decay widths of $\psi(4360)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}$ and $\psi(4415)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$. Using these decay widths, we estimate the cross sections for producing $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$ in electron-positron annihilations, as well as the event numbers at the planned Super $\tau$-Charm Facility. Our results suggest that the ideal energy region for observing these states is around $4.44$ and $4.50$ GeV, just above the $D^* \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_2^*(2460)$ thresholds, respectively.</description>

      <title>Triply charmed baryons mass decomposition from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the connected scalar matrix element and the momentum fraction of charm quark within the$\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons on lattice QCD. The results are based on overlap valence fermions on two ensembles of $N_f=2+1$ domain wall fermion configurations with two lattice spacings. The corresponding sea quark pion masses are $300$ MeV and $278$ MeV. The separated contributions to the triply charmed baryon mass are derived through the decomposition of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. The contribution of the connected charm quark matrix element to the triply charmed baryon is about 3/2 times that of the charmonium. And it contributes almost 70% of the total mass. The mass splitting of $\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$triply charmed baryons is mainly from $\langle H_{E}\rangle$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor. A mass decomposition from the quark model is also studied for comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis tests and model parameter estimation on data sets with missing correlation information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22333</link>

Abstract: Ideally, all analyses of normally distributed data should include the full covariance information between all data points. In practice, the full covariance matrix between all data points is not always available. Either because a result was published without a covariance matrix, or because one tries to combine multiple results from separate publications. For simple hypothesis tests, it is possible to define robust test statistics that will behave conservatively in the presence on unknown correlations. For model parameter fits, one can inflate the variance by a factor to ensure that things remain conservative at least up to a chosen confidence level. This paper describes a class of robust test statistics for simple hypothesis tests, as well as an algorithm to determine the necessary inflation factor for model parameter fits and Goodness of Fit tests and composite hypothesis tests. It then presents some example applications of the methods to real neutrino interaction data and model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Bound-state formation and thermalization within the Lindblad approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, as one approach to open quantum systems, describes the density matrix of a particle or a chain of interacting particles, which are in contact with a thermal bath. Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.
  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc.</description>
