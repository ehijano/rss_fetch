      <title>Theory of plasmon spectroscopy with the quantum twisting microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider plasmon-assisted electron tunneling in a quantum twisting microscope (QTM). The dependence of the differential conductance on the two control parameters of the QTM -- the twist angle and bias -- reveals the plasmon spectrum as well as the strength of plasmon-electron interactions in the sample. We perform microscopic calculations for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), to predict the plasmon features in the tunneling spectra of TBG close to the magic angle for different screening environments. Our work establishes a general framework for inelastic tunneling spectroscopy of collective electronic excitations using the quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in the 1/3 plateau state in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic dynamics in InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$ was investigated from the NMR relaxation rate measurement. In InCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_3$, the magnetization isotherm shows a plateau at the 1/3 of full-saturation magnetization, characterizing the 1/3 plateau state. As the 1/3 plateau state appears above 7 T upto 14 T, the microscopic magnetic properties were investigated with the NMR measurement in steady fields. The temperature and field dependence of $1/T_1$ measurement reveals a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum and its evolution with field in the 1/3 plateau state. The field dependence of spin gap provides an important information to understand the microscopic origin of 1/3 plateau state in the kagome antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable topological edge states in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder with balanced perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-site potentials may break the symmetry of a system, resulting in the loss of its original topology protected by the symmetry. In this work, we study the counteracting effect of non-Hermitian terms on real potentials, resulting in dynamically stable topological edge states. We show exactly for a class of systems that the spectrum remains unchanged in the presence of balanced perturbations. As a demonstration, we investigate an extended non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) ladder. We find that the bulk-boundary correspondence still holds, and the zero-energy edge states become coalescing states. In comparison to the original SSH chain, such edge states are robust not only against local perturbations but also in the time domain. As a result, a trivial initial state can always evolve to a stable edge state. Our results provide insights for the application of time-domain stable topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bath parameterization in multi-band cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable algorithms to solve complex impurity problems are instrumental to a routine use of quantum embedding methods for material discovery. In this context, we employ an efficient selected configuration interaction impurity solver to investigate the role of bath discretization -- specifically, bath size and parameterization -- in Hamiltonian-based cluster dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) for the one- and two-orbital Hubbard models. We consider two- and four-site lattices for the single-orbital model and a two-site cluster for the two-orbital model. Our results demonstrate that, for small bath sizes, the choice of parameterization can significantly influence the solution, highlighting the importance of systematic convergence checks. Comparing different bath parameterizations not only reveals the robustness of a given solution but can also provide insights into the nature of different solutions and potential instabilities of the paramagnetic state. We present an extensive analysis of the zero-temperature Mott transition of the paramagnetic half-filled single-band Hubbard model, where we can benchmark with previous literature, and for multi-band models, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and opening the door to systematic studies of multi-orbital systems with the inclusion of non-local effects. Our results show that the dependence on parameterization is strongly reduced for feasible bath sizes in the case of the single-orbital model, while some dependence is still observed for the two-orbital model.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic order in DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet attracts great research interests due to the possibility to realize novel quantum magnetic state such as a quantum spin liquid. Here we present a comprehensive magnetic characterization of DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with ideal two-dimensional triangular lattice. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ exhibits $c$-axis single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Although long-range magnetic order is not observed down to 100 mK under zero field, by applying a small magnetic field ($\sim$0.1 T), a magnetically ordered state with net magnetization of $M_s$/3 below $T_m$=0.14 K is identified ($M_s$ denotes the saturated magnetization). We argue that this state is an up-up-down magnetic structure phase driven by the dipole-dipole interactions between Ising-like spins of Dy$^{3+}$ in a two-dimensional triangular lattice, since its ordering temperature and temperature-field phase diagram can be well explained by the theoretical calculations based on dipolar interactions. DyTa$_7$O$_{19}$ could be viewed as a rare material platform that realizing pure Ising-like dipolar interaction in a geometrically frustrated lattice.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and thermodynamic studies on the distorted kagome magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report specific heat, ac/dc magnetic susceptibility as well as static and pulsed field magnetization studies on the distorted kagome magnet Pr$_3$BWO$_9$ down to 0.4~K and up to high magnetic fields. The low-temperature thermodynamic properties are found to be governed by an electronic quasi-doublet ground state; the energy splitting of which amounts to $\Delta_1\simeq 18$ K and exhibits a quadratic field dependence with $g_\mathrm{eff} = 2.6$. Fitting of the specific heat data implies that the next excited state is strongly gapped at $\Delta_2=430$ K and three-fold degenerate in zero field. Our dc and ac susceptibility studies down to 0.4 K do not detect signatures of distinct spin glass behavior. Pulsed field magnetization measurements up to 60 T confirm the Ising-like paramagnetic nature of the magnetic ground state which is characterized by $m_J=\pm 4$ and the anisotropy energy $E_a\simeq 950$ K.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn): insight into intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides using $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements of the static and dynamic magnetism of $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn), three intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides. Transitions to long-range magnetic order are observed in all three materials and local magnetic fields at muon sites are compared to dipole field calculations. Measurements on Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ capture the evolution of two coexisting magnetic phases. In V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ we observe a peak in the dynamic response at $9$ K, coincident with previous reports of a possible low-temperature phase transition. The observation of high-frequency muon precession in Mn$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ suggests the existence of an additional muon site that implies a difference in electronic energy landscape compared to the other materials in the series. Taken together, this demonstrates that the change in intercalant species drives significant variations in magnetism, highlighting the $M_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, V, Mn) series as an ideal group of materials for investigating a wide range of magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model at quarter filling: An exact diagonalization study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the ground-state phase diagram and topological properties of the spinless 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions at quarter filling. We analyze key physical quantities such as the local electron density distribution, correlation functions for bond-order-wave (BOW) and charge-density-wave (CDW) -- by integrating twisted boundary conditions with the Lanczos technique and employing high-precision numerical diagonalization methods, complemented by a mean-field approximation (MFA) based on bond-order and charge-density modulation analysis. This approach enables precise identification of phase transition critical points. Our results indicate that the system exhibits a topologically trivial band insulating (BI) phase for strong attractive interactions, with its upper boundary forming a downward-opening curve peaking at $V/t\simeq-2.3$ and extending to $V/t\simeq-2.6$. Within $-2.6 \leq V/t \leq -0.5$, a BOW phase emerges for $\left|\delta t/t\right| &gt; 0.45$, with its boundaries converging as $\left|\delta t/t\right|$ decreases, terminating at a single point at $\left|\delta t/t\right|\simeq0.45$. In other parameter regions, a CDW phase is realized. Through this analysis, we elucidate the topological properties of the interacting spinless SSH model at quarter filling, highlighting the competition among CDW, BOW, and BI phases. By tuning $V$ and $\delta t$, the system exhibits diverse correlated phenomena, offering new insights into one-dimensional quantum phase transitions and the interplay between topology and order.</description>

      <title>Competing Interactions and the Effects of Uniaxial Out-of-plane Perturbations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite exhibiting magnetic long-range order below $T_\mathrm{N} = 26.7\,\mathrm{K}$, the honeycomb cobaltate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is predicted to enter a Kitaev spin liquid state when subjected to small external perturbations. While most of the reported literature investigates the effects of magnetic fields applied parallel to the honeycomb layers, we present high-resolution capacitance dilatometry studies for fields perpendicular to the Co-planes up to $15\,\mathrm{T}$. Gr\"uneisen analysis reveals the effect of uniaxial out-of-plane strain and shows that antiferromagnetic order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ is stabilized at a rate of $\partial T_\mathrm{N}/\partial p_\mathrm{c} = 0.28(5)\,\mathrm{K/GPa}$. Further, failure of the Gr\"uneisen scaling at low temperatures around $T_\mathrm{cr} \simeq 7.5\,\mathrm{K}$ demonstrates the presence of competing energy scales. In contrast to an only weak field dependence of the anomaly at $T_\mathrm{N}$, a broad hump at $T_\mathrm{cr}$ ($B=0\,\mathrm{T}$) evolves into a sharp peak at high fields applied $B \parallel c$. Our magnetostriction data show that a kink in the magnetisation at $B_\mathrm{C} \simeq 4.6\,\mathrm{T}$ is accompanied by an inflection point in the field-induced length changes, which is likely related to weak unequal spin canting. All observed phenomena leave their signatures in the magnetoelastic phase diagram as constructed by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>SESaMo: Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation for Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19619v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless deconfinement in super-Coulombic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional "super-Coulombic" plasmas, namely, neutral plasmas with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulomb. To that end, we employ numerically exact large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to naive energy-entropy arguments, we observe a charge confinement-deconfinement transition as a function of temperature. Remarkably, the transition lies in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) universality class. Our results corroborate recent dielectric medium and renormalization group calculations predicting effective long-scale Coulomb interactions in microscopically super-Coulombic gases. We explicitly showcase this novel dielectric screening phenomenon, capturing the emergent Coulomb potential and the associated crossover length scale. This is achieved by utilizing a new test charge based methodology for determining effective inter-particle interactions. Lastly, we show that this Coulomb emergence and the associated BKT transition occur universally across generic interactions and densities.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We find confirmation of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new promising route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Bathing in a sea of candidate quantum spin liquids: From the gapless ruby to the gapped maple-leaf lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the two-dimensional ruby and maple-leaf lattices is emerging as a new paradigmatic model of frustrated quantum magnetism, with the potential to realize intricate many-body phases on both mineral and synthetic platforms. We provide evidence that the generalized model interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum spin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on the maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway. We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the most extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network calculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of the delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states in this family of models.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <title>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</description>

      <title>Competing automorphisms and disordered Floquet codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study disordered Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution -- the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition, showing how key features of the purification dynamics of mixed codestates can be inferred from anyon and automorphism properties for any Abelian topological order. This perspective can explain the protection or measurement of logical information in a dynamic automorphism (DA) code when subjected to a noise model of missing measurements. We demonstrate this using a DA color code with perturbed measurement sequences. The framework of competing automorphisms captures essential features of Floquet codes and robustness to noise, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin-spin interactions of two magnetic impurities in twisted bilayer graphene away from the magic angle. We apply the Bistritzer-MacDonald model of two graphene layers twisted with respect to each other by a small angle. By reducing the model to the Dirac-type one with modified Fermi velocity, we derive expressions for the RKKY quadratic and biquadratic spin interactions using perturbation theory for the free energy. The biquadratic interaction is suppressed by a larger power of the interaction constant and decreases faster with a the distance between impurities comparing to the quadratic one. Nevertheless, due to the different period of oscillations with impurity separation distance, chemical potential, twist angle and temperature, it is possible to fine-tune the system to the regime of dominating biquadratic interaction. The existence of such fine-tuned regime might provide a promising opportunity to observe non-conventional spin ordering.</description>

      <title>Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</description>
