      <title>The information mismatch, and how to fix it</title>

Abstract: We live in unprecedented times in terms of our ability to use evidence to inform medical care. For example, we can perform data-driven post-test probability calculations. However, there is work to do. In current studies, sensitivity and specificity, which play a key role in post-test probability calculations, are defined as unadjusted for patient covariates. In light of this, there have been multiple recommendations that sensitivity and specificity be adjusted for covariates. However, there is less work on the downstream clinical impact of unadjusted sensitivity and specificity. We discuss this here. We argue that unadjusted sensitivity and specificity can lead to a post-test probability that contains an ``information mismatch.'' We write the equations behind such an information mismatch and discuss the steps that can be taken to fix it.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>
