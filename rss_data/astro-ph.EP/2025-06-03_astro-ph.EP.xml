      <title>Three fast-spinning medium-sized Hilda asteroids uncovered by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilda asteroids, which orbit in a 3:2 resonance with Jupiter, serve as key indicators of dynamical processes in the early solar system. Their spin rates, an important probe of these mechanisms, can constrain their density and collisional evolution, offering valuable insights into their origin. In this paper, we report on the identification of three fast-rotating Hilda asteroids with spin periods in the 3.2--3.7 h range using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. These rotation periods are significantly shorter than the previous $\sim$5.0 h shortest rotation periods obtained from ground-based observations in the $\sim$10 km size range, and are comparable with the $\sim$3.0 h breakup limit of Hildas a few km in size, derived from the FOSSIL survey. These fast-rotating asteroids require either considerable cohesion (in the order of a few kPa), or densities $\rho$ $\gtrsim$1.5 $gm^{-3}$, in contrast to the typically assumed $\rho$ $\lesssim$1 $gm^{-3}$, to prevent rotational break-up. C-type asteroids, which are common in the outer main belt, have densities of $\rho$ $\approx$1.5 $gm^{-3}$ and are known to comprise a small but notable fraction of Hildas. The observed occurrence rate of the $\leq$4 h rotation periods may be explained by the 10-15% fraction of C-type asteroids, likely mixed into these populations from the outer main belt during giant planet dynamical interactions in the early solar system.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Mapping of Callisto with HST/STIS and Implications for its Surface Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present global, spatially resolved ultraviolet-visible spectra of Callisto obtained with HST/STIS and explore possible compositions of Callisto's surface material. We map the strength of a widespread downturn toward the near-UV and the NIR spectral slope from 700 to 1000 nm, which varies from slightly blue (reflectance decreasing from 700 to 1000 nm) to red (reflectance increasing) across Callisto's surface. Globally, bright water-ice-rich regions tend to have neutral or blue NIR slopes and a shallower near-UV downturn, while darker material is associated with red NIR slopes and stronger near-UV absorption. Broad absorptions near 820 and 930 nm are spatially correlated with the Asgard and Valhalla impact basins and may be associated with iron-bearing silicates. An absorption edge near 275 nm maps primarily to Callisto's trailing hemisphere, and a 320 nm absorption most prevalent within and surrounding Asgard and Valhalla may be related to organics. We report two new absorption features near 230 and 450 nm which might be attributed to irradiated NaCl. We find little evidence for sulfur-bearing species at UV-visible wavelengths and suggest that a 280 nm band seen only in leading/trailing hemisphere ratio spectra and previously attributed to SO2 is better explained as a consequence of dividing the unrelated 320 nm leading hemisphere band by the trailing hemisphere 275 nm absorption edge. Spatial variations in spectral features suggest that Callisto's dark material composition varies regionally, reflecting a mix of endogenic and exogenic sources and radiolytic alteration.</description>

      <title>Pluto Geologic Map: Use of Crater Data to Understand Age Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pluto's surface displays a wide variety of geologic units from smooth plains to extremely rugged mountainous expanses. These terrains range in age from young, actively resurfaced regions (no observable craters even in the highest-resolution New Horizons images) to old, heavily cratered, eroded regions. Here we expand upon the crater data analysis and the independent crater data set used in the production of a 1:7M scale geologic map of Pluto that is to be published by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS). We present both relative ages based on crater spatial density (number of craters in a given size bin per km^2) and also quantitative ages (e.g., 2 Ga) using the estimated impactor flux onto Pluto. The techniques presented here were developed specifically for the information available from a USGS geologic map, where smaller craters are mapped as points only (no specific diameter information per crater). We developed a new type of visualization, called a distributed R-plot, to understand the relative ages of the geologic units. The uncertainties in the current knowledge of the Kuiper belt populations and impactor flux at Pluto propagate to large uncertainties in the estimated quantitative ages (~a factor of two). However, both relative and quantitative ages from crater analysis were still valuable tools in developing the sequence of geologic events. Pluto has large areas of crater-free young terrains (13 units making up ~27% of mapped higher-resolution surface area), with widely varying morphologies, indicating a variety of resurfacing mechanisms, both exogenic and endogenic, likely active into Pluto's recent past or present.</description>

      <title>Star-Planet Interactions: A Computational View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several physical processes that mediate the interaction between an exoplanet and its host star, with the four main ones being due to magnetic, particle (stellar outflow), radiative and tidal interactions. These interactions can be observed at different wavelengths, from X-ray to radio. Their strengths depend on the architecture of planetary systems, as well as the age and activity level of the host stars. In particular, exoplanets in close-in orbits and/or orbiting active host stars can experience strong physical interactions, some of which are negligible or absent in the present-day Solar System planets. Here, I present an overview of star-planet interactions through the lens of three-dimensional (3D) numerical models. The main conclusions are:
  * Models are fundamental to interpret and guide observations. The powerful combination of observations and models allows us to extract important physical parameters of the system, such as, planetary magnetic fields, stellar wind properties, etc.
  * The non-axisymmetric forces of the interactions generate spatially asymmetric features (e.g., planetary material trailing the orbit, shock formation), thus requiring the use of 3D models.
  * Star-planet interactions vary in different timescales (from hours to giga-years) that are related to both planetary (orbital motion, rotation) and stellar (flares, cycles, and long-term evolution) properties. Understanding these variations require time-dependent models.
  I advocate that future 3D models should be informed by multi-wavelength, (near-)simultaneous observations. The use of observations is twofold: some generate inputs for models (eg stellar magnetic field maps), whereas others are fitted by models (eg spectroscopic transits). This combination of observations and models provides a powerful tool to derive physical properties of the system that would otherwise remain unknown.</description>

      <title>On Linking Planet Formation Models, Protoplanetary Disk Properties, and Mature Gas Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring a single elemental ratio (e.g., carbon-to-oxygen) provides insufficient information for understanding the formation mechanisms and evolution that affect our observations of gas giant planet atmospheres. Although the fields of planet formation, protoplanetary disks, and exoplanets are well established and interconnected, our understanding of how to self-consistently and accurately link the theoretical and observational aspects of these fields together is lacking. To foster interdisciplinary conversations, the Max-Planck Institut f\"ur Astronomie (MPIA) hosted a week-long workshop called, "Challenge Accepted: Linking Planet Formation with Present-Day Atmospheres." Here, we summarize the latest theories and results in planet formation modeling, protoplanetary disk observations, and atmospheric observations of gas giant atmospheres to address one of the challenges of hosting interdisciplinary conferences: ensuring everyone is aware of the state-of-the-art results and technical language from each discipline represented. Additionally, we highlight key discussions held at the workshop. Our main conclusion is that it is unclear what the ideal observable is to make this link between formation scenarios and exoplanet atmospheres, whether it be multiple elemental abundance ratios, measuring refractory budgets, or something else. Based on discussions held throughout the workshop, we provide several key takeaways of what the workshop attendees feel need the most improvement and exploration within each discipline.</description>

      <title>NLTE atmospheric modelling of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b and comparison with UV and optical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-178b accounting for NLTE effects and compare synthetic transmission spectra with NUV and optical observations. We use the HELIOS code (LTE) in the lower and the Cloudy code (LTE or NLTE) in the middle and upper atmosphere to compute the temperature-pressure (TP) and abundance profiles. We further use Cloudy to compute the theoretical planetary transmission spectrum both in LTE and NLTE for comparison with observations. We find an isothermal TP profile at pressures higher than 10 mbar and lower than 10$^{-8}$ bar, with an almost linear increase from about 2200 K to about 8100 K in between. The temperature structure is driven by NLTE effects, particularly in the form of increased heating resulting from the overpopulation of long-lived FeII levels with strong transitions in the NUV band, where the stellar emission is strong, and of decreased cooling due to the underpopulation of MgI and MgII levels that dominate the cooling. The planetary atmosphere is hydrostatic up to pressures of about 1 nbar, and thus accurately modelling spectral lines forming at pressures lower than about 1 nbar requires accounting for both hydrodynamics and NLTE effects. The NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum overestimates the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ absorption, while the LTE model is in good agreement, which is surprising as the opposite has been found for the other UHJs for which NLTE modelling has been performed. Instead, in the NUV we find an excellent match between the NLTE transmission spectrum and the HST/UVIS data, contrary to the LTE model. This contrasts previous LTE results requiring SiO absorption to fit the observations. The accurate characterisation of the atmosphere of UHJs is possible only accounting for NLTE effects, and particularly for the level population of Fe and Mg, which dominate heating and cooling, respectively.</description>

      <title>SiO and a super-stellar C/O ratio in the atmosphere of the giant exoplanet WASP-121b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory elements such as iron, magnesium, and silicon can be detected in the atmospheres of ultrahot giant planets. This provides an opportunity to quantify the amount of refractory material accreted during formation, along with volatile gases and ices. However, simultaneous detections of refractories and volatiles have proved challenging, as the most prominent spectral features of associated atoms and molecules span a broad wavelength range. Here, using a single JWST observation of the ultrahot giant planet WASP-121b, we report detections of H$_2$O (5.5-13.5$\sigma$), CO (10.8-12.8$\sigma$), and SiO (5.7-6.2$\sigma$) in the planet's dayside atmosphere, and CH$_4$ (3.1-5.1$\sigma$) in the nightside atmosphere. We measure super-stellar values for the atmospheric C/H, O/H, Si/H, and C/O ratios, which point to the joint importance of pebbles and planetesimals in giant planet formation. The CH$_4$-rich nightside composition is also indicative of dynamical processes, such as strong vertical mixing, having a profound influence on the chemistry of ultrahot giant planets.</description>

      <title>A Precise Metallicity and Carbon-to-Oxygen Ratio for a Warm Giant Exoplanet from its Panchromatic JWST Emission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-80 b, a warm sub-Jovian (equilibrium temperature ~820 K, 0.5 Jupiter masses), presents an opportunity to characterize a rare gas giant exoplanet around a low-mass star. In addition, its moderate temperature enables its atmosphere to host a range of carbon and oxygen species (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, NH$_3$). In this paper, we present a panchromatic emission spectrum of WASP-80 b, the first gas giant around a late K/early M-dwarf star and the coolest planet for which the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a complete emission spectrum spanning 2.4-12 $\mu$m, including NIRCam F322W2 (2.4-4 $\mu$m) and F444W (4-5 $\mu$m), and MIRI LRS (5-12 $\mu$m). We report confident detections of H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, and CO$_2$, and a tentative detection of NH$_3$. We estimate WASP-80 b's atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio and compare them with estimates for other gas giants. Despite the relative rarity of giant planets around low-mass stars, we find that WASP-80 b's composition is consistent with other hot gas giants, suggesting that the formation pathway of WASP-80 b may not be dissimilar from hot gas giants around higher-mass stars.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of Organics Detection and Characterization on the Surface of Europa with Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organics, if they do exist on Europa, may only be present in trace amounts on the surface. NASA's upcoming mission Europa Clipper is going to provide global, high quality data of the surface of Europa in the near-infrared (NIR), specifically the 3-5~$\mu$m region, where organics are rich in spectroscopic features. In this work we investigate Europa Clipper's ability to constrain the abundance of selected trace species of interest that span different chemical bonds found in organics, such as C-H, C=C, C$\equiv$C, C=O and C$\equiv$N, via NIR spectroscopy in the 3-5~$\mu$m wavelength region. We simulate reflectance spectra of these trace species mixed with water ice, at varying SNR and abundance fractions. The evidence for the trace species in a mixture is evaluated using two approaches: 1) calculating average strength of absorption feature(s), and 2) Bayesian model comparison (BMC) analysis. Our simulations show that sharp and strong spectroscopic features of trace ($\sim 5\%$ abundance by number) organic species should be detectable at $&gt; 3\sigma$ significance in Europa Clipper quality data. A BMC analysis pushes the $3\sigma$ detection threshold of trace species even lower to $&lt;1 \%$ abundance. We also consider an example with all trace species mixed together, with overlapping features, and BMC is able to retrieve strong evidence for all of them and also provide constraints on their abundance. These results are promising for Europa Clipper's capability to detect trace organic species, which would allow correlations to be drawn between the composition and geological regions with possibly endogenic material.</description>

      <title>AGNI: A radiative-convective model for lava planet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is important that we are able to accurately model the atmospheres of (exo)planets. This is because atmospheres play a central role in setting a planet's thermochemical environment at a given point in time, and also in regulating how it evolves over geological timescales. Additionally, it is primarily by observation of their atmospheres that we are able to characterise exoplanets. There is particular demand for accurate models in the context of so-called lava worlds: planets with molten interiors (or `magma oceans').
  AGNI is a Julia program designed to solve for the temperature and radiation environment within the atmospheres of rocky (exo)planets. It leverages a well established FORTRAN code to calculate radiative fluxes from a given atmospheric temperature structure and composition, which -- alongside representations of convection and other processes -- enables an energy-conserving numerical solution for the atmospheric conditions. In contrast to most other numerical atmosphere models, AGNI uses a Newton-Raphson optimisation method to obtain its solution, which enables improved performance and scalability. Our model was specifically developed for use alongside planetary interior models within a coupled simulation framework. However, it can also be applied to scientific problems standalone when used as an executable program; it reads TOML configuration files and outputs figures and NetCDF datasets. AGNI can also function as a software library; it is used in this sense within the Jupyter notebook tutorials of our GitHub repository (https://nichollsh.github.io/AGNI/dev/)</description>

      <title>Should We Expect Further Acceleration of the Earth's Rotation in the Coming Years?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested in the literature that the difference between universal and coordinated time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in the coming years (Agnew 2024). This would make it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into UTC for the first time in history, which in turn will cause serious problems in time keeping and synchronization systems around the world. Based on the latest Earth's rotation and universal time data published by the international Earth rotation and reference systems service (IERS) and their prediction, in this paper, we have shown that the acceleration trend observed over the past four years is likely to return to slowing down soon. Therefore, fears about the possible need to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC time scale in the next few years in the light of recent observational data have seen unfounded.</description>

Abstract: Brown dwarfs provide a unique opportunity to study atmospheres and their physical and chemical processes with high precision, especially in temperature ranges relevant to exoplanets. In this study, we performed high-resolution ($R \sim 70,000$) spectroscopy using Subaru/IRD ($Y$, $J$, $H$-bands) of the T7.0p-type object Gl 229 B, the first discovered T-type brown dwarf, which orbits an M1V host star at a separation of 33 au. We conducted atmospheric retrieval on the reduced $H$-band spectrum using the high-resolution spectrum model compatible with automatic differentiation and GPU, ExoJAX. In contrast to previous retrieval studies on medium-resolution spectra, we obtained a C/O ratio consistent with that of the host star, aligning with the expected formation process for such a massive brown dwarf. Additionally, based on the strong constraint on temperature from the high-resolution spectrum and previously measured photometric magnitude, our analysis indicates that Gl 229 B is a binary, which was also proposed by Brandt et al. (2021) and recently confirmed by Xuan et al. (2024). Finally, we validated current molecular line lists by leveraging the obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of this warm ($\sim 900$ K) atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of observing companion brown dwarfs as benchmark objects for establishing characterization techniques for low-mass objects and enhancing our understanding of their atmospheres, given the wealth of available information and the relative ease of observation.</description>

Abstract: Complete, accurate, and precise catalogues of exoplanet host star (EHS) properties are essential to deriving high-quality exoplanet parameters. This paper aims at homogeneously parameterising EHS and their exoplanets, using Gaia and GSP-spec data. For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no prior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions, kinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556 exoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff, L*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more precise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty; this reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer analysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation valley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS population is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties, although they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral arm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo members have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp increases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy between dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more massive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets are more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies that the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus, with dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]&gt;~1.5 times Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic catalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and precise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.</description>

      <title>A 1.48-2.48 $\mathrm{\mu}$m R=28000 spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the nearest pair of brown dwarfs: Luhman 16AB</title>

Abstract: We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.</description>
