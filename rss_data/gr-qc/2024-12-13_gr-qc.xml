      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>

      <title>Metric as Emergence of Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This set of notes guided a 2 hour lecture on "Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Fundamental Fields for the New Horizons for Psi School and Workshop", hosted at Instituto Superior Tecnico, University of Lisbon, between 1 - 5 July 2024. It introduces how to model asymmetric mass-ratio binaries evolving while immersed in an environment constituted by an ultralight (complex) scalar field using techniques of black hole perturbation theory, and focusing on the simpler example of a spherically symmetric cloud around a non-rotating black hole. A Mathematica notebook with the derivation and solver of the equations of motion of the system is also provided.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers quantify the conservative static response of compact objects to external tidal fields, and are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. Many aspects of the physics of black holes have an analogue in the theory of supersonic acoustic flows, including the existence of an event horizon and associated phenomena, such as quasinormal modes and superradiance. In this paper, we investigate the tidal Love numbers of acoustic black holes in different number of dimensions. We find that they exhibit a number of similar properties as higher-dimensional general relativistic black holes, such as logarithmic running with radial distance, and vanishing tidal response for special multipole moments. We show that the latter is a consequence of ladder symmetries, analogous to those identified for black holes.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled quintessential inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses the dynamics of early-time cosmic inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration within the context of a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. By employing an exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic plateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small field values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. We derive the inflationary predictions for the spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with current observational constraints. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark energy component with an equation of state $w_\phi$ approaching $-1$ but retaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational signature. This work demonstrates that a single theoretical framework can reconcile both early inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Zero Mass limit of Kerr-MOG Black Hole Equals Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been argued in existing literature that the zero mass limit of Kerr spacetime corresponds to either flat Minkowski spacetime or a wormhole exhibiting a locally flat geometry. In this study, we examine that the zero mass limit of the Kerr-MOG black hole is equivalent to a wormhole. Moreover, we derive the Kerr-Schild form of the Kerr-MOG black hole through specific coordinate transformations. We further investigate the physical and topological characteristics of the Kerr-MOG black hole within the framework of modified gravity. Our analysis also includes a discussion of the wormhole using cylindrical coordinates, which comprises two distinct coordinate patches. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the Kerr-Newman black hole and show that the \emph{zero mass limit of the Kerr-Newman black hole does not yield a wormhole}. However, if we impose an additional criterion such that \emph{both the mass parameter and the charge parameters are equal to zero}, then the Kerr-Newman black hole will be a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbations on the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane and $\sigma_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time. For that purpose we first constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$ and $M$ by means of the Pantheon+ catalog and a mock catalog of gravitational waves. Then, we solve numerically the equation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling solution for the master equation and assuming that $p=4$ for the matter dominated era. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density perturbations in both branches is different from the $\Lambda$CDM model and that the value of $\sigma_8=0.774\pm0.027$ for the normal branch and $\sigma_8=0.913\pm0.032$ for the self-accelerating branch.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a natural, mathematically consistent definition of the essential (highest possible) regularity of an affine connection -- a geometric property independent of atlas -- together with a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether connections are at their essential regularity. This condition is based on the relative regularity between the connection and its Riemann curvature. Based on this, we prove that authors' theory of the RT-equations provides a computable procedure for constructing coordinate transformations which simultaneously lift connection and curvature components to essential regularity, and lift the atlas of coordinate charts to the regularity required to preserve the essential regularity of the connection. This provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in a geometry are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. The theory applies to general affine connections with components in $L^p$, $p&gt;n$, which naturally includes shock wave singularities in General Relativity as well as continuous metrics with infinite gradients, (both obstacles to numerical simulation), but not yet singularities at the lower regularity $p\leq n$ associated with discontinuous metric components, for example, the event horizon of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Probing Spacetime Symmetries Using Gravitational Wave Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uniqueness and rigidity theorems assert that the asymptotically flat, vacuum, stationary rotating black hole solution in general relativity must be the Kerr solution, exhibiting novel symmetries such as axisymmetry and circularity. In our analysis of post-merger ringdown signal from coalescing black hole binary systems, we identify potential observational signatures for deviations from these Kerr symmetries. Utilizing ringdown data from the gravitational wave event GW150914, we place significant constraints on such deviations. Our analysis introduces a new and novel approach for testing spacetime symmetries through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Torsion, Extrinsic Torsion, and the Hubble Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intrinsic and extrinsic torsions (defined by analogy with the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures) of the spatial sections of torsional spacetimes. We consider two possibilities. First, that the intrinsic torsion might prove to be directly observable. Second, that it is not observable, having been ``inflated away'' in the early Universe. We argue that, even in this second case, the extrinsic torsion may grow during the inflationary era and be non-negligible at reheating and thereafter. Even if the spatial intrinsic curvature and torsion are too small to be detected directly, then, the extrinsic torsion might not be. We point out that, if its presence is not recognised, the extrinsic torsion could lead to anomalies in the theoretical estimate of the Hubble parameter, a result with obvious potential applications. We stress that extrinsic torsion is by far the most natural way to produce such anomalies, simply because it mixes naturally with the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence -- II: Quasinormal modes and Chaos Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quasinormal modes and chaotic phenomena associated with the Frolov black hole in the presence of a quintessence field. We investigated the effects of a quintessence field on quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the chaos bound of circular photon orbits. The obtained results on the QNM shows that increasing the magnitude of the quintessence parameter causes the scalar perturbations to decay at a slower rate. Furthermore, as the equation of state of the quintessence field grows, i.e. from $w = -4/9$ to $ - 2/3$, the damping increases. We also examined the chaos bound, $\tilde{\lambda}^2 - \kappa^2$, of photon orbits and observed that it violates for lower photon orbit radii and larger angular momentum values. These violation in the strong-field regime implies the onset of chaotic behaviour in the vicinity of the BHs and signify the importance of the quintessence field in photon geodesics.</description>

      <title>Barrow holographic dark energy: a path to reconstructing $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the established methods for reconstructing modified gravity models from a dark energy model, with the aim of discovering relationships between these theories. In this study, we focus on the $f(R,T)$ modified gravity theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We employ Barrow's holographic dark energy model, derived from fractal surfaces of black holes, to investigate the reconstruction process. The numerical results are subsequently presented for various infrared cutoffs, such as the Hubble horizon, future event horizon, and Granda-Oliveros cutoff.</description>

      <title>On M87$^*$ and SgrA$^*$ Observational Constraints of Dunkl Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a new black hole recently obtained from the Dunkl operator formalism involving a relevant parameter denoted by $\xi$. Concretely, we first investigate the shadows, the Lyapunov exponents of unstable nearly bound orbits and the spherically infalling accretion behaviors in terms of such a parameter. Then, we examine the effect of this parameter on the Dunkl black hole deflection angle in vacuum and medium backgrounds by manipulating the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
  Exploiting the M87$^*$ and SgrA$^*$ optical bonds, we provide strong constraints on $\xi$ via the falsification mechanism.</description>

      <title>Wormhole geometries in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate traversable wormhole spacetimes within the context of a covariant generalization of Einstein's General Relativity, namely the energy-momentum squared gravity, denoted as $f\left(R,T_{ab}T^{ab}\right)$. Here, $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T_{ab}$ is the energy-momentum tensor. Specifically considering the linear form $f\left(R,T_{ab}T^{ab}\right)=R+\gamma T_{ab}T^{ab}$, we demonstrate the existence of numerous wormhole solutions, wherein the matter fields satisfy all energy conditions, these being the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. Remarkably, these solutions do not require fine-tuning of the free parameters inherent to the model. Given the complicated nature of the field equations, we develop an analytical recursive algorithm to derive these solutions. One limitation is that these solutions lack natural localization, necessitating then a matching with an external vacuum spacetime. To address this, we derive the junction conditions for the theory, establishing that any matching between two spacetimes must be smooth, i.e. without the presence of thin-shells at the boundary. Ultimately, applying these junction conditions allows us to match the interior wormhole spacetime with an exterior vacuum described by the Schwarzschild solution. Therefore, we obtain traversable, localized, static, and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions that satisfy all energy conditions across the entire spacetime range. Additionally, we demonstrate that the approach used in this study can be easily generalized to more complicated dependencies of the action on $T_{ab}T^{ab}$, provided there are no crossed terms between $R$ and $T_{ab}T^{ab}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for the Schwartzschild black hole are studied from the viewpoint of the particle scattering under an effective Regge-Wheeler type of potential consisting of a parabolic type one in an intermediate region and flat potentials on both sides. In particular, we use the eigenstates for a reversed harmonic oscillator as the complete bases in this intermediate region. Under this setting, the transmission and reflection coefficients are studied in addition to the frequencies of QNMs.</description>

      <title>Properties of interacting quark star in light of Rastall gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the properties of quark stars (QS) formulated with an interacting quark matter equation of state (EoS) within the framework of Rastall gravity, a modified theory of gravity. We derive the mass-radius relationships and calculate the maximum gravitational masses and their corresponding radii, comparing these results under both Rastall gravity and general relativity. Our analysis incorporates recent observational data, including the GW190425 event, to constrain the model parameters ($\bar{\lambda}, \eta, B_{\rm eff}$). We also assess the stability of these quark stars by evaluating their static stability, adiabatic index, and sound velocity profiles, thus confirming their viability within the modified gravitational framework.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from a relativistic jet induced by a plane gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic radiation of a relativistic gas or plasma jet in the field of a plane gravitational wave is investigated. The gravitational wave is considered as a weak (linearized) field on flat Minkowski spacetime. It is assumed that the relativistic jet has large regions with uncompensated electric charge. The deformation of these areas under the action of a gravitational wave leads to the appearance of electric currents that generate electromagnetic radiation. The angular distribution of the intensity of this radiation is found. Cases are considered when the jet and the gravitational wave move in the same direction or towards each other.</description>

      <title>Propagating degrees of freedom on maximally-symmetric backgrounds in $f(R)$ theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of $f(R)$ gravity, as well as other extended theories of gravity, the correct counting of globally well-defined dynamical modes has recently drawn a vivid interest. In this communication we present a consistent approach shedding light on such issues for both so-called degenerate and non-degenerate $f(R)$ models embedded in maximally-symmetric backgrounds. We find that the linearised spectrum of degenerate models on these backgrounds is empty, lacking both the graviton and scalaron modes which appear in generic non-degenerate models. Our work generalises previous results in the literature applicable only to the specific (degenerate) model $f(R)=\alpha R^2$; in fact, we find that the same pathologies discovered therein emerge for all choices of $f(R)$ belonging to the wide class of degenerate models.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a recently developed spectral method to obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity and apply it to the black holes of shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this theory the quasinormal modes were recently obtained by employing perturbation theory in quadratic order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Here we present the full non-perturbative results for the spectrum within the domain of existence of rotating black holes and compare with the perturbative results. We also compare with the quasinormal mode spectrum of rapidly rotating Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity/Dynamical Dark Energy vs $\Lambda$CDM: is the game over?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decades, tests on the standard model of cosmology, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM model, have been widely analysed and compared with many different models for describing dark energy. Modified gravities have played an important role in this sense as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM model. Previous observational data has been always favouring $\Lambda$CDM model in comparison to any other model. While statistically speaking, alternative models have shown tehir power, fitting in some cases the observational data slightly better than $\Lambda$CDM, the significance and goodness of the fits were not significantly relevant to exclude the standard model of cosmology. In this paper, a generalisation of exponential $F(R)$ gravity is considered and compared with $\Lambda$CDM model by using the latest observational data. Also some well-known model independent parameterisations for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy are explored. These scenarios are confronted with the renewed observational data involving the Pantheon plus datasets of supernovae type Ia, the Hubble parameter estimations, data from the cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations, where the latter includes the data provided by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument collaboration. Results of this analysis suggest that standard exponential $F(R)$ models provide much better fits than $\Lambda$CDM model, which is excluded at 4$\sigma$. Moreover, the parameterisations of the equation of state suggest a non-constant EoS parameter for dark energy, where $\Lambda$CDM model is also excluded at 4$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quasinormal modes and asymptotic tails of regular Schwarzschild-like black holes in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of perturbations of a (charged) massive scalar field near a regular Simpson-Visser black hole, allowing for a non-zero external magnetic field. We show that the damping rate of the quasinormal frequencies is strongly suppressed by both the magnetic field and the mass term, with indications that arbitrarily long-lived modes, or quasi-resonances, may exist in the spectrum. In the time domain, the quasinormal ringing transitions into slowly decaying oscillatory tails, which are qualitatively distinct from the massive tails observed in the absence of a magnetic field. For nonzero multipole and azimuthal numbers, the power-law envelope characteristic of cases without a magnetic field transforms into an oscillatory envelope that cannot be easily fitted with a simple analytical formula.</description>

      <title>The Interconnection of Cosmological Constant and Renyi Entropy in Kalb-Ramond Black Holes : Insights from Thermodynamic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to establish a connection between the cosmological constant and Renyi entropy within the framework of Kalb-Raymond(K-R) gravity. Our analysis is supported by evidence showing the equivalence of the thermodynamic topology of K-R AdS black holes in the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistical framework and K-R flat black holes in the Renyi statistical framework. We begin by exploring the thermodynamic topology of K-R black holes in flat spacetimes, focusing on the topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in both statistical frameworks. We find that K-R flat black holes in Renyi statistics exhibit equivalent global and local topological properties to K-R AdS black holes in GB statistics. This equivalence points to a potential connection between the cosmological constant and the Renyi parameter. We derive an approximate relationship between the Renyi parameter and the cosmological constant, which is consistent with similar findings in the literature from a cosmological perspective.</description>

      <title>Discretely self-similar exterior-naked singularities for the Einstein-scalar field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of constructing naked singularities in general relativity can be naturally divided into two parts: (i) the construction of the region exterior to the past light cone of the singularity, extending all the way to (an incomplete) future null infinity and yielding the nakedness property (what we will call exterior-naked singularity regions); (ii) attaching an interior fill-in that ensures that the singularity arises from regular initial data. This problem has been resolved for the spherically symmetric Einstein-scalar field system by Christodoulou, but his construction, based on a continuously self-similar ansatz, requires that both the exterior and the interior regions are mildly irregular on the past cone of the singularity. On the other hand, numerical works suggest that there exist naked singularity spacetimes with discrete self-similarity arising from smooth initial data. In this paper, we revisit part (i) of the problem and we construct exterior-naked singularity regions with discretely self-similar profiles which are smooth on the past cone of the singularity. We show that the scalar field remains uniformly bounded, but the singularity is characterized by the infinite oscillations of the scalar field and the mass aspect ratio. (Our examples require however that the mass aspect ratio is uniformly small, and thus the solutions are distinct from the exterior regions of the numerical examples.) It remains an open problem to smoothly attach interior fill-ins as in (ii) to our solutions, which would yield a new construction of naked singularity spacetimes, now arising from smooth initial data.</description>

      <title>Hidden gauge invariances of torsion theories: closed algebras and absence of ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possible affine gauge transformations of the torsion tensor that make up Lie algebras. We find two such non-trivial structures, in which the gauge parameters are a $2$-form and a scalar. The first one gives rise to a non-abelian Lie algebra that is isomorphic to the Lorentz algebra, and which commutes with the latter. By linearizing this new gauge transformation we single out the gauge-invariant field variables on a flat background. Then, taking into account the most general power-counting renormalizable action of the torsion and imposing gauge invariance, we are able to find an invariant action that only has two free parameters. The torsion field equations of the resulting action are compatible with General Relativity in the torsionfree limit. Then, employing the spin-parity decompositions and the path integral method, we show that the theory, supplemented by the higher-derivative and Einstein-Hilbert actions, is free from kinematical ghosts, while it has a tachyonic scalar mode. Eventually, we comment on the technical difficulties that one will encounter when calculating the divergent part of the $1$-loop effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an instance in quantum gravity where a topological expansion resums into an effective description on a single geometry. The original theory whose gravitational path integral we study is JT quantum gravity with one asymptotic boundary at nonperturbatively low temperatures. The effective theory we derive is a deformation of JT gravity by a highly quantum and nonlocal interaction for the dilaton, evaluated only on a disk topology. This emergent description addresses a strongly quantum gravitational regime where all genera contribute at the same order, successfully capturing the doubly nonperturbative physics of the original theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish a version of the Bartnik Splitting Conjecture in the context of Lorentzian length spaces. In precise terms, we show that under an appropriate timelike completeness condition, a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length space of the form $\Sigma\times \mathbb{R}$ with $\Sigma$ compact splits as a metric Lorentzian product, provided it has non negative timelike curvature bounds. This is achieved by showing that the causal boundary of that Lorentzian length space consists on a single point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on two linear interaction models between dark matter and dark energy, which are proposed as key factors in explaining cosmic history, specifically the latetime accelerating expansion of the universe. Both models are constrained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using different sets of observational data. The analysis was composed using the Pantheon data set, consisting of 1048 points of SNIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon analysis and the Observed Hubble Parameter (OHD) data set using Baryon acoustic Oscillation (BAO), consisting of 57 data points using distance and expansion rate measurement. Both models showed promising results with the OHD data (BAO), with a interaction that results in a higher dark matter content of 56% and 44%, and a Hubble parameter of 65.7+-3km/ s/Mpc and 65.8+-3km/ s/Mpc for the interaction dependent on dark matter and dark energy respectively. The pantheon data set however predicted a reverse interaction for both models which does not follow initial assumptions that were made. The pantheon data measured a dark matter content of 18% and 20% with a Hubble parameter of 72.1 +- 0.003km/ s/Mpc and 72.3 +- 0.004km /s/Mpc. The constrained results are used to revisit the coincidence problem and other problems in standard cosmology. The analysis provided a discrepancy between the different data sets with one having a large error margin.</description>

      <title>DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological ``wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT's exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.</description>

      <title>Is cosmological data suggesting a nonminimal coupling between matter and gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample and the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to constrain the modified model's parameters and to compare its fit quality to the Flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a self-consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field in both Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. This approach utilizes a general formalism to analyze the evolution of Gaussian states of a quantized field, in the Schrodinger picture in the presence of a background electric field. We numerically solve the resulting nonlinear equations using initial data that consists of a Gaussian scalar field state. This provides a self-consistent semiclassical evolution incorporating the non-perturbative backreaction from particle production. We study the time-dependent particle content, current density, and electric field, which are defined in terms of the concept of instantaneous eigenstates, and describe how they capture the time evolution of the quantized field modes. We then compare the results with and without backreaction in flat and cosmological de Sitter spacetime, finding that the backreaction significantly alters particle production in both cases.</description>

Abstract: We devise a novel duality sequence to study late-time cosmology in the heterotic E_8 x E_8 setup of Horava and Witten with dynamical walls that are moving towards each other. Surprisingly, we find that the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory does not violate NEC and therefore we do not see either a bouncing or an ekpyrotic phase. Instead, our four-dimensional setup shows a transient de Sitter phase that lies well within the trans-Planckian bound. This opens up a myriad of possibilities of addressing both phenomenological and cosmological issues, and here we concentrate on one such interesting model, an axionic cosmology with temporally varying axionic coupling.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) predicted by pre-big-bang (PBB) cosmology using data from the first three observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. PBB cosmology proposes an alternative to cosmic inflation where the Universe evolves from a weak-coupling, low-curvature state to the hot Big Bang through a high-curvature bounce phase, predicting a distinctive SGWB spectrum. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the cross-correlation data to constrain the model parameters characterizing the PBB spectrum. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model, strongly favoring the noise-only hypothesis. Our analysis establishes a lower bound $\beta \gtrsim -0.19$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which is compatible with the theoretical requirement $\beta \geq 0$ for a smooth bounce transition. While we do not detect a signal, our constraints remain consistent with the basic theoretical framework of PBB cosmology, demonstrating the potential of gravitational-wave observations to test early Universe theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially chiral stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can arise from various processes in the early Universe. The gravitational ABJ anomaly links the chirality of the gravitational field to the chiral fermions, resulting in the stochastic generation of fermionic matter in the radiation era. We show that this mechanism can account for the entire dark matter relic density and discuss its potential as a leptogenesis scenario to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Remarkably, this letter reveals that even if gravitational waves become unpolarized later, their temporary chirality during their generation process leaves a lasting imprint on the fermionic matter, preserved as a quantum remnant.</description>

We cover the techniques to perform the exact gravitational path integral of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity, and supergravity, over spacetimes with arbitrary topology, with an application to black holes. We discuss the connection with random matrix models and moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces briefly, since those concepts were covered in other lectures of the school.</description>

      <title>Black Mirrors: CPT-Symmetric Alternatives to Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equations imply that a gravitationally collapsed object forms an event horizon. But what lies on the other side of this horizon? In this paper, we question the reality of the conventional solution (the black hole), and point out another, topologically distinct solution: the \textit{black mirror}. In the black hole solution, the horizon connects the exterior metric to an interior metric which contains a curvature singularity. In the black mirror, the horizon instead connects the exterior metric to its own CPT mirror image, yielding a solution with no curvature singularities. We give the general stationary (charged, rotating) black mirror solution explicitly, and also describe the general black mirror formed by gravitational collapse. The black mirror is the relevant stationary point when the quantum path integral is equipped with suitably CPT-symmetric boundary conditions, that we propose. It appears to avoid many vexing puzzles which plague the conventional black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One regime where we might see departures from general relativity is at the largest accessible scales, with a natural choice in cosmology being the cosmological horizon (or Hubble) scale. We investigate a single-parameter extension to the standard cosmological model with a different strength of gravity above and below this scale -- a "cosmic glitch" in gravity. Cosmic microwave background observations, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (including the recent DESI Y1) favour weaker superhorizon gravity, at nearly a percent (or 2$\sigma$ level), easing both the Hubble and clustering tensions with other cosmological data. This compounds evidence for an even stronger glitch during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (from helium abundance observations), suggesting that symmetries of general relativity are maximally violated at the Big Bang, but gradually recovered as we approach the present-day cosmological de Sitter scale, associated with the observed dark energy.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter, ultralight scalars, and cosmic neutrinos with gyroscope spin and precision clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) within the solar system induces deviations in the geodetic drift of gyroscope spin due to its gravitational interaction. Assuming a constant DM density as a minimal scenario, we constrain DM overdensity within the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) orbit and project limits for Earth's and Neptune's orbits around the Sun. The presence of electrons in gravitating sources and test objects introduces a scalar-mediated Yukawa potential, which can be probed using terrestrial and space--based precision clocks. We derive projected DM overdensity $(\eta)$ limits from Sagnac time measurements using onboard satellite clocks, highlighting their dependence on the source mass and orbital radius. The strongest limit, $\eta\lesssim 4.45\times 10^3$, is achieved at Neptune's orbit ($\sim 30~\mathrm{AU}$), exceeding existing constraints. Correspondingly, the cosmic neutrino overdensity is bounded as $\xi\lesssim 5.34\times 10^{10}$, surpassing results from KATRIN and cosmic ray studies. The best limit on electrophilic scalar coupling is $g\lesssim 7.09\times 10^{-24}$ for scalar mass $m_\varphi\lesssim 1.32\times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$ competitive with existing fifth-force bounds. These precision measurements offer a robust framework for testing gravity at solar system scales and probing DM in scenarios inaccessible to direct detection experiments.</description>

Abstract: The theory of gravity with a quadratic contribution of scalar curvature is investigated using a dynamical systems approach. The simplest Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric is employed to formulate the dynamics in both the Jordan frame and the conformally transformed Einstein frame. We show that, in both frames, there are stable de Sitter states where the expansion of the Hubble function naturally includes terms corresponding to an effective dark matter component. Using the invariant center manifold, we demonstrate that, in the Einstein frame, there exists a zero-measure set of initial conditions that lead from an unstable to a stable de Sitter state. Additionally, the initial de Sitter state is associated with a parallelly propagated singularity. We show that the formulations of the theory in the Jordan frame and the Einstein frame are physically nonequivalent.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological gravitational waveform model of binary black holes incorporating horizon fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17554v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subjected to the tidal field of its companion, each component of a coalescing black hole binary suffers a slow change in its mass (tidal heating) and spin (tidal torquing) during the inspiral and merger. This effect modifies the phase and amplitude of the gravitational waveform. Numerical relativity (NR) waveforms contain these effects inherently, whereas analytical approximants for the early inspiral phase have to include them manually in the energy balance equation. In this work, we construct a frequency-domain gravitational waveform model that incorporates this effect, by recalibrating the inspiral phase of the waveform model IMRPhenomD to incorporate the phase corrections for tidal heating. We also include corrections to the amplitude by adding them directly to the inspiral amplitude model of IMRPhenomD. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the corrections, especially in the phase, confers an overall improvement in the phase agreement between the analytical inspiral model (uncalibrated SEOBNRv2) and NR data. The model presented here is faithful, with less than $1\%$ mismatches against a set of hybrid waveforms (except for one outlier that barely breaches this limit). The recalibrated model shows mismatches of up to $\sim 14\%$ with IMRPhenomD for high mass ratios and spins. Amplitude corrections become less significant for higher mass ratios, whereas the phase corrections leave more impact -- suggesting that the former is practically irrelevant for gravitational wave data analysis in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), Virgo and KAGRA. Comparing with a set of 219 numerical relativity waveforms, we find that the median of mismatches decreases by $\sim 4\%$ in aLIGO zero-detuned high power noise curve, and by $\sim 1.5\%$ with a flat noise curve. This implies a modest but notable improvement in waveform accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We study the degrees of freedom of the Proca theory, non-minimally coupled to gravity. In the Minkowski background, this theory propagates five degrees of freedom -- a massive longitudinal mode, two massive vector ones, and two massless tensor modes. At first sight, the non-linear coupling between the metric perturbations and the vector field indicates that both longitudinal and tensor modes become strongly coupled, at the same scale. This would imply that no matter how small the photon mass is if non-minimal coupling is taken into account, gravitational waves would necessarily be strongly coupled. We show that the way out of this inconsistency is through the introduction of the disformal coupling to the metric perturbations that resemble the vector-type disformal transformations. This way, the unphysical coupling between the two types of modes can be avoided, rendering the model consistent. As a result, we show that only the longitudinal modes enter a strong coupling regime, while both tensor and transverse modes remain weakly coupled at all scales up to the Planck length. Finally, using the same form of the disformal transformation, we introduce a disformal frame in which the recently reported runaway modes are absent.</description>

Abstract: We study the internal dynamics of a hypothetical spaceship traveling on a close timelike curve in an axially symmetric universe. We choose the curve so that the generator of evolution in proper time is the angular momentum. Using Wigner's theorem, we prove that the energy levels internal to the spaceship must undergo spontaneous discretization. The level separation turns out to be finely tuned so that, after completing a roundtrip of the curve, all systems are back to their initial state. This implies, for example, that the memories of an observer inside the spaceship are necessarily erased by the end of the journey. More in general, if there is an increase in entropy, a Poincar\'{e} cycle will eventually reverse it by the end of the loop, forcing entropy to decrease back to its initial value. We show that such decrease in entropy is in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The non-existence of time-travel paradoxes follows as a rigorous corollary of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the gravitational scattering in the absence of peeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetries of the gravitational scattering are intimately tied to the symmetries which preserve asymptotic flatness at null infinity. In Penrose's definition of asymptotic flatness, a central role is played by the notion of asymptotic simplicity and the ensuing peeling behavior which dictates the decay rate of the Weyl tensor. However, there is now accumulating evidence that in a generic gravitational scattering the peeling property is broken, so that the spacetime is not asymptotically-flat in the usual sense. These obstructions to peeling can be traced back to the existence of universal radiative low frequency observables called "tails to the displacement memory". The universality of these tail modes is the statement of the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Sahoo, Saha and Sen. Four-dimensional gravitation scattering therefore exhibits a rich infrared interplay between tail to the memory, loss of peeling, and universal logarithmic soft theorems. In this paper we study the solution space and the asymptotic symmetries for logarithmically-asymptotically-flat spacetimes. These are defined by a polyhomogeneous expansion of the Bondi metric which gives rise to a loss of peeling, and represent the classical arena which can accommodate a generic gravitational scattering containing tails to the memory. We show that while the codimension-two generalized BMS charges are sensitive to the loss of peeling at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the flux is insensitive to the fate of peeling. Due to the tail to the memory, the soft superrotation flux contains a logarithmic divergence whose coefficient is the quantity which is conserved in the scattering by virtue of the logarithmic soft theorem. In our analysis we also exhibit new logarithmic evolution equations and flux-balance laws, whose presence suggests the existence of an infinite tower of subleading logarithmic soft graviton theorems.</description>

Abstract: Hawking's seminal work on black hole radiation highlights a critical issue in our understanding of quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), specifically the problem of unitarity loss (where pure states evolve into mixed states). In this paper, we examine a recent proposal for a direct-sum QFTCS, which maintains unitarity through a novel quantization method that employs geometric superselection rules based on discrete spacetime transformations. This approach describes a quantum state in terms of components that evolve within geometric superselection sectors of the complete Hilbert space, adhering to the discrete symmetries of a Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, it represents a maximally entangled pure state as a direct-sum of two components in the interior and exterior regions of the black hole, thereby preserving the unitarity of Hawking radiation by keeping it in the form of pure states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a generalized parameter space, regular black holes can be regarded as non-singular solutions under specific parameters in Einstein gravity theory coupled with non-linear electromagnetic fields. Following this concept, we investigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime without event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each exhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS black holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole states and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A phase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found. Significantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit discontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence of a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class black hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system, highlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Ringdown of a postinnermost stable circular orbit of a rapidly spinning black hole: Mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasinormal mode excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a binary merger with a small mass ratio, as the secondary body approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the primary black hole, the motion transitions from the adiabatic inspiral to the plunge governed by the geodesic equation. The plunge orbit is expected to excite the ringdown gravitational wave, which encodes information about the primary black hole's geometry. The details of the transition regime depend on the binary's mass ratio through radiation fluxes, which in turn influence the initial conditions for the plunge. As such, the mass ratio affects the post-ISCO ringdown gravitational wave excitation. In this study, we numerically investigate the mass ratio dependence of higher harmonic quasi-normal mode excitations in the post-ISCO gravitational waves of rapidly spinning black holes, based on the Teukolsky-Sasaki-Nakamura formalism. We consider the effect of mass ratio on the gravitational waves by accounting for the energy and angular momentum losses during the transition regime following the Ori-Thorne procedure. We examine two mass ratio scenarios: the intermediate mass ratio (IMR) and the extreme mass ratio (EMR). Our main finding is that higher harmonic quasi-normal modes are significantly excited in an IMR merger involving a highly spinning primary black hole. This implies that detecting an IMR merger involving such a primary black hole with space-based gravitational wave interferometers can provide valuable opportunities to infer black hole properties or test general relativity with excellent precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov "type-D" spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pure Lovelock Gravity regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new family of regular black holes (RBH) in Pure Lovelock gravity, where the energy density is determined by the gravitational vacuum tension, which varies for each value of $n$ in each Lovelock case. Speculatively, our model may capture quantum effects through gravitational tension. In this way, a hypothetical analogy is drawn between the pair production ratio in the Schwinger effect and our energy density. A notable feature of our model is that the regular solution closely resembles the vacuum solution before reaching the event horizon. For odd $n$, the transverse geometry is spherical, with phase transitions occurring during evaporation, and the final state of this process is a remnant. For even $n$, the transverse geometry is non trivial and corresponds to a hyperboloid. In the case of $d=2n+1$ with even $n$, we find an RBH without a dS core and no inner horizon (whose presence has been recently debated in the literature due to the question of whether its presence is unstable or not), and no phase transitions. For $d &gt; 2n + 1$ with even $n$, the RBH possesses both an event horizon and a cosmological horizon, also with no inner horizon present. The existence of the cosmological horizon arises without the usual requirement of a positive cosmological constant. From both numerical and analytical analysis, we deduce that as the event horizon expands and the cosmological horizon contracts, thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in a remnant when the two horizons coincide.</description>

      <title>Constraining accretion physics with gravitational waves from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We construct and analyse wormhole solutions in quantised space-time. The field equations are constructed from the deformed wormhole metric in the proper reference frame using tetrads. The spatial geometry of the wormhole is analysed in the kappa space-time. Further, the modifications to the conditions that ensure traversibility of the wormhole are studied and it is found that the necessity of the exotic matter persists in the non-commuative case as in the commutative space-time. Casimir energy is considered a possible source for exotic matter and it is shown that the time to pass through the wormhole as well as the amount of exotic matter required to create the wormhole reduce due to non-commutativity of space-time.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are those which may have formed in the early Universe and affected the subsequent evolution of the Universe through their Hawking radiation and gravitational field. To constrain the early Universe from the observational constraint on the abundance of PBHs, it is essential to determine the formation threshold for primordial cosmological fluctuations, which are naturally described by cosmological long-wavelength solutions. I will briefly review our recent analytical and numerical results on the PBH formation.</description>

      <title>A healthier semi-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of quantum systems onto classical ones. Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we numerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of vacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe. Finally, we discuss the application of these results to semi-classical gravity, and the black-hole information problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize how the response of physical systems to spatial rotations constrains the probabilities of events that may be observed. From a foundational point of view, we show that the set of quantum correlations in our scenarios can be derived from rotational symmetry alone, without assuming quantum physics. This shows that important predictions of quantum theory can be derived from the structure of space, demonstrating that semi-device-independent scenarios can be utilized to shed light on the foundations of physics. From a practical perspective, these results allow us to introduce semi-device-independent protocols for the generation of secure random numbers based on the breaking of spatial symmetries. While experimental implementations will rely on quantum physics, the security analysis and the amount of extracted randomness is theory-independent and certified by the observed correlations only. That is, our protocols rely on a physically meaningful assumption: a bound on a theory-independent notion of spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining gravitational subsystems has long been challenging due to the lack of the conventional notion of locality in gravity. In this work, we define gravitational subsystems from the observable spacetime subregions of a set of well-defined accelerating observers. We study the most general horizons of accelerating observers and find that in a general spacetime, only spacelike surfaces satisfying a global condition could become horizons of well-defined accelerating observers, which we name the Rindler-convexity condition. The entanglement entropy associated with a Rindler-convex region is proportional to the area of the enclosing surface. The subregions defined from this observer perspective is named the generalized Rindler wedge. This provides a physical origin for defining gravitational subsystems associated with one type of Type III von Neumann subalgebra. We propose the holographic interpretation of generalized Rindler wedges and provide evidence from the observer correspondence, the subregion subalgebra duality, and the equality of the entanglement entropy, respectively. We introduce time/space cutoffs in the bulk to substantiate this proposition, generalize it, and establish a holographic observer concordance framework, which asserts that the partitioning of degrees of freedom through observation is holographically concordant.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved space-time: the case of Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10345v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct-sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, DQFT leads to the BH evaporation involving only pure states. This means the quantum mechanical effects at the BH horizon produce two components of a maximally entangled pure state in geometric superselection sector Hilbert spaces. This construction enables pure states to evolve into pure states, restoring unitarity and observer complementarity. Finally, we discuss how our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Extracting $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ in Pacif Parametrization Models through Late-Time Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines five models derived from the Pacif parametrization scheme of the Hubble parameter ($H$), yielding various linear to quintic forms of the deceleration parameter (DP). Our goal is to explore the impact of these DP variations on late-time evolution and their potential to alleviate cosmological tensions. To enhance model constraints, we introduce non-diagonal elements into the covariance matrix to better capture statistical properties by simulating data point correlations. We also test the sensitivity of $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$ to the Pacif parametrization scheme, treating the sound horizon $r_{d}$ as a free parameter to avoid imposing a CMB prior. This allows late-time data to constrain $r_{d}$ alongside other cosmological parameters, incorporating recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements and Hubble data from Cosmic Chronometers Methods, Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Quasars over a redshift range of $0.106 &lt; z &lt; 2.33$. Our analysis provides optimal fit values for $H_{0}$ and $r_{d}$, showing notable consistency with Planck CMB data. By using the Akaike information criterion, we analyze the models and conclude that all models have good agreement with the most recent observations.</description>

      <title>On the Hubble expansion in a Big Bang quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble expansion of the Universe is considered in the classical limit of a Big Bang quantum cosmology. In an IR-consistent coupling to the the bare cosmological constant, we infer a dark energy as a relic of the Big Bang by loss of time-translation invariance on a Hubble time-scale. This dark energy is identified with the trace $J$ of the Schouten tensor permitting an analytic solution $H(z)$. Anchored by the {\em Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations}, $J$CDM predicts a Hubble constant $H_0=\sqrt{6/5}\,H_0^\Lambda$ alleviating $H_0$-tension between the Local Distance Ladder and $H_0^\Lambda$ in $\Lambda$CDM, whose dark energy $\Lambda$ is a constant. Emulated by $w(a)\Lambda$CDM, a CAMB analysis shows a $J$CDM fit to the {\em Planck} 2018 $C_l^{TT}$ power spectrum on par with $\Lambda$CDM with small positive curvature consistent with {\em Planck}-$\Lambda$CDM with no extra relativistic degrees of freedom. In late-time cosmology, $J$CDM is also consistent with the BAO recently measured by DESI. { $J$CDM offers a novel framework to address $H_0$-tension, predicting background quantities consistent with the uncertainties in BAO measurements and early-Universe observations.} It predicts a deceleration parameter $q_0\simeq-1$, that may be tested with upcoming low-redshift galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Study of a Tilted Thin Accretion Disk around a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accreting collapsed object GRO J1655-40 could contain the gravitomagnetic monopole (GMM), and it was shown to be better described by the Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime instead of the Kerr spacetime. The warped accretion disk has also been observed for the same collapsed object. Motivated by these, we study a tilted thin inner accretion disk around a KTN black hole. Such a tilting could have a significant effect on the X-ray spectral and timing features via the Lense-Thirring effect. Taking into account the contribution from the inner accretion disk for the KTN black hole, here we calculate the radial profile of a tilt angle. Depending on the numerical values of the viscosity of the accreting material and Kerr parameter, GMM tends the angular momentum of the disk to align along the black hole's spin axis, or to make it more tilted. Our solution for the radial profile of the tilted disk around a KTN black hole could be useful to probe the strong gravity regime, and could also give indirect evidence for the existence of GMM in nature.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat space and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which is controlled in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. This provides analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>
