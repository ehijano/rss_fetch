      <title>Nonreciprocal parametric amplification of elastic waves in supersonic space-time modulated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time modulated elastic media, whose material properties vary in both space and time, have attracted significant attention as a promising strategy for achieving nonreciprocal propagation of elastic waves. To date, most studies have focused on systems with subsonic modulation, where the phase velocity of the modulation wave is lower than that of the guided elastic waves. In contrast, wave propagation under supersonic modulation remains largely unexplored, and the associated nonreciprocal phenomena present an open challenge. In this work, we investigate the dynamic response of elastic longitudinal waves propagating through a spatially bounded medium subjected to supersonic modulation of its elastic properties. We show that supersonic modulation gives rise to directional wavenumber bandgaps in the dispersion diagram, characterized by vanishing wavenumbers. Using a theoretical framework based on mode-coupling theory, we reveal how supersonic modulation governs amplitude modulation and frequency conversion in wave transmission and reflection at spatial interfaces. This leads to nonreciprocal parametric amplification and frequency conversion, phenomena not previously reported in bounded elastic media. Remarkably, the observed parametric amplification is not driven by an imaginary component of the wavenumber, but instead arises from the interference between counter-propagating Floquet-Bloch modes at spatial interfaces. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical predictions and illustrate nonreciprocal amplification and frequency conversion effects. Our findings pave the way for the design of nonreciprocal elastic wave devices with advanced functionalities such as signal processing, energy amplification, and frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian funneling in anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a distinctive phenomenon enabling non-Bloch wave manipulation. However, it has been limited to discrete lattices requiring fine-tuned onsite gain/loss or asymmetric couplings. Here, moving beyond these discrete models, we realize novel NHSE in uniform media by leveraging anisotropy of non-Hermitian density tensors. Experiments based on an acoustic anisotropic metamaterial demonstrate that enabled by the NHSE, wave energy can be directed toward and collected at specific boundaries, exhibiting broadband and wide-angle characteristics. This intriguing phenomenon is termed non-Hermitian wave funneling, which, remarkably, occurs under uniform non-Hermitian modulations, free of fine-tuning. Furthermore, we identify a second-order NHSE, enabling wave funneling toward corners. Our work establishes a paradigm for exploring NHSE in uniform media, advancing the fundamental understanding of non-Hermitian physics and providing novel mechanisms for non-Bloch wave control in metamaterials or even natural materials without delicate tuning.</description>

      <title>Synchronization driven reciprocity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method to break wave transmission reciprocity by leveraging the synchronization of self-oscillators. An experimental demonstration with aeroacoustic cavities is presented. They behave as weakly nonlinear limit cycles when driven by a constant airflow, leading to self-oscillations which can couple to the surrounding waveguides via two ports. Incident waves from one port trigger anti-phase synchronization, causing destructive interference and low transmission, while waves from the opposite port induce in-phase synchronization, resulting in high transmission. This directional dependence effectively breaks reciprocity, where the operational bandwidth is defined by the synchronization region (Arnold tongue), and can be broader than resonance based methods. Experimental results show robust nonreciprocal behavior w.r.t. parameter changes. Moreover, a modified temporal coupled mode theory is proposed, explaining the system's nonlinear dynamics and scattering properties in a quantitative manner. This synchronization-based approach offers a new avenue for directional wave control, complementing traditional reciprocity breaking techniques, and offering an intrinsic loss-compensation emanating from the self-oscillation of meta-atoms.</description>

      <title>Synchronization driven acoustics: The nonlinear scattering of a self-oscillating meta-atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we demonstrate a self-oscillating acoustic meta-atom functioning as an amplifying transistor, where a steady external flow serves as a control signal to switch between reflective (off-state) and transmissive (on-state) regimes. In the on-state, an acoustic limit cycle synchronizes with incident sound waves. This process governs the energy transfer across the device, with a transmission bandwidth dictated by the synchronization region in parameter space (Arnold tongue). Our experimental measurements reveal nonlinear dependence on the incident wave amplitude, enabling perturbation filtering therein and stabilizing downstream acoustic power. All experimentally observed phenomena are quantitatively described by a nonlinear Li\'enard-type oscillator featuring saturable gain and linear loss, where the essential parameters can be estimated by independent measurements. This work may offer a paradigm shift in acoustic metamaterials research by leveraging self-oscillation and synchronization processes. Bridging those key concepts from nonlinear dynamics and complex systems with active metamaterial design in acoustics and related disciplines, may establish a broadly applicable framework of field-independent mechanisms for wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>AI Agents for Photonic Integrated Circuit Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Photonics Intelligent Design and Optimization (PhIDO), a multi-agent framework that converts natural-language photonic integrated circuit (PIC) design requests into layout mask files. We compare 7 reasoning large language models for PhIDO using a testbench of 102 design descriptions that ranged from single devices to 112-component PICs. The success rate for single-device designs was up to 91%. For design queries with less than or equal to 15 components, o1, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest end-to-end pass@5 success rates of approximately 57%, with Gemini-2.5-pro requiring the fewest output tokens and lowest cost. The next steps toward autonomous PIC development include standardized knowledge representations, expanded datasets, extended verification, and robotic automation.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Lattice of Photonic Spin-Meron Tubes in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the first photonic spin-meron tube lattice in free space using spin-angular momentum vectors. Square-block diffraction creates $C_{4}$-symmetric beams with $\pi/2$ phase steps. Non-paraxial spin-orbit coupling then forms finite-length meron tubes ($N_{\mathrm{sk}} \approx \pm 1/2$, $&gt; 25,\lambda$). Extending the formalism, we show that $C_{3}$ geometry of a triangular block yields a spin-skyrmion tube. Stratton-Chu theory and full-vectorial finite-difference time-domain calculations both support this material-agnostic, geometry-driven approach as a platform to explore symmetry-driven free-space topology.</description>

      <title>A framework for finite-strain viscoelasticity based on rheological representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a new constitutive and computational framework based on strain-like internal variables belonging to Sym(3) and two representative rheological configurations. The generalized Maxwell and generalized Kelvin-Voigt models are considered as prototypes for parallelly and serially connected rheological devices, respectively. For each configuration, distinct kinematic assumptions are introduced. The constitutive theory is derived based on thermomechanical principles, where the free energies capture recoverable elastic responses and dissipation potentials govern irreversible mechanisms. The evolution equations for the internal variables arise from the principle of maximum dissipation. A key insight is the structural distinction in the constitutive laws resulted from the two rheological architectures. In particular, the Kelvin-Voigt model leads to evolution equations with non-equilibrium processes coupled, which pose computational challenges for the constitutive integration. To address this, we exploit the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to design an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that strategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula, and the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of non-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and computational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple non-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite strain.</description>

      <title>Topologically Protected Polaritonic Bound State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as powerful tools for realizing ultra-high-Q resonances in nanophotonics. While previous implementations have primarily relied on dielectric metasurfaces, they remain limited by the diffraction limit. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate and experimentally validate the existence of topologically protected phonon-polaritonic BICs in periodic arrays of cylindrical nanoresonators composed of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN), which have the availability of two restrahlen bands (lower (type-I) and upper (type II)), operating in the lower Reststrahlen band (RB-1). Owing to the uniaxial anisotropy of hBN and the rotational symmetry of the structure, these systems support topologically symmetry-protected BICs at the {\Gamma}-point, where radiative losses are fully suppressed. The total quality factor is ultimately bounded by the intrinsic phonon damping of h11BN, enabling high-Q polaritonic modes with minimal radiation leakage. When cylindrical symmetry is broken via angular tilting of incident light away from the normal incidence, these BICs transition into quasi-BICs (q-BICs) with strong field confinement and tunable radiation leakage. This topological protection enables robust control over mode lifetimes and confinement, paving the way toward scalable polaritonic platforms for mid-infrared optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Amorphous metal oxide mixtures for high-Q integrated nonlinear photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choice of material is ubiquitous in integrated photonics to design device properties, whereas changing material composition is much less common. With phase matching as an additional objective, constraints in depositing and patterning thin films limit the use of integrated nonlinear photonics to only select materials. Here, we explore an amorphous metal oxide mixture of titania (TiO2) and tantala (Ta2O5) in which material composition is a tool to enhance and customize photonics properties. In particular, the inclusion of titania reduces the oxygen-defect density in a tantala film, while maintaining a comparable Kerr nonlinear index. With ion-beam sputtering at room temperature, we deposit a thick, ultralow-loss titania-tantala film, and we nanopattern it to create microresonator frequency combs. Titania-tantala microresonators offer lower loss, higher index of refraction, and reduced optical absorption and photorefractive effects. Specifically, the titania-tantala mixture enables microresonator quality factor up to $10^7$ and a direct factor of 1.7 reduction in optical absorption. Our work demonstrates that composition in metal-oxide mixtures is a design parameter alongside the nanofabrication process and photonics design for integrated nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Performances of far and near-field thermophotonic refrigeration devices from the detailed-balance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a near-field thermophotonic (NF-TPX) refrigerating device, consisting of a lightemitting diode and a photovoltaic cell in close proximity. Calculations are performed in the frame of the detailed-balance approach. We study how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect both cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess the impact of bandgap energy and internal quantum efficiency for an artificial material on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs and/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10% reduction of the quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on electroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance prediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling devices.</description>
