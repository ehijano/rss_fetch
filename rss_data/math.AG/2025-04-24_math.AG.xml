      <title>A rank-$2$ vector bundle on ${\mathbb P}^2\times {\mathbb P}^2$ and projective geometry of nonclassical Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a rank-$2$ indecomposable vector bundle on $\mathbb P^2\times\mathbb P^2$ in characteristic $2$ that
  does not come from a bundle on $\mathbb P^2$ by factor projection nor from a bundle on $\mathbb P^{m} $
  by central projection. We show that the zero-sets of a suitable twist of $E$ form
  a family of nonclassical smooth Enriques surfaces of bidegree (4, 4) whose general member is
  'singular' in the sense that Frobenius acts isomorphically on $H^1$, and there is a smooth divisor consisting of smooth supersingular surfaces (Frobenius acts as zero). Every nonclassical Enriques surface of bidegree (4, 4) in $\mathbb P^2\times\mathbb P^2$ that is bilinearly normal arises as a zero-set in this way.</description>

      <title>The (noncommutative) geometry of difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this monograph is twofold: to explain various nonautonomous integrable systems (discrete Painlev\'e all the way up to the elliptic level, as well as generalizations \`a la Garnier) using an interpretation of difference and differential equations as sheaves on noncommutative projective surfaces, and to develop the theory of such surfaces enough to allow one to apply the usual GIT construction of moduli spaces of sheaves. This requires a fairly extensive development of the theory of birationally ruled noncommutative projective surfaces, both showing that the analogues of Cremona transformations work and understanding effective, nef, and ample divisor classes. This combines arXiv:1307.4032, arXiv:1307.4033, arXiv:1907.11301, as well as those portions of arXiv:1607.08876 needed to make things self-contained. Some additional results appear, most notably a proof that the resulting discrete actions on moduli spaces of equations are algebraically integrable.</description>

      <title>The Universe of Deligne-Mostow Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deligne and Mostow investigated period maps on the configuration spaces $M_{0,n}$ of $n$ ordered points on $\mathbb{P}^1$. The images of these maps are open subsets of certain ball quotients. Moreover, they extend to isomorphisms between GIT-quotients and the Baily-Borel compactifications. Building on a theorem of Gallardo, Kerr and Schaffler, the period maps lift to isomorphisms between two natural compactifications, namely the Kirwan blow-up and the toroidal compactification. In this paper, we look at the more general situation where we also allow unordered or partially ordered $n$-tuples. Our main result is an easily verifiable criterion that, in this broader setting, determines when the Deligne-Mostow period maps still lift to isomorphisms between the Kirwan blow-up and the toroidal compactification. We further investigate a partial ordering among Deligne-Mostow varieties, which reduces this problem to considering minimal or maximal Deligne-Mostow varieties with respect to this partial ordering. As a byproduct, we prove that, in general, Kirwan's resolution pair is not a log canonical log minimal model and not log $K$-equivalent to the unique toroidal compactification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the moduli space of rank-2 free algebras, along with several of its natural subspaces, as presheaf quotients: specifically, as the quotient of the functor of points of a scheme by the functor of points of a group scheme acting on it.</description>

      <title>Tracking the symmetries of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s within the Mathieu groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3, we provide a counterpart to the extensive studies by Nikulin and others of the geometry and symmetries of classical Kummer surfaces. In particular, we determine the group of holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3. We moreover track this group within two of the Mathieu groups, which involves a variation of Kondo's lattice techniques that Taormina and Wendland introduced earlier in their study of the symmetries of Kummer surfaces and the genesis of their symmetry surfing programme. Specifically, we realise the finite group of symplectic automorphisms of this class of K3 surfaces as a subgroup of the sporadic groups Mathieu 12 and Mathieu 24 in terms of permutations of 12, resp. 24 elements. As a proof of concept, we construct an embedding that yields the largest Mathieu group when the symmetry group of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s is combined with all symmetries of Kummer surfaces.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Cycles for Zariski-Constructible Sheaves on Rigid Analytic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of nearby and vanishing cycles in the context of finite-coefficient Zariski-constructible sheaves over a non-archimedean field which is non-trivially valued, complete, algebraically closed, and of mixed characteristic or equal characteristic zero. Apart from basic properties, we show that they preserve Zariski-constructibility, have a Milnor fibre interpretation, satisfy Beilinson's gluing construction, are perverse t-exact, and commute with Verdier duality.</description>

      <title>Anabelian properties of tame fundamental groups of singular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anabelian geometry, we consider to what extent the \'{e}tale or tame fundamental groups of schemes reflect geometric properties of the schemes. Although there are many known results (mainly for smooth curves) in this area, general singular curves have rarely been treated. One reason is that we cannot determine the isomorphism classes of singular curves themselves from their \'{e}tale or tame fundamental groups in general. On the other hand, Das proved that the structure of the tame fundamental group of a singular curve over an algebraically closed field is determined by its normalization and an invariant relating to its singularities. In the present paper, by using this and known anabelian results, we determine the isomorphism classes of the normalizations of singular curves over various fields under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Even periodization of spectral stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the operation of even periodization on nonconnective spectral stacks. We show how to recover from it the even filtration of Hahn-Raksit-Wilson, and (a Nygaard-completion of) the filtered prismatization stack of Bhatt-Lurie and Drinfeld. We prove that the moduli stack of oriented elliptic curves of Goerss-Hopkins-Miller and Lurie is the even periodization of the spectrum of topological modular forms. Likewise, the chromatic moduli stack, which we previously studied under the name of the moduli stack of oriented formal groups, arises via even periodization from the sphere spectrum. Over the complex bordism spectrum, we relate even periodization with the symmetric monoidal shearing, in the sense of Devalapurkar, of free gradings.</description>

      <title>The versal deformation of elliptic m-fold point curve singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit, highly symmetric equations for the versal deformation of the singularity $L_{n+1}^n$ consisting of n+1 lines through the origin in n-dimensional affine space in generic position. These make evident that the base space of the versal deformation of $L_{n+1}^n$ is isomorphic to the total space for $L_{n}^{n-1}$, if n&gt;4. By induction it follows that the base space is irreducible and Gorenstein. We discuss the known connection to a modular compactification of the moduli space of (n+1)-pointed curves of genus 1.
  For other elliptic partition curves it seems unfeasable to compute the versal deformation in general. It is doubtful whether the base space is Gorenstein. For rational partition curves we show that the base space in general has components of different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Volumes of divisors in a family and variation of singularities of linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of volumes of divisors in a family. We show that the volume of a divisor on the generic fiber equals the infimum of its volumes on fibers over any dense subset of the base. As an application, we show that the volume function is upper semicontinuous in flat families with reduced and irreducible fibers.
  We also prove that for a $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier divisor $B$ on a family of varieties $X\rightarrow T$, if $(X_t,|B_t|_{\mathbb{Q}})$ is $\epsilon$-lc and the volume of $B_t$ is a constant for densely many closed points $t\in T$, then the generic fiber $(X_\eta,|B_\eta|_{\mathbb{Q}})$ is also $\epsilon$-lc.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of cones of non-reduced plane curves with ordinary singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple proof of the assertion claiming that the spectrum of the cone of a non-reduced plane curve can be determined only by its multiplicities along local irreducible components at each singular point as well as those along global ones together with the degrees of the latter (where the relation between global components and singular points is not needed) if the associated reduced plane curve have only ordinary singularities (for instance a line arrangement). Note that the last condition is strictly weaker than local homogeneity. As a corollary we can also get a simple proof of a formula which is equivalent to the one obtained earlier by the second-named author.</description>

Abstract: We establish numerical criteria for when a Noether-Lefschetz divisor on a moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces $F_{2d}$, or more generally on an orthogonal modular variety, generates an extremal ray in the cone of pseudoeffective divisors. In particular, for all d, we exhibit many extremal rays of the cone of pseudoeffective divisors of both $F_{2d}$ and any normal projective $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial compactification of $F_{2d}$ lying over its Baily-Borel compactification.</description>

      <title>Projective Variety Recovery from Unknown Linear Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a smooth irreducible algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $n$ embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ (with $m \geq n+2$), which degree is $d$, can be recovered using two projections from unknown points onto unknown hyperplanes. The centers and the hyperplanes of projection are unknown: the only input is the defining equations of each projected varieties. We show how both the projection operators and the variety in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ can be recovered modulo some action of the group of projective transformations of $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$. This configuration generalizes results obtained in the context of curves embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^3$ and results concerning surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^4$.
  We show how in a generic situation, a characteristic matrix of the pair of projections can be recovered. In the process we address dimensional issues and as a result establish a necessary condition, as well as a sufficient condition to compute this characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity. These conditions are expressed as minimal values of the degree of the dual variety.
  Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of projections and as a consequence to recover the variety. For a generic situation, two projections define a variety with two irreducible components. One component has degree $d(d-1)$ and the other has degree $d$, being the original variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Bogomolov type inequalities for high Chern characters of semistable sheaves satisfying certain Frobenius semipositivity. The key ingredients in the proof are a high rank generalization of the asymptotic Riemann-Roch theorem and Langer's estimation theorem of the global sections of torsion free sheaves. These results give some Bogomolov type inequalities for semistable sheaves with vanishing low Chern characters. Our results are also applied to obtain inequalities of Chern characters of threefolds and varieties of small codimension in projective spaces and abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>An integral analogue of Fontaine's crystalline functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a smooth formal scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ over the Witt vectors $W$ of a perfect field $k$, we construct a functor $\mathbb{D}_\mathrm{crys}$ from the category of prismatic $F$-crystals $(\mathcal{E},\varphi_\mathcal{E})$ (or prismatic $F$-gauges) on $\mathfrak{X}$ to the category of filtered $F$-crystals on $\mathfrak{X}$. We show that $\mathbb{D}_\mathrm{crys}(\mathcal{E},\varphi_\mathcal{E})$ enjoys strong properties (e.g., strong divisibility in the sense of Faltings) when $(\mathcal{E},\varphi_\mathcal{E})$ is what we call locally filtered free (lff). Most significantly, we show that $\mathbb{D}_\mathrm{crys}$ actually induces an equivalence between the category of prismatic $F$-gauges on $\mathfrak{X}$ with Hodge--Tate weights in $[0,p-2]$ and the category of Fontaine--Laffaille modules on $\mathfrak{X}$. Finally, we use our functor $\mathbb{D}_\mathrm{crys}$ to enhance the study of prismatic Dieduonn\'e theory of $p$-divisible groups (as initiated by Ansch\"{u}tz--Le Bras) allowing one to recover the filtered crystalline Dieudonn\'e crystal from the prismatic Dieudonn\'e crystal. This in turn allows us to clarify the relationship between prismatic Dieudonn\'e theory and the work of Kim on classifying $p$-divisible groups using Breuil--Kisin modules.</description>

Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1,m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas with $k\ge3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for studying reduction types of arithmetic curves and wildly ramified base change. We give new proofs of earlier results of Lorenzini and Obus-Wewers, and resolve a question of Lorenzini on the Euler characteristic of the resolution graph of a $p$-cyclic arithmetic surface quotient singularity. Our method consists of constructing a simultaneous skeleton for the associated cover of Berkovich analytifications and applying a skeletal Riemann-Hurwitz formula.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Minimal Matroid Extensions and Irreducible Decompositions of Circuit Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method for decomposing the circuit variety of a given matroid $M$, based on an algorithm that identifies its minimal extensions. These extensions correspond to the smallest elements above $M$ in the poset defined by the dependency order. We apply our algorithm to several classical configurations: the V\'amos matroid, the unique Steiner quadruple system $S(3,4,8)$, the projective and affine planes, the dual of the Fano matroid, and the dual of the graphic matroid of $K_{3,3}$. In each case, we compute the minimal irreducible decomposition of their circuit varieties.</description>

      <title>p-adic Cherednik algebras on rigid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth rigid space with an action of a finite group $G$ satisfying that $X/G$ is represented by a rigid space. We construct sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras on the small \'etale site of the quotient $X/G$, and study some of their properties. The sheaves of $p$-adic Cherednik algebras are sheaves of Fr\'echet $K$-algebras on $X/G$, which can be regarded as $p$-adic analytic versions of the sheaves of Cherednik algebras associated to the action of a finite group on a smooth algebraic variety defined by P. Etingof. Furthermore, their sections on small enough $G$-invariant affinoid spaces are canonically Fr\'echet-Stein algebras. Along the way, we construct sheaves of infinite order twisted differential operators on $X$, we give a $G$-equivariant classification of the Atiyah algebras (Picard algebroids) on $X$, and study the category of co-admissible modules over a sheaf of infinite order twisted differential operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and let $\mathbb{P}^1$ be the projective line over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Firstly, we give an explicit formula for the number of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-rational points of generalized Steinberg varieties of $G$. Secondly, for each principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1$, we give an explicit formula counting the number of triples consisting of parabolic structures at $0$ and $\infty$ and a compatible nilpotent section of the associated adjoint bundle. In the case of $GL_{n}$ we calculate a generating function of such volumes re-deriving a result of Mellit.</description>

      <title>Period integrals of hypersurfaces via tropical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\left\{ Z_t \right\}_t$ be a one-parameter family of complex hypersurfaces of dimension $d \geq 1$ in a toric variety. We compute asymptotics of period integrals for $\left\{ Z_t \right\}_t$ by applying the method of Abouzaid--Ganatra--Iritani--Sheridan, which uses tropical geometry. As integrands, we consider Poincar\'{e} residues of meromorphic $(d+1)$-forms on the ambient toric variety, which have poles along the hypersurface $Z_t$. The cycles over which we integrate them are spheres and tori which correspond to tropical $(0, d)$-cycles and $(d, 0)$-cycles on the tropicalization of $\left\{ Z_t \right\}_t$ respectively. In the case of $d=1$, we explicitly write down the polarized logarithmic Hodge structure of Kato--Usui at the limit as a corollary. Throughout this article, we impose the assumption that the tropicalization is dual to a unimodular triangulation of the Newton polytope.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of unlikely intersections for automorphisms of Markov surfaces of positive entropy. We show for certain parameters that two automorphisms with positive entropy share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they share a common iterate. Our proof uses arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties, the theory of laminar currents and quasi-Fuchsian representation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Campana introduced a notion of Campana rational connectedness for Campana orbifolds. Given a Campana fibration over a complex curve, we prove that a version of weak approximation for Campana sections holds at places of good reduction when the general fiber satisfies a slightly stronger version of Campana rational connectedness. Campana also conjectured that any Fano orbifold is Campana rationally connected; we verify a stronger statement for toric Campana orbifolds. A key tool in our study is log geometry and moduli stacks of stable log maps.</description>

Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. When the base field is not a number field or the function field of a curve we use the theory of Moriwaki heights to prove the result.</description>

      <title>Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly compute two kinds of algebraic Belyi functions on Bring's curve. One is related to a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the other is relate to a congruence subgroup of the triangle group $\Delta(2,4,5)\subset {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. To carry out the computation, we use elliptic cusp forms of weight 2 for the former case while the automorphism group of Bring's curve for the latter case. We also discuss a suitable base field (a number field) for isomorphisms between Hulek-Craig's curve, Bring's curve, and its another algebraic model obtained as a modular curve.</description>
