      <title>Rapid Mid-Infrared Spectral-Timing with JWST. I. The prototypical black hole X-ray Binary GRS 1915+105 during a MIR-bright and X-ray-obscured state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared (MIR) spectral-timing measurements of the prototypical Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105. The source was observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST in June 2023 at a MIR luminosity L(MIR)~10^{36} erg/s exceeding past IR levels by about a factor of 10. By contrast, the X-ray flux is much fainter than the historical average, in the source's now-persistent 'obscured' state. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum shows a plethora of emission lines, the strongest of which are consistent with recombination in the hydrogen Pfund (Pf) series and higher. Low amplitude (~1%) but highly significant peak-to-peak photometric variability is found on timescales of ~1,000 s. The brightest Pf(6-5) emission line lags the continuum. Though difficult to constrain accurately, this lag is commensurate with light-travel timescales across the outer accretion disc or with expected recombination timescales inferred from emission line diagnostics. Using the emission line as a bolometric indicator suggests a moderate (~5-30% Eddington) intrinsic accretion rate. Multiwavelength monitoring shows that JWST caught the source close in-time to unprecedentedly bright MIR and radio long-term flaring. Assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the MIRI continuum suggests an unsustainably high mass-loss rate during this time unless the wind remains bound, though other possible origins cannot be ruled out. PAH features previously detected with Spitzer are now less clear in the MIRI data, arguing for possible destruction of dust in the interim. These results provide a preview of new parameter space for exploring MIR spectral-timing in XRBs and other variable cosmic sources on rapid timescales.</description>

      <title>Enhanced particle acceleration in a pulsar wind interacting with a companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar winds have been shown to be preferred sites of particle acceleration and high-energy radiation. Numerous studies have been conducted to better characterize the general structure of such relativistic plasmas in isolated systems. However, many pulsars are found in binary systems and there are currently no ab initio models available that would include both the pulsar magnetosphere and the wind of the pulsar in interaction with a spherical companion. We investigate the interaction between a pulsar wind and a companion to probe the rearrangement of the pulsar wind, assess whether it leads to an enhancement of particle acceleration, and predict the high-energy radiative signature that stems from this interaction. We perform two-dimensional equatorial particle-in-cell simulations of an inclined pulsar surrounded by a spherical, unmagnetized, perfectly conducting companion settled in its wind. We find that the presence of the companion significantly alters the structure of the wind. When the companion lies beyond the fast magnetosonic point, a shock is established and the perturbations are advected in a cone behind the companion. We observe an enhancement of particle acceleration due to forced reconnection as the current sheet reaches the companion surface. Hence, high-energy synchrotron radiation is also amplified. The orbital light curves display two broad peaks reaching up to 14 times the high-energy pulsed flux emitted by an isolated pulsar magnetosphere. These effects increase with the growth of the companion size and with the decrease of the pulsar-companion separation. The present study suggests that a pulsar wind interacting with a companion induces a significant enhancement of high-energy radiation that takes the form of an orbital-modulated hollow cone of emission, which should be detectable by galactic-plane surveys, possibly with long-period radio transient counterparts.</description>

      <title>Active Galaxy Science with the Line Emission Mapper: The Case for High-Resolution Soft X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This white paper discusses the breadth of science related to active galactic nuclei (AGN) and associated phenomena to be enabled by a mission with microcalorimeter energy resolution in the soft X-ray band, a large collecting area, and wide-field imaging. Such a mission, the Line Emission Mapper (LEM), has been proposed to NASA's 2023 Astrophysics Probe Explorer call. While the science pillars of the PI-led part of the mission focus on galaxy evolution, the PI-led LEM All-Sky Survey (LASS) and General Observer/Investigator opportunities will enable vital discoveries for AGN science in the critical soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>Rapid Response Mode observations of GRB 160203A: Looking for fine-structure line variability at z=3.52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic known explosions. Despite fading rapidly, they allow to measure redshift and important properties of their host-galaxies. We report the photometric and spectroscopic study of GRB 160203A and its host-galaxy. Fine-structure absorption lines, detected in the afterglow at different epochs, allow us to investigate variability due to the strong fading background source. We obtained two optical to near-infrared spectra of the afterglow with X-shooter on ESO/VLT, 18 min and 5.7 hrs after the burst, allowing us to investigate temporal changes of fine-structure absorption lines. We measured HI column density log N(HI/cm-2)=21.75+/-0.10, and several heavy-element ions along the GRB sight-line in the host-galaxy: SiII,AlII,AlIII,CII,NiII,SiIV,CIV,ZnII,FeII, and FeII and SiII fine structure transitions from energetic levels excited by the afterglow, at a redshift z=3.518. We measured [M/H]TOT=-0.78+/-0.13 and [Zn/Fe]FIT=0.69+/-0.15, representing the total(dust-corrected) metallicity and dust depletion, respectively. We detected additional intervening systems along the line of sight at z=1.03,z=1.26,z=1.98,z=1.99,z=2.20 and z=2.83. We could not measure significant variability in the fine-structure lines throughout all the observations and determined an upper limit for the GRB distance from the absorber of d&lt;300 pc, adopting the canonical UV pumping scenario. However, we note that the quality of our data is not sufficient to conclusively rule out collisions as an alternative mechanism. GRB 160203A belongs to a growing sample of GRBs with medium resolution spectroscopy, provided by the Swift/X-shooter legacy program, which enables detailed investigation of the interstellar medium in high-redshift GRB host-galaxies. In particular, this host galaxy shows relatively high metal enrichment and dust depletion already in place when the universe was only 1.8 Gyr old.</description>

      <title>Upshifted frequency of electromagnetic plasma waves due to reflecting gravitational waves acting as almost-luminal mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dispersive gravitational waves, as a background spacetime, can reflect electromagnetic waves in a plasma. This reflection upshifts the frequency of the reflected wave, being larger for low-frequency incident waves. This effect takes place when the gravitational wave background propagates almost at the speed of light, allowing it to behave similar to a luminal mirror to electromagnetic plasma waves.</description>

      <title>Extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the star forming region of the W3 complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the W3 complex using about 14 years of Pass 8 data recorded by the $\it Fermi$ Large Area Telescope (\textit{Fermi}-LAT). We resolve the $\gamma$-ray emissions around W3 into two components: an elliptical Gaussian overlapping with the molecular gas and a point-like source near the cluster W3 Main. The pion-bump feature of SED for the elliptical Gaussian together with the better fitting result of pion decay model favor the hadronic origin. We further argue that the cosmic rays (CRs) could originate from the interactions between cluster winds and the shock produced by the SNR HB3. The point-like source positionally coincident with the star cluster W3 Main indicates it may be directly powered by near clusters, while its fainter $\gamma$-ray emissions below 10 GeV is possibly due to the shelter from dense gas making the low-energy CRs incapable of penetrating the dense materials. Meanwhile, we cannot rule out that the $\gamma$-ray emissions originate from the interaction of accelerated protons in SNR with the ambient gas.</description>

      <title>A Star Cluster Population of High Mass Black Hole Mergers in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars. This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters. This population becomes dominant above $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$, which we interpret as the lower edge of the pair-instability mass gap. Upcoming data will enable us to tightly constrain the hierarchical formation hypothesis and refine our understanding of binary black hole formation.</description>

      <title>The case for Centaurus A as the main source of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility that a dominant fraction of the cosmic rays above the ankle is due to a single nearby source, considering in particular the radio galaxy Centaurus A. We focus on the properties of the source spectrum and composition required to reproduce the observations, showing that the nuclei are strongly suppressed for E&gt;10Z EeV, either by a rigidity dependent source cutoff or by the photodisintegration interactions with the CMB at the giant dipole resonance. The very mild attenuation effects at lower energies imply that the secondary nuclei from this source only provide a small contribution. Given the moderate anisotropies observed, the deflections in extragalactic and Galactic magnetic fields should play a crucial role in determining the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution. The diffusion in extragalactic fields as well as the finite source lifetime also significantly affect the shape of the observed spectrum. The cosmic ray flux at tens of EeV is dominated by the CNO component, and we show that it is actually better reproduced by a mixture of C and O nuclei rather than by the usual assumption of a N component effectively describing this mass group. The Si and Fe group components become dominant above 70 EeV, in the energy range in which a strong spectral suppression is present. If the localised flux excess appearing above 40 EeV around the Centaurus A direction is attributed to the CNO component, the He nuclei from the source in the energy range from 10 to 20 EeV could lead to a similar anisotropy unless its contribution is suppressed. The cosmic ray flux at a few EeV should mostly result from a more isotropic light component associated to a population of extragalactic sources. The inclusion of the subdominant contribution of heavy nuclei from the Galactic component helps to reproduce the observations around 1 EeV.</description>

      <title>X-ray and gamma-ray study for 2023 nova eruption of V1716 Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of X-ray and gamma-ray analyses of the nova V1716 Sco taken by Swift, NICER, NuSTAR and F ermi-LAT. We have detected gamma-ray emission at a significant level exceeding 8 {\sigma} in daily bins starting the day after the optical eruption. The gamma-ray emission, characterized by a Test Statistic (TS) value more than four, persisted for approximately 40 days. Notably, harder X-ray emission were observed by NuSTAR as the start of gamma-ray emission, which is the fourth classical nova that gamma-ray emission is concurrent with harder X-ray emission from NuSTAR data. V1716 Sco is one of rare samples that clearly shows a hard X-ray emission (1-10 keV bands) in the Swift-XRT data concurrently with gamma-ray emission of Fermi-LAT data, and its light curve in 1.0-10.0 keV bands had a peak at about 20 days after the optical eruption. The X-ray spectrum was initially fitted by a model of thermal plasma emission, and entered a supersoft phase with additional blackbody (BB) component emerged around about 40 days after the optical eruption. NICER data taken in supersoft source phase revealed a quasi-periodic oscillation with a period of 79.10+-1.98 seconds, and the peak phase of the folded light curve varied with time. Moreover, V1716 Sco is the another example that the emission radius in supersoft source phase is significantly larger than the radius of white dwarf, and a simple BB emission model may not be applicable since the luminosity exceeds significantly Eddington limit.</description>

      <title>Mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays from distribution of their arrival directions with the Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a new method to estimate the injected mass composition of ultrahigh cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The method is based on comparison of the energy-dependent distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions as measured by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) with that calculated in a given putative model of UHECR under the assumption that sources trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. As we report in the companion letter, the TA data show large deflections with respect to the LSS which can be explained, assuming small extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF), by an intermediate composition changing to a heavy one (iron) in the highest energy bin. Here we show that these results are robust to uncertainties in UHECR injection spectra, the energy scale of the experiment and galactic magnetic fields (GMF). The assumption of weak EGMF, however, strongly affects this interpretation at all but the highest energies E &gt; 100 EeV, where the remarkable isotropy of the data implies a heavy injected composition even in the case of strong EGMF. This result also holds if UHECR sources are as rare as $2 \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that is the conservative lower limit for the source number density.</description>

      <title>Isotropy of cosmic rays beyond $10^{20}$ eV favors their heavy mass composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extra-galactic magnetic fields the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E ~ 10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E ~ 100 EeV, while the composition at E &gt; 100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extra-galactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.</description>

      <title>The AMS-02 cosmic ray deuteron flux is consistent with a secondary origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent measurements of cosmic ray deuteron fluxes by AMS-02 show that the rigidity dependence of deuterons is similar with that of protons but flatter than $^3$He, which has been attributed to the existence of primary deuterons with abundance much higher than that from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The requirement of highly deuteron-abundant sources imposes a serious challenge on the modern astrophysics since there is no known process to produce a large amount of deuterons without violating other constraints \cite{1976Natur.263..198E}. In this work we demonstrate that the fragmentation of heavy nuclei up to iron plays a crucial role in shaping/enhancing the spectrum/flux of the cosmic ray deuterons. Based on the latest cosmic ray data, the predicted secondary fluxes of deuterons and $^3$He are found to be reasonably consistent with the AMS-02 measurements and a primary deuteron component is not needed. The apparent difference between D/$^4$He (D/p) and $^3$He/$^4$He ($^3$He/p) is probably due to a combined effect of the kinetic-energy-to-rigidity conversion and the solar modulation. More precise measurements of the fragmentation cross sections of various nuclei to produce deuterons, tritons, and $^3$He in a wide energy range will be very helpful in further testing the secondary origin of cosmic ray deuterons.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Method for Monte Carlo Calculations of Radiative Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative processes such as synchrotron radiation and Compton scattering play an important role in astrophysics. Radiative processes are fundamentally stochastic in nature, and the best tools currently used for resolving these processes computationally are Monte Carlo (MC) methods. These methods typically draw a large number of samples from a complex distribution such as the differential cross section for electron-photon scattering, and then use these samples to compute the radiation properties such as angular distribution, spectrum, and polarization. In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) technique for efficient sampling from arbitrary known probability distributions that can be used to accelerate Monte Carlo calculation of radiative processes in astrophysical scenarios. In particular, we apply our technique to inverse Compton radiation and find that our ML method can be up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional methods currently in use.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos and Relic Neutrino Matter Effect on the High-energy Neutrino Flavor Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if neutrinos are pseudo-Dirac, they can potentially affect the flavor ratio predictions for the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube. In this context, we point out a novel matter effect induced by the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) on the flavor ratio composition. Specifically, the active-sterile neutrino oscillations over the astrophysical baseline lead to an energy-dependent flavor ratio at Earth due to the C$\nu$B matter effect, which is distinguishable from the vacuum oscillation effect, provided there is a local C$\nu$B overdensity. Considering the projected precision of the 3-neutrino oscillation parameter measurements and improved flavor triangle measurements, we show that the next-generation neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, can probe the pseudo-Dirac neutrino hypothesis in a distinctive way.</description>

      <title>Resonant Conversion of Gravitational Waves in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves are the subject of rapidly growing interest in the theoretical and experimental community. In this work we calculate the resonant conversion of gravitational waves into photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars via the inverse Gertsenshtein mechanism. The resonance occurs in regions where the vacuum birefringence effects cancel the classical plasma contribution to the photon dispersion relation, leading to a massless photon in the medium which becomes kinematically matched to the graviton. We set limits on the amplitude of a possible stochastic background of gravitational waves using X-ray and IR flux measurements of neutron stars. Using Chandra ($2-8\,\text{keV}$) and NuSTAR ($3-79\,\text{keV}$) observations of RX J1856.6-3754, we set strain limits $h_c^{\rm lim} \simeq 10^{-26} - 10^{-24}$ in the frequency range $ 5\times 10^{17}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{19}\,\text{Hz}$. Our limits are many orders of magnitude stronger than existing constrains from individual neutron stars at the same frequencies. We also use recent JWST observations of the Magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the range $2.7\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 5.9\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} $, setting a limit $h_{\rm c}^{\rm lim} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-19}$. These constraints are in complementary frequency ranges to laboratory searches with CAST, OSQAR and ALPS II. We expect these limits to be improved both in reach and breadth with a more exhaustive use of telescope data across the full spectrum of frequencies and targets.</description>

      <title>Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars: Bremsstrahlung and modified urca rates reexamined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino emission in cold neutron stars is dominated by the modified urca (murca) process and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. The standard emission rates were provided by Friman and Maxwell in 1979, effectively based on a chiral Lagrangian framework with pion and rho meson exchange, supplemented by Landau parameters to describe short-range interactions. We reevaluate these rates within the same framework, correcting several errors and removing unnecessary simplifications, notably the triangular approximation -- Fermi momenta of protons and leptons negligible compared to the neutrons one -- in MURCA, and quantify their importance. The impact of rho meson exchange, previously argued to cancel with interference effects, is actually quite relevant. Altogether, the cooling rates are reduced by as much as a factor 2. We provide comprehensive analytical formulas encompassing all contributions, designed for straightforward numerical implementation. Our results are particularly relevant for astrophysical studies of neutron stars evolution and for studies of physics beyond the standard model, where the emission of new particles -- such as axions -- is typically computed within the same framework we adopt here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple extension to the Standard Model, wherein neutrinos naturally attain small Majorana masses through a one-loop radiative mechanism featuring particles within the loops characterized by milli-charges. Unlike the conventional scotogenic model, our approach avoids imposing a discrete symmetry or expanding the gauge sector. The minuscule electric charges ensure the stability of the lightest particle within the loop as a viable dark matter candidate. Our investigation systematically scrutinizes the far-reaching phenomenological implications arising from these minuscule charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray antimatter, particularly low-energy antideuterons, serves as a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilating in our Galaxy. We study this smoking-gun signature and explore its complementarity with indirect dark matter searches using cosmic-ray antiprotons. To this end, we develop the neural network emulator $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet, enabling a fast prediction of propagated antideuteron energy spectra for a wide range of annihilation channels and their combinations. We revisit the Monte Carlo simulation of antideuteron coalescence and cosmic-ray propagation, allowing us to explore the uncertainties of both processes. In particular, we take into account uncertainties from the $\Lambda_b$ production rate and consider two distinctly different propagation models. Requiring consistency with cosmic-ray antiproton limits, we find that AMS-02 shows sensitivity to a few windows of dark matter masses only, most prominently below 20 GeV. This region can be probed independently by the upcoming GAPS experiment. The program package $\overline{\text{D}}$arkRayNet is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Curved detectors for future X-ray astrophysics missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future X-ray astrophysics missions will survey large areas of the sky with unparalleled sensitivity, enabled by lightweight, high-resolution optics. These optics inherently produce curved focal surfaces with radii as small as 2 m, requiring a large area detector system that closely conforms to the curved focal surface. We have embarked on a project using a curved charge-coupled device (CCD) detector technology developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to provide large-format, curved detectors for such missions, improving performance and simplifying design. We present the current status of this work, which aims to curve back-illuminated, large-format (5 cm x 4 cm) CCDs to 2.5-m radius and confirm X-ray performance. We detail the design of fixtures and the curving process, and present intial results on curving bare silicon samples and monitor devices and characterizing the surface geometric accuracy. The tests meet our accuracy requirement of &lt;5 $\mu$m RMS surface non-conformance for samples of similar thickness to the functional detectors. We finally show X-ray performance measurements of planar CCDs that will serve as a baseline to evaluate the curved detectors. The detectors exhibit low noise, good charge-transfer efficiency, and excellent, uniform spectroscopic performance, including in the important soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>The prototypical major cluster merger Abell 754. I. Calibration of MeerKAT data and radio/X-ray spectral mapping of the cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abell 754 is a rich galaxy cluster at $z=0.0543$ and is considered the prototype of a major cluster merger. Like many dynamically unrelaxed systems, it hosts diffuse radio emission on Mpc-scales. Extended synchrotron sources in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are commonly interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the gravitational energy released during cluster mergers is dissipated into non-thermal components. Here, we use new MeerKAT UHF- and L-band observations to study non-thermal phenomena in Abell 754. These data are complemented with archival XMM-Newton observations to investigate the resolved spectral properties of both the radio and X-ray cluster emission. For the first time, we employed the pipeline originally developed to calibrate LOFAR data to MeerKAT observations. This allowed us to perform a direction-dependent calibration and obtain highly sensitive radio images in UHF- and L-bands which capture the extended emission with unprecedented detail. By using a large XMM-Newton mosaic, we produced thermodynamic maps of the ICM. Our analysis reveals that the radio halo in the cluster center is bounded by the well-known shock in the eastern direction. Furthermore, in the south-west periphery, we discover an extended radio source that we classify as a radio relic which is possibly tracing a shock driven by the squeezed gas compressed by the merger, outflowing in perpendicular directions. The low-luminosity of this relic appears compatible with direct acceleration of thermal pool electrons. We interpreted the observed radio and X-ray features in the context of a major cluster merger with a non-zero impact parameter. Abell 754 is a remarkable galaxy cluster showcasing exceptional features associated with the ongoing merger event. The high quality of the new MeerKAT data motivates further work on this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our findings from the new deep Chandra observations ($256$ ks) of the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2031-4037 at $z = 0.34$. Our observations reveal intricate structures seen in a major merger akin to the Bullet Cluster. The X-ray data confirm the existence of two shock fronts, one to the northwest and one to the southeast by directly measuring the temperature jump of gas across the surface brightness edges. The stronger shock front in the northwest has a density jump of $3.16 \pm 0.34$ across the sharp surface brightness edge and Mach number $M = 3.36^{+0.87}_{-0.48}$, which makes this cluster one of the rare merging systems with a Mach number $M &gt; 2$. We use the northwestern shock to compare two models for shock heating - the instant heating model and the Coulomb collisional heating model, and we determine that the temperatures across the shock front agree with the Coulomb collisional model of heating. For the shock front in the southeastern region, we find a density jump of $1.53 \pm 0.14$ and a Mach number of $M = 1.36 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$.</description>

Abstract: Very few detections have been made of optical flashes contemporaneous with prompt high-energy emission from a gamma-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we present and analyze light curves of GRB-associated optical flashes and afterglows from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our sample consists of eight GRBs with arcsecond-level localizations from the X-Ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. For each burst, we characterize the prompt optical emission and any observed afterglow, and constrain physical parameters for four of these bursts using their TESS light curves. This work also presents a straightforward method to correct for TESS's cosmic ray mitigation on 20-second timescales, which allows us to estimate the "true" brightness of optical flashes associated with prompt GRB emission. We also highlight TESS's continuous wide-field monitoring capability, which provides an efficient means of identifying optical emission from GRBs and characterizing early-time afterglow light curves. Based on empirical detection rates from Swift and the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, up to 10 GRBs per year may fall within the contemporaneous TESS field of view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise and efficient identification of the nature of the primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis stands as a fundamental aspiration for any cosmic ray observatory. In particular, the detection and characterization of gamma ray events are challenged by their occurrence within an overwhelmingly greater flux of charged cosmic rays spanning several orders of magnitude. The intricacies of distinguishing between cosmic ray compositions and the inherent uncertainties associated with hadronic interactions present formidable challenges, which, if not properly addressed, can introduce significant sources of systematic errors. This work introduces a novel composition discriminant variable, $P_{tail}^{\alpha}$, which quantifies the number of Water Cherenkov Detectors with a signal well above the mean signal observed in WCDs located at an equivalent distance from the shower core, in events with approximately the same energy at the ground. This new event variable is then shown to be, in the reconstructed energy range $10\,{\rm TeV}$ to $1.6\,{\rm PeV}$, well correlated with the total number of muons that hit, in the same event, all the observatory stations located at a distance greater than $200\,{\rm m}$ from the shower core. The two variables should thus have similar efficiencies in the selection of high-purity gamma event samples and in the determination of the nature of charged cosmic ray events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze more than 15 years of the \gr\ data, obtained with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard {\it the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi)}, for the region of the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW~103, since the nearby source 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e, counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 and $\simeq$13\,arcmin away from the SNR, is determined to be extended in the more recent Fermi-LAT source catalog. Different templates for 4FGL J1616.2$-$5054e and RCW~103 are tested, and we find that a point source with a power-law (PL) spectrum at the southern limb of the SNR best describes the detected gamma-ray emission. The photon index of the PL emission is $\Gamma\simeq 2.31$(or $\alpha\simeq 2.4$ in a Log-Parabola model) , softer than the previously reported $\Gamma\simeq 2.0$ when the counterpart to HESS~J1616$-$518 was considered to be a point source (which likely caused mis-identification of extended emission at RCW~103). In order to produce the \gr\ emission in a hadronic scenario, we estimate that protons with an index$\sim$2.4 PL energy distribution are needed. These results fit with those from multi-wavelength observations that have indicated the remnant at the southern limb is interacting with a molecular cloud.</description>

Detections at high energies ($0.1&lt;\mathrm{E}&lt;100$ GeV) of these distant sources are rare, but when they exhibit bright gamma-ray flares, we are able to study them. However, contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations of high-redshift objects ($z&gt;4$) during their different periods of activity have not been carried out so far. An excellent opportunity for such a study arose when the blazar TXS 1508+572 ($z=4.31$) exhibited a $\gamma$-ray flare in 2022 February in the $0.1-300$ GeV range with a flux 25 times brighter than the one reported in the in the fourth catalog of the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. Our goal is to monitor the morphological changes, spectral index and opacity variations that could be associated with the preceding $\gamma$-ray flare in TXS 1508+572 to find the origin of the high-energy emission in this source. We also plan to compare the source characteristics in the radio band to the blazars in the local Universe ($z&lt;0.1$). In addition, we aim to collect quasi-simultaneous data to our multi-wavelength observations of the object, making TXS 1508+572 the first blazar in the early Universe ($z&gt;4$) with contemporaneous multi-frequency data available in its high state. In order to study the parsec-scale structure of the source, we performed three epochs of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) follow-up observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) supplemented with the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope at 15, 22, and 43 GHz, which corresponds to 80, 117, and 228 GHz in the rest frame of TXS 1508+572. In addition, one 86 GHz (456 GHz) measurement was performed by the VLBA and the Green Bank Telescope during the first epoch.</description>

      <title>A generalization of photon sphere based on escape/capture cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In asymptotically flat spacetimes, bearing the null geodesics reaching the future null infinity in mind, we propose new concepts, the "dark horizons" as generalizations of the photon sphere. They are defined in terms of the structure of escape/capture cones of photons with respect to a unit timelike vector field. More specifically, considering a two-sphere that represents a set of emission directions of photons, the dark horizons are located at positions where a hemisphere is marginally included in the capture and escape cones, respectively. We show that both of them are absent in the Minkowski spacetime, while they exist in spacetimes with black hole(s) under a certain condition. We derive the general properties of the dark horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes and explicitly calculate the locations of the dark horizons in the Vaidya spacetime and the Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background: birth from string-wall death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new source of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from the final collapse of a network of topological defects. Typically, the final collapse is considered negligible for generating gravitational waves (GWs) due to its subdominance compared with the network's long-term evolution in the scaling regime. However, in some cases, a network can be driven outside of horizon by inflation and later re-enter horizon. Then, the network's final collapse after re-entering horizon becomes the dominant GW source and therefore cannot be neglected. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall networks which naturally arise in axion models, although the framework can be generalized to other types of topological networks. The final collapse of walls bounded by strings releases GWs. Our calculation of the corresponding GW spectrum suggests it could be related to the first few bins of the nano-Hertz SGWB signal possibly detected by various Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. However, it is important to note that such GW spectrum falls within a relatively narrow frequency range, which may not completely account for the PTA signal that spans more than one order of magnitude in frequency. Furthermore, with different parameter choices, the resultant GWs generated in this mechanism could be probed by various GW interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio of Binary Black Holes Determined from LIGO/Virgo Data Restricted to Small False Alarm Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on gravitational-wave events of binary black-hole mergers up to the third observing run with the minimum false alarm rate smaller than $10^{-5}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events tell us that the mass ratio of two black holes follows $m_2/m_1=0.723$ with the chance probability of 0.00301% for the chirp mass $M_{\rm chirp} &gt; 18\,M_{\odot}$. We show that the relation of $m_2/m_1=0.723$ is consistent with the binaries originated from population III stars which are the first stars in the universe. On the other hand, it is found for ${\rm chirp} &lt; 18 M_{\odot}$ that the mass ratio follows $m_2/m_1=0.601$ with the chance probability of 0.117% if we ignore GW190412 with $m_2/m_1\sim 0.32$. This suggests a different origin from that for $M_{\rm chirp} &gt; 18 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Damping of density oscillations from bulk viscosity in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the damping of density oscillations in the quark matter phase that might occur in compact stars. To this end we compute the bulk viscosity and the associated damping time in three-flavor quark matter, considering both nonleptonic and semileptonic electroweak processes. We use two different equations of state of quark matter, more precisely, the MIT bag model and perturbative QCD, including the leading-order corrections in the strong coupling constant. We analyze the dependence of our results on the density, temperature and value of strange quark mass in each case. We then find that the maximum of the bulk viscosity is in the range of temperature from 0.01 to 0.1 MeV for frequencies around 1 kHz, while the associated minimal damping times of the density oscillations at those temperatures might be in the range of few to hundreds milliseconds. Our results suggest that bulk viscous damping might be relevant in the postmerger phase after the collision of two neutron stars if deconfined matter is achieved in the process.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Cooling in Radiative Transfer Modeling of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code CMFGEN to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities $&lt;2000 \mathrm{km/s}$ where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at $\sim 4.5\mathrm{\mu m}$, which accounts for up to 20% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.</description>

      <title>Searching anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. One of the events could potentially come from a white dwarf. Some of them may originate from stellar flares, lightning, or be true anomalies, which are currently of an unknown type.</description>
