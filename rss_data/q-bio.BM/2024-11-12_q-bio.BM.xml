      <title>Polymerization and replication of primordial RNA explained by clay-water interface dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA is the only known biopolymer that combines genotype and phenotype in a single molecular entity. This has suggested that the flow of genetic information DNA-RNA-proteins already operating in LUCA could have been preceded by a primordial era when RNA was the genetic and catalytic macromolecule. However, understanding how RNA could have polymerized and subsequently replicated in early Earth remains challenging. We present a theoretical and computational framework to model the non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides and the template-dependent replication of primordial RNA molecules, at the interfaces between the aqueous solution and a clay mineral supplied by its interlayers and channels. Our results demonstrate that efficient polymerization and accurate replication of single-stranded RNA polymers, sufficiently long to fold and acquire basic functions ($&gt;15$ nt), were possible at clay-water interfaces in early Earth, provided the physico-chemical environment exhibited an oscillatory pattern of large amplitude and a period compatible with spring tide dynamics. Interestingly, the theoretical analysis presents rigorous evidence that RNA replication efficiency increases in oscillating environments compared to constant ones. Moreover, the versatility of our framework enables comparisons between different genetic alphabets, showing that a four-letter alphabet -- particularly when allowing non-canonical base pairs, as in current RNA -- represents an optimal balance of replication speed and sequence diversity in the pathway to life.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Protein Language Models: Leveraging Small Language Models with LoRA for Controllable Protein Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have shown promising results in other domains such as protein sequence generation. However, there remain salient differences between LLMs used for NLP, which effectively handle multiple tasks and are available in small sizes, and protein language models that are often specialized for specific tasks and only exist in larger sizes. In this work, we introduce two small protein language models, based on Llama-3-8B and Phi-3-mini, that are capable of both uncontrollable and controllable protein generation. For the uncontrollable generation task, our best model achieves an average pLDDT score of 69.75, demonstrating robust performance in generating viable protein structures. For the controllable generation task, in which the model generates proteins according to properties specified in the prompt, we achieve a remarkable average TM-Score of 0.84, indicating high structural similarity to target proteins. We chose 10 properties, including six classes of enzymes, to extend the capabilities of prior protein language models. Our approach utilizes the Low-Rank Adaptor (LoRA) technique, reducing trainable parameters to just 4% of the original model size, lowering computational requirements. By using a subset of the UniRef50 dataset and small models, we reduced the overall training time by 70% without compromising performance. Notably, Phi-3-mini reduced trainable parameters by 60%, decreasing training cost by 30% compared to Llama 3. Consequently, Phi-3 achieved a comparable TM-Score of 0.81, demonstrating that smaller models can match the performance of larger ones, like Llama 3. We also demonstrate the deployment of our models on the energy efficient ET-SoC-1 chip, significantly improving the TPS/W by a factor of 3.</description>

      <title>cgNA+min: computation of sequence-dependent dsDNA energy-minimising minicircle configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA minicircles are closed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments that have been demonstrated to be an important experimental tool to understand supercoiled, or stressed, DNA mechanics, such as nucleosome positioning and DNA-protein interactions. Specific minicircles can be simulated using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. However, the enormous sequence space makes it unfeasible to exhaustively explore the sequence-dependent mechanics of DNA minicircles using either experiment or MD. For linear fragments, the cgNA+ model, a computationally efficient sequence-dependent coarse-grained model using enhanced Curves+ internal coordinates (rigid base plus rigid phosphate) of double-stranded nucleic acids (dsNAs), predicts highly accurate nonlocal sequence-dependent equilibrium distributions for an arbitrary sequence when compared with MD simulations. This article addresses the problem of modeling sequence-dependent topologically closed and, therefore, stressed fragments of dsDNA. We introduce cgNA+min, a computational approach within the cgNA+ framework, which extends the cgNA+ model applicability to compute the sequence-dependent energy minimising configurations of covalently closed dsDNA minicircles of various lengths and linking numbers (Lk). The main idea is to derive the appropriate chain rule to express the cgNA+ energy in absolute coordinates involving quaternions where the closure condition is simple to handle. We also present a semi-analytic method for efficiently computing sequence-dependent initial minicircles having arbitrary Lk and length. For different classes and lengths of sequences, we demonstrate that the dsDNA minicircle energies computed using cgNA+min agree well with the energies approximated from experimentally measured J-factor values. Finally, we present the minicircle shape, energy, and multiplicity of Lk for more than 120K random DNA sequences of different lengths.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Allostery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental property of proteins that represents the functional coupling between distantly located sites. In different manifestations, this property underlies signal transduction, gene expression, and regulation -- elementary reactions in networks comprising cellular information and metabolic processing systems. In this work, we present a reduced theoretical model for allostery that encompasses the many diverse mechanisms described in past work. What emerges is a basic classification of different forms of allostery into two groups: those that couple distant sites through soft normal modes within a single state, and those that possess multiple states, with effective interactions between sites emerging only upon transitioning between these states. This work serves to unify the extensive past theoretical work on the phenomenology and machinery of allostery in proteins.</description>

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.</description>
