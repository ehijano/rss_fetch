      <title>Efficient Circuit-Based Quantum State Tomography via Sparse Entry Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient circuit-based quantum state tomography (QST) scheme to reconstruct $n$-qubit states with $k$ nonzero entries using measurements of $|\psi\rangle$ and $U_1|\psi\rangle, \dots, U_{2m}|\psi\rangle$, where $m \le k$. Each $U_j$ involves CNOT gates followed by a single-qubit gate, either Hadamard $H$ or $HD$, where $D = {\rm diag}(1,i)$, targeting a specific qubit. We provide an upper limit on the number of CNOT gates based on the nonzero entries' positions in $|\psi\rangle$. This approach, applied to both state and process tomography, was tested using the Qiskit simulator.</description>

      <title>Trusted source noise model of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution offers a pragmatic solution, greatly simplifying experimental procedures while retaining robust integration with classical optical communication. Theoretical analyses have progressively validated the comprehensive security of this protocol, paving the way for practical experimentation. However, imperfect source in practical implementations introduce noise. The traditional approach is to assume that eavesdroppers can control all of the source noise, which overestimates the ability of eavesdroppers and underestimates secret key rate. In fact, some parts of source noise are intrinsic and cannot be manipulated by eavesdropper, so they can be seen as trusted noise. We tailor a trusted model specifically for the discrete-modulated protocol and upgrade the security analysis accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach successfully mitigates negative impact of imperfect source on system performance while maintaining security of the protocol. Furthermore, our method can be used in conjunction with trusted detector noise model, effectively reducing the influence of both source and detector noise in experimental setup. This is a meaningful contribution to the practical deployment of discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Quantum Trajectories in the Monitored Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitored quantum system have sparked great interest in recent years due to the possibility of observing measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in the full-counting statistics of the quantum trajectories associated with different measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, composed of $N$ all-to-all interacting spins $1/2$, under a weak external monitoring. We derive a set of semiclassical stochastic equations describing the evolution of the expectation values of global spin observables, which become exact in the thermodynamic limit. Our results shows that the limit $N\to\infty$ does not commute with the long-time limit: while for any finite $N$ the esamble average over the noise is expected to converge towards a trivial steady state, in the thermodynamic limit a MIPT appears. The transition is not affected by post-selection issues, as it is already visible at the level of ensemble averages, thus paving the way for experimental observations. We derive a quantitative theoretical picture explaining the nature of the transition within our semiclassical picture, finding an excellent agreement with the numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lecture notes on "Many-body Quantum Dynamics with MCTDH-X," adapted from the 2023 Heidelberg MCTDH Summer School, provide an in-depth exploration of the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree approach for indistinguishable particles. They serve as a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the MCTDH-X software for both bosonic and fermionic systems. The tutorial begins with an introduction to the MCTDH-X software, highlighting its capability to handle various quantum systems, including those with internal degrees of freedom and long-range interactions. The theoretical foundation is then laid out on how to solve the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equations for many-body systems. The workflow section provides practical instructions on setting up and executing simulations using MCTDH-X. Detailed benchmarks against exact solutions are presented, showcasing the accuracy and reliability of the software in ground-state and dynamic simulations. The notes then delve into the dynamics of quantum systems, covering relaxation processes, time evolution, and the analysis of propagation for both bosonic and fermionic particles. The discussion includes the interpretation of various physical quantities such as energy, density distributions, and orbital occupations. Advanced features of MCTDH-X are also explored in the last section, including the calculation of correlation functions and the creation of visualizations through video tutorials. The notes conclude with a Linux/UNIX command cheat sheet, facilitating ease of use for users operating the software on different systems. Overall, these lecture notes provide a valuable resource for researchers and students in the field of quantum dynamics, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance on the use of MCTDH-X for studying complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Realizaiton of high-fidelity perfect entangler between remote superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers from smaller modules offers a solution to many formidable scientific and engineering challenges. Nevertheless, engineering high-fidelity interconnects between modules remains challenging. In recent years, quantum state transfer (QST) has provided a way to establish entanglement between two separately packaged quantum devices. However, QST is not a unitary gate, thus cannot be directly inserted into a quantum circuit, which is widely used in recent quantum computation studies. Here we report a demonstration of a direct CNOT gate realized by the cross resonance (CR) effect between two remotely packaged quantum devices connected by a microwave cable. We achieve a CNOT gate with fidelity as high as $99.15 \pm 0.02\%$. The quality of the CNOT gate is verified by cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) and further confirmed by demonstrating Bell-inequality violation. This work provides a new method to realize remote two-qubit gates. Our method can be used not only to achieve distributed quantum computing but also to enrich the topology of superconducting quantum chips with jumper lines connecting distant qubits. This advancement gives superconducting qubits broader application prospects in the fields of quantum computing and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Local Friendliness Polytopes In Multipartite Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Local Friendliness (LF) no-go theorem has gained a lot of attention, owing to its deep foundational implications. This no-go theorem applies to scenarios which combine Bell experiments with Wigner's friend-type set ups, containing space-like separated superobservers who are assumed to be capable of performing quantum operations on a local observer, also known as their "friend". Analogously to the hypothesis of local hidden variables in Bell scenarios, a set of assumptions termed "Local Friendliness" constrains the space of probabilistic behaviours accessible to the superobservers to be a particular subset of the no-signalling polytope in such scenarios. It has additionally been shown, that there are scenarios where the set of behaviours compatible with Local Friendliness is strictly larger than the Bell-local polytope, while in some scenarios those sets are equal. In this work, we complete the picture by identifying all the canonical Local Friendliness scenarios, with arbitrary but finite numbers of superobservers, friends, measurements and outcomes, where the set of LF correlations admits a local hidden variable model, and where they do not. Our proof is constructive in the sense that we also demonstrate how a local hidden variable model can be constructed, given a behaviour compatible with LF in the appropriate scenarios. While our principal motivation is the foundational question of better understanding the constraints from Local Friendliness, the same inequalities constraining LF polytopes have been shown to arise in a priori unrelated contexts of device-independent information processing. Our results may thus find use in those research areas as well.</description>

      <title>Experimental quantum-enhanced kernels on a photonic processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine learning had a remarkable impact, from scientific to everyday-life applications. However, complex tasks often imply unfeasible energy and computational power consumption. Quantum computation might lower such requirements, although it is unclear whether enhancements are reachable by current technologies. Here, we demonstrate a kernel method on a photonic integrated processor to perform a binary classification. We show that our protocol outperforms state-of-the-art kernel methods including gaussian and neural tangent kernels, exploiting quantum interference, and brings a smaller improvement also by single photon coherence. Our scheme does not require entangling gates and can modify the system dimension through additional modes and injected photons. This result opens to more efficient algorithms and to formulating tasks where quantum effects improve standard methods.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, volume-law states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing two-qubit, universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone. Furthermore, this method should also--at least, in principle--be generalizable to systems of neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Mutual information chain rules for security proofs robust against device imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derive a number of chain rules for mutual information quantities, suitable for analyzing quantum cryptography with imperfect devices that leak additional information to an adversary. First, we derive a chain rule between smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over previous chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by an additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an ''information bounding theorem'' that bounds the R\'enyi mutual information of a state produced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the R\'enyi mutual information of the individual channel outputs, similar to entropy accumulation theorems. In particular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the preceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between R\'enyi entropies and R\'enyi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy accumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in each round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some device imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent protocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>Discrete-outcome sensor networks: Multiple detection events and grouping detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensor networks have often been studied in order to determine how accurately they can determine a parameter, such as the strength of a magnetic field, at one of the detectors. A more coarse-grained approach is to try to simply determine whether a detector has interacted with a signal or not, and which detector it was. Such discrete-outcome quantum sensor networks, discrete in the sense that we are seeking answers to yes-no questions, are what we study here. One issue is what is a good initial state for the network, and, in particular, should it be entangled or not. Earlier we looked at the case when only one detector interacted, and here we extend that study in two ways. First, we allow more that one detector to interact, and second, we examine the effect of grouping the detectors. When the detectors are grouped we are only interested in which group contained interacting detectors and not in which individual detectors within a group interacted. We find that in the case of grouping detectors, entangled initial states can be helpful.</description>

      <title>Resilient Entanglement Distribution in a Multihop Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum networking requires architectures capable of dynamically reconfigurable entanglement distribution to meet diverse user needs and ensure tolerance against transmission disruptions. We introduce multihop quantum networks to improve network reach and resilience by enabling quantum communications across intermediate nodes, thus broadening network connectivity and increasing scalability. We present multihop two-qubit polarization-entanglement distribution within a quantum network at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory campus. Our system uses wavelength-selective switches for adaptive bandwidth management on a software-defined quantum network that integrates a quantum data plane with classical data and control planes, creating a flexible, reconfigurable mesh. Our network distributes entanglement across six nodes within three subnetworks, each located in a separate building, optimizing quantum state fidelity and transmission rate through adaptive resource management. Additionally, we demonstrate the network's resilience by implementing a link recovery approach that monitors and reroutes quantum resources to maintain service continuity despite link failures -- paving the way for scalable and reliable quantum networking infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum HodgeRank: Topology-Based Rank Aggregation on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank aggregation techniques play a crucial role in identifying the best alternatives, but the inherent imbalance and incompleteness of real-world data pose significant challenges. The HodgeRank algorithm, which utilizes discrete exterior calculus on a graph, can overcome these issues and output a consistent global ranking of alternatives. Recently, higher-order networks have been employed to analyze complex multipartite interactions in network data. Extending HodgeRank to ranking on higher-order networks, however, requires computational costs that are exponential in the network dimension. To address this challenge, we develop a quantum algorithm that outputs a quantum state proportional to the HodgeRank solution. By incorporating quantum singular value transformation and tools from quantum topological data analysis, our approach achieves time complexity independent of the network dimension, avoiding the need for quantum random access memory or sparse access input models. We also present efficient algorithms and heuristics to extract meaningful information from the output quantum state, including an algorithm to compute the consistency of the ranking. Using our algorithm, the consistency measure estimation has the potential to achieve superpolynomial quantum speedups for higher-order network data with specific structures. Beyond ranking tasks, our methods suggest that quantum computing could find fruitful applications in studying higher-order networks and discrete exterior calculus.</description>

      <title>On a Matrix Ensemble for Arbitrary Complex Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive analytical exploration of a variation of the eigenvector ensemble initially proposed by Deutsch for the foundations of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) that drastically (but not fully) increases system-dependent information, and therefore serves as a model for the study of complex quantum systems beyond the universal Random Matrix Theory (RMT) regime. We especially focus on the remnants of system-specific information that modify the late-time behavior of correlation functions like the spectral form factor, or the inclusion of explicit system-dependent Hamiltonian corrections not captured by the RMT regime. The consistency of the predictions in the new ensemble with respect to the universal (Haar) one is made explicit by showing how that for arbitrary systems it defines an unitary 1-design and for strongly chaotic systems it becomes an approximated 2-design. While we are able to provide universal expressions for two- and four-point ensemble-averaged correlation functions and show how system-dependent information is spectrally decoupled, we also show that for small energy windows correlation functions defined by the new ensemble reduce to the predictions of the ETH.</description>

      <title>Stronger sum uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the uncertainty relationships of two arbitrary incompatible observables represented by the product of variances in the past, representing them by the sum of variances is better as it guarantees to be nontrivial for two incompatible operators in some special cases. Although the uncertainty relation is formulated as the sum of variances for unitary operators has been confirmed, its general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not been yet investigated in detail. Thus, this study develops four sum uncertainty relations for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators acting on system states by utilizing an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via $G$-metric formalism. Concrete examples demonstrate the validity of the purposed sum uncertainty relations in both $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phases. The proposed methods and results can help the reader to understand in-depth the usefulness of $G$-metric formalism in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum uncertainty relations of incompatible operators within.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of long-range entanglement in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A macroscopic energy barrier is a necessary condition for self-correcting quantum memory. In this paper, we prove tight bounds on the energy barrier applicable to any quantum code obtained from the hypergraph product of two classical codes. If the underlying classical codes are low-density parity-check codes (LDPC), the energy barrier of the quantum code is shown to be the minimum energy barrier of the underlying classical codes (and their transposes) up to an additive $O(1)$ constant.</description>

      <title>Local-Data-Hiding and Causal Inseparability: Probing Indefinite Causal Structures with Cryptographic Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulation of physical theories typically assumes a definite causal structure -- either static or dynamic -- among the set of physical events. Recent studies, however, suggest the possibility of indefiniteness in causal structure, which emerges as a novel information primitive offering advantages in various protocols. In this work, we explore utilities of this new primitive in cryptographic applications. To this aim, we propose a task called local-data-hiding, where a referee distributes encrypted messages among distant parties in such a way that the parties individually remain completely ignorant about the messages, and thus try to decrypt their respective messages through mutual collaboration. As we demonstrate, agents embedded in an indefinite causal structure can outperform their counterparts operating in a definite causal background. Considering the bipartite local-bit-hiding (LBH) task, we establish a strict duality between its optimal success probability and the optimal violation of a causal inequality obtained from the guess-your-neighbour's-input game. This, in turn, provides a way forward to obtain Tsirelson-type bounds for causal inequalities. Furthermore, similar to Peres's separability criterion, we derive a necessary criterion for quantum processes to be useful in the LBH task. We then report an intriguing super-activation phenomenon, where two quantum processes, each individually not useful for the LBH task, become useful when used together. We also analyze the utility of causal indefiniteness arising in classical setups and show its advantages in multipartite variants of the local-data-hiding task. Along with establishing new cryptographic applications our study illuminates various unexplored aspects of causal indefiniteness, and welcomes further studies on this new information primitive.</description>

      <title>Radiative pumping vs vibrational relaxation of molecular polaritons: a bosonic mapping approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism to study molecular polaritons in the collective regime, based on the bosonization of molecular vibronic states. This formalism accommodates an arbitrary number of molecules $N$, excitations and internal vibronic structures, making it ideal for investigating molecular polariton processes beyond the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit (i.e., accounting for finite $N$ effects), both numerically and analytically. Here, we employ this formalism to rigorously derive radiative pumping and vibrational relaxation rates, and establish the fundamental differences between these mechanisms. We show that radiative pumping is the emission from incoherent excitons and divide its rate into transmitted and re-absorbed components. On the other hand, the vibrational relaxation rate in the weak linear vibronic coupling regime is composed of two components: a $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ contribution already accounted for by radiative pumping, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$ contribution from a second-order process in the \textit{single}-molecule light-matter coupling that we identify as a polariton-assisted Raman scattering. We demonstrate that vibrational relaxation via this scattering is enhanced when the energy difference between the emission and the lower polariton transition corresponds to the vibrational excitation created in the Raman process.</description>

      <title>Advance Sharing Procedures for the Ramp Quantum Secret Sharing Schemes With the Highest Coding Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some quantum secret sharing schemes, it is known that some shares can be distributed to participants before a secret is given to the dealer. However, it is unclear whether some shares can be distributed before a secret is given in the ramp quantum secret sharing schemes with the highest coding rate. In this paper, we propose methods to distribute some shares before a secret is given in those schemes, then we prove that our new encoding procedures retain the correspondences between quantum secrets and quantum shares in the original schemes.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on the Use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Compute the Spectrum of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are of great interest for many research areas, including physics, biology and chemistry. However, their simulation is extremely challenging, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size, making it exceedingly difficult to parameterize the wave functions of large systems by using exact methods. Neural networks and machine learning in general are a way to face this challenge. For instance, methods like Tensor networks and Neural Quantum States are being investigated as promising tools to obtain the wave function of a quantum mechanical system. In this tutorial, we focus on a particularly promising class of deep learning algorithms. We explain how to construct a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) able to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for a given potential, by finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored. PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by an AI agent due to the presence of complex-valued eigenfunctions and degenerate states.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear response of telecom-wavelength superconducting single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the nonlinearity of a telecom-wavelength superconducting nanowire single-photon detector via incoherent beam combination. At typical photon count rates and detector bias current, the observed relative deviation from a perfectly linear response is in the order of 0.1% when the flux is doubled. This arises from a balance between the counteracting nonlinearities of deadtime-induced detector saturation and of multi-photon detections. The observed behaviour is modelled empirically, which suffices for a correction of measured data. In addition, statistical simulations, taking into account the measured recovery of the detection efficiency, provide insight into possible mechanisms of multi-photon detection.</description>

      <title>Controlling superradiant phase transition in quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ultrastrong-coupling regime, the quantum Rabi model can exhibit quantum phase transition (QPT) when the ratio of the qubit transition frequency to the frequency of the cavity field approaches infinity. However, it is challenging to control the QPT in few-body systems because of the limited coupling strength and the A^2 terms. Here, we propose a practical scheme to manipulate the QPT of quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime. By applying a periodic frequency modulation to the two-level system in a standard quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime, an anisotropic quantum Rabi model with ultrastrong and tunable coupling strengths for rotating and counter-rotating terms is obtained. The ground-state and excitation energy of this model in terms of the modulation parameters are studied. We find that the QPT of quantum Rabi model can be observed in the strong-coupling regime and externally controlled by the modulation.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multidimensional Variational Measurement with Non-Symmetric Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broadband multidimensional variational measurement allows overcoming the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of a classical mechanical force detection for a mechanical oscillator. In this measurement quantum back action, which perturbs the evolution of a mechanical oscillator, can be completely removed in a broad detection frequency band after post-processing. The measurement is performed by optical pumping of the central optical mode and analyzing the light escaping the two other optical modes, which have the frequency separation with the central mode equal to the mechanical frequency. To realize such a scheme in practice one either needs to use a very long optical interferometer or should utilize optical modes belonging to different mode families. In the second case the modes have different geometries and their coupling with the mechanical mode is not identical. Here we analyze a general case of the non-symmetric measurement scheme, in which the coupling strengths with the light modes are not equal to each other, and take into account optical losses. We found that the back action can be completely excluded from the measurement result in the case of the asymmetric lossless system. The nonzero loss limits the sensitivity. An experimental implementation of the proposed scheme is discussed.</description>

      <title>Architectural Influence on Variational Quantum Circuits in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Evolutionary Strategies for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has found application in numerous areas of science and industry, such as autonomous driving, telecommunications, and global health. Nevertheless, MARL suffers from, for instance, an exponential growth of dimensions. Inherent properties of quantum mechanics help to overcome these limitations, e.g., by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Previous studies have developed an approach that uses gradient-free quantum Reinforcement Learning and evolutionary optimization for variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to reduce the trainable parameters and avoid barren plateaus as well as vanishing gradients. This leads to a significantly better performance of VQCs compared to classical neural networks with a similar number of trainable parameters and a reduction in the number of parameters by more than 97 \% compared to similarly good neural networks. We extend an approach of K\"olle et al. by proposing a Gate-Based, a Layer-Based, and a Prototype-Based concept to mutate and recombine VQCs. Our results show the best performance for mutation-only strategies and the Gate-Based approach. In particular, we observe a significantly better score, higher total and own collected coins, as well as a superior own coin rate for the best agent when evaluated in the Coin Game environment.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic dependence of the radiation linewidth in a phonon laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phonon laser is an important device that can generate coherent sound waves at gigahertz frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate that in a phonon laser, the radiation line width can depend on the pumping non-monotonically. This is because there are two different types of solutions whose spectra depend differently on the noise amplitude. The first solution is a zero solution, which is stable before the generation threshold and is nondegenerate. The second solution is a nonzero solution that is stable above the generation threshold and is degenerate with respect to the phase. The line width of peaks in the spectrum of the zero solution does not depend on the noise amplitude. While, the line width of the peak in the spectrum of the nonzero solution increases with increasing noise amplitude. The noise amplitude increases with temperature, and, as a result, there is a temperature above which the transition from the zero solution to the nonzero solution leads to an increase in the radiation line width. In this case, the radiation line width non-monotonically depends on the pumping.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries in prethermal phases of periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven closed quantum systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature reaching a steady state described by a circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). However, such finite driven systems may exhibit sufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are qualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states. These, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of phenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet scars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time crystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent approximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature of these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of a class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cat qubits have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum computation due to their higher error-correction thresholds and low resource overheads. In existing literature, the detuning of the two-photon drive is assumed to be zero for implementing single and multi-qubit gates. We explore a modification of the Hamiltonian for a range of detuning and demonstrate that high fidelity single qubit gates can be performed even by proper parameter matching. We also analyze the CNOT gate in presence of an approximate detuning term and explain its fidelity improvements through Shortcut to Adiabaticity corrections.</description>

      <title>On multivariate polynomials achievable with quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a framework which was proven to unify and simplify a large number of known quantum algorithms, as well as discovering new ones. QSP allows one to transform a signal embedded in a given unitary using polynomials. Characterizing which polynomials can be achieved with QSP protocols is an important part of the power of this technique, and while such a characterization is well-understood in the case of univariate signals, it is unclear which multivariate polynomials can be constructed when the signal is a vector, rather than a scalar. This work uses a slightly different formalism than what is found in the literature, and uses it to find simpler necessary conditions for decomposability, as well as a sufficient condition - the first, to the best of our knowledge, proven for a (generally inhomogeneous) multivariate polynomial in the context of quantum signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantization of the Kramers-Kronig (KK) detection technique, initially developed for classical coherent communications. This detection method involves combining the state of interest with a local oscillator on an unbalanced beamsplitter, followed by direct detection and digital signal processing. Intensity measurements in the case of spectrally engineered fields allow for the "digital measurement" of the phase of classical and quantum fields. We show that, to the first order of the local oscillator's amplitude, KK detection is a Gaussian measurement that allows for the estimation of both quadratures of the electric field, similar to double homodyne detection. We study in detail how KK detection operates in the case of bosonic coherent states, pure single-mode and mixed states, as well as the nature of the phase information it measures. Finally, we propose an alternative spectral tomography technique for single-photon states inspired by KK detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently measuring nonlinear properties, like the entanglement spectrum, is a significant yet challenging task from quantum information processing to many-body physics. Current methodologies often suffer from an exponential scaling of the sampling cost or require auxiliary qubits and deep quantum circuits. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient auxiliary-free replica shadow (AFRS) framework, which leverages the power of the joint entangling operation on a few input replicas while integrating the mindset of shadow estimation. We rigorously prove that AFRS can offer exponential improvements in estimation accuracy compared with the conventional shadow method, and facilitate the simultaneous estimation of various nonlinear properties, unlike the destructive swap test. Additionally, we introduce an advanced local-AFRS variant tailored to estimating local observables with even constant-depth local quantum circuits, which significantly simplifies the experimental realization compared with the general swap test. Our work paves the way for the application of AFRS on near-term quantum hardware, opening new avenues for efficient and practical quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in Discrete-Time Open Quantum Random Walk on Arbitrary Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model of the Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walk (DTOQW) applicable to an arbitrary graph, thereby going beyond the case of quantum walks on regular graphs. The impact of noise is studied by constructing Kraus operators of different dimensions, making use of the Weyl operators. These Kraus operators are employed as the coin operators of the DTOQW. The walker dynamics is studied under the impact of non-Markovian amplitude damping, depolarizing and dephasing noise channels. In addition, the walk is implemented on arbitrary graphs, such as path graph, cycle graph, star graph, complete graph, and complete bipartite graph. The dynamics, due to the influence of noise, is gauged by computing the coherence and fidelity at different time steps. Further, the probability distribution, representing the availability of the quantum walker at different vertices of the graph, is computed at different time steps for the above noises.</description>

      <title>Parallel ergotropy: Maximum work extraction via parallel local unitary operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum quantum work extraction is generally defined in terms of the ergotropy functional, no matter how experimentally complicated is the implementation of the optimal unitary allowing for it, especially in the case of multipartite systems. In this framework, we consider a quantum battery made up of many interacting sub-systems and study the maximum extractable work via concurrent local unitary operations on each subsystem. We call the resulting functional parallel ergotropy. Focusing on the bipartite case, we first observe that parallel ergotropy outperforms work extraction via egoistic strategies, in which the first agent A extracts locally on its part the maximum available work and the second agent B, subsequently, extracts what is left on the other part. For the agents, this showcases the need of cooperating for an overall benefit. Secondly, from the informational point of view, we observe that the parallel capacity of a state can detect entanglement and compare it with the statistical entanglement witness that exploits fluctuations of stochastic work extraction. Additionally, we face the technical problem of computing parallel ergotropy. We derive analytical upper bounds for specific classes of states and Hamiltonians and provide receipts to obtain numerical upper bounds via semi-definite programming in the generic case. Finally, extending the concept of parallel ergotropy, we demonstrate that system's free-time evolution and application of local unitaries allow one to saturate the gap with the ergotropy of the whole system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermionic linear optical (FLO) extent is a quantity that serves two roles, firstly it serves as a measure of the "quantumness" (or non-classicality) of quantum circuits. Secondly it controls the runtime of a class of classical simulation algorithms, which are state-of-the-art for simulating quantum circuits formed mostly of FLO unitaries and promoted to universality by the addition of ``magic states''. It is therefore interesting to understand the scaling behaviour of the extent as magic states are added to a circuit. In this work we solve this problem for the case of $4$-qubit parity eigenstates. We show that the FLO extent of a tensor product of any pure state and a $4$ qubit parity eigenstate is the product of the extents of the two tensor factors. Applying this result recursively one proves a conjecture that the extent is multiplicative for arbitrary tensor products of $4$ qubit magic states.</description>

      <title>Non-classical excitation of a solid-state quantum emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between a single emitter and a single photon is a fundamental aspect of quantum optics. This interaction allows for the study of various quantum processes, such as emitter-mediated single-photon scattering and effective photon-photon interactions. However, empirical observations of this scenario and its dynamics are rare, and in most cases, only partial approximations to the fully quantized case have been possible. Here, we demonstrate the resonant excitation of a solid-state quantum emitter using quantized input light. For this light-matter interaction, with both entities quantized, we observe single-photon interference introduced by the emitter in a coherent scattering process, photon-number-depended optical non-linearities, and stimulated emission processes involving only two photons. We theoretically reproduce our observations using a cascaded master equation model. Our findings demonstrate that a single photon is sufficient to change the state of a solid-state quantum emitter, and efficient emitter-mediated photon-photon interactions are feasible. These results suggest future possibilities ranging from enabling quantum information transfer in a quantum network to building deterministic entangling gates for photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Superconducting Quantum Networks Using Multi-Octave Transduction to Lower Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose networking superconducting quantum circuits by transducing their excitations (typically 4-8 GHz) to 100-500 MHz photons for transmission via cryogenic coaxial cables. Counter-intuitively, this frequency downconversion reduces noise and transmission losses. We introduce a multi-octave asymmetrically threaded SQUID circuit (MOATS) capable of the required efficient, high-rate transduction. For a 100-meter cable with $Q_i = 10^5$ at 10 mK, our approach achieves single-photon fidelities of 0.962 at 200 MHz versus 0.772 at 8 GHz, and triples the lower bound on quantum channel capacity. This method enables kilometer-scale quantum links while maintaining high fidelities, combining improved performance with the practical advantages of flexible, compact coaxial cables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms are prominent in the pursuit of achieving quantum advantage in various computational tasks. However, addressing challenges, such as limited qubit coherence and high error rate in near-term devices, requires extensive efforts. In this paper, we present a substantial stride in quantum chemistry by integrating shortcuts-to-adiabaticity techniques into adiabatic and variational algorithms for calculating the molecular ground state. Our approach includes the counter-diabatic driving that accelerates adiabatic evolution by mitigating adiabatic errors. Additionally, we introduce the counter-diabatic terms as the adiabatic gauge ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver, which exhibits favorable convergence properties with a fewer number of parameters, thereby reducing the circuit depth. Our approach achieves comparable accuracy to other established ansatzes, while enhancing the potential for applications in material science, drug discovery, and molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>An iterative transversal CNOT decoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern platforms for potential qubit candidates, such as trapped ions or neutral atoms, allow long range connectivity between distant physical qubits through shuttling. This opens up an avenue for transversal logical CNOT gates between distant logical qubits, whereby physical CNOT gates are performed between each corresponding physical qubit on the control and target logical qubits. However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical qubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits. We have developed a multi-pass iterative decoder that decodes each logical qubit separately to deal with this correlated error. We show that under circuit-level noise and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles, a threshold can still persist, and the logical error rate will not be significantly degraded, matching the sub-threshold logical error rate scaling of $p^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ for a distance $d$ rotated surface code.</description>

      <title>Engineering photonic band gaps with a waveguide-QED structure containing an atom-polymer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation and engineering of photonic band gaps in waveguide quantum electrodynamics systems containing periodically arranged atom-polymers. We first consider the configuration of a dimer array coupled to a waveguide. The results show that if the intra- and inter-cell phase delays are properly designed, the center and the width of the band gaps, as well as the dispersion relation of the passbands can be modified by adjusting the intra-cell coupling strength. These manipulations provide ways to control the propagating modes in the waveguide, leading to some interesting effects such as slowing or even stopping a single-photon pulse. Finally, we take the case of the tetramer chain as an example to show that, in the case of a larger number of atoms in each unit cell, tunable multi-gap structures and more sophisticated band-gap engineering can be realized. Our proposal provides efficient ways for photonic band-gap engineering in micro- and nano-quantum systems, which may facilitate the manipulation of photon transport in future quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Thermalization propagation front and robustness against avalanches in localized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the many-body localized (MBL) phase to the quantum-avalanche instability by studying the dynamics of a localized spin chain coupled to a $T=\infty$ thermal bath through its leftmost site. By analyzing local magnetizations and quantum mutual information, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector of the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This logarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower bound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where it scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against thermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on Integrated High-Performance Computing and Quantum Computing Systems for Large-Scale Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum approximated optimization algorithm (QAOA) has shown promise for solving combinatorial optimization problems by providing quantum speedup on near-term gate-based quantum computing systems. However, QAOA faces challenges in optimizing variational parameters for high-dimensional problems due to the large number of qubits required and the complexity of deep circuits, which limit its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we propose a distributed QAOA (DQAOA), which leverages a high-performance computing-quantum computing (HPC-QC) integrated system. DQAOA leverages distributed computing strategies to decompose a large job into smaller tasks, which are then processed on the HPC-QC system. The global solution is iteratively updated by aggregating sub-solutions obtained from DQAOA, allowing convergence toward the optimal solution. We demonstrate that DQAOA can handle considerably large-scale optimization problems (e.g., 1,000-bit problem) achieving high accuracy (~99%) and short time-to-solution (~276 s). To apply this algorithm to material science, we further develop an active learning algorithm integrated with our DQAOA (AL-DQAOA), which involves machine learning, DQAOA, and active data production in an iterative loop. We successfully optimize photonic structures using AL-DQAOA, indicating that solving real-world optimization problems using gate-based quantum computing is feasible with our strategies. We expect the proposed DQAOA to be applicable to a wide range of optimization problems and AL-DQAOA to find broader applications in material design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently developed viewpoint on the fundamentals of density-functional theory for finite interacting spin-lattice systems that centers around the notion of degeneracy regions is presented. It allows for an entirely geometrical description of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and v-representability. The phenomena receive exemplification by an Anderson impurity model and other small-lattice examples. The case of adiabatic change and the time-dependent setting are examined as well.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in bosons via quantum resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r\, \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get $\rm{\textit{strongly correlated}}$ due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.</description>

      <title>Complete three-dimensional vector polarimetry with a Rydberg atom rf electrometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (rf) receivers using Rydberg atoms offer appealing features over classical sensors, such as their size, frequency tuning range, and lack of field absorption. In this work, we extend the application space by demonstrating a Rydberg atom rf polarimeter. Using rf heterodyne with three independent and orthogonal local oscillators, we are able to extract the polarization ellipse of the field in three dimensions, in addition to the total amplitude of the field. We use the relative phases and amplitudes of the three generated heterodyne signals to measure the field amplitudes and phases along three cardinal axes giving the full three-dimensional polarization. We demonstrate this polarization measurement for incoming fields at different angles around the sensor. Lastly, we investigate the reception of data symbols encoded in the horizontal and vertical signal field polarizations and the phase between them. Our measurements yield an amplitude noise of 57 $\mu$V/m/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for horizontal polarization, 66 $\mu$V/m/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for vertical polarization, and a standard deviation of 0.094 rad in the phase between the field components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I suggest that the current situation in quantum field theory (QFT) provides some reason to question the universal validity of ontological reductionism. I argue that the renormalization group flow is reversible except at fixed points, which makes the relation between large and small distance scales quite symmetric in QFT, opening up at least the technical possibility of a non-reductionist approach to QFT. I suggest that some conceptual problems encountered within QFT may potentially be mitigated by moving to an alternative picture in which it is no longer the case that the large supervenes on the small. Finally, I explore some specific models in which a form of non-reductionism might be implemented, and consider the prospects for future development of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we seek to understand what current knowledge of entanglement entropies suggests about the appropriate way to interpret the covariant entropy bound. We first begin by arguing that just as in the classical case, a universal bound on the von Neumann entropy could have either an epistemic or ontological origin. We then consider several possible ways of explaining the bound as a consequence of features of the entanglement entropy. We discuss consider area laws in condensed matter and quantum field theory, arguing that they suggest an epistemic reading of the bound. We also discuss the 'spacetime from entanglement' programme, arguing that entanglement alone may not be able to full ground spacetime topology, but it could potentially play a role in determining the spacetime metric, in which case it would potentially support a more ontological reading of the bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of transmitted photons in microwave cavities play a foundational role in microwave quantum optics and its technological applications. By utilizing quantum mechanical phase-space methods, we here develop a general theory of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks consisting of driven cavities with beamsplitter interactions and two-mode-squeezing. The dynamics of the network can be captured by a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the cavity fields, which generalizes to a Riccati equation, when counting fields are included. By solving the Riccati equation, we obtain the statistics of emitted and absorbed photons as well as the time-dependent correlations encoded in waiting time distributions and second-order coherence functions. To illustrate our theoretical framework, we first apply it to a simple linear network consisting of two coupled cavities, for which we evaluate the photon cross-correlations and discuss connections between the photon emission statistics and the entanglement between the cavities. We then consider a bosonic circulator consisting of three coupled cavities, for which we investigate how a synthetic flux may affect the direction of the photon flow, similarly to recent experiments. Our general framework paves the way for systematic investigations of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and engineering the coupling of spins in nanomaterials is of central importance for designing novel devices. Graphene nanostructures with {\pi}-magnetism offer a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetic interactions. However, realizing spin chains bearing controlled odd-even effects with suitable nanographene systems is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the successful on-surface synthesis of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with parity-dependent magnetization based on antiaromatic diaza-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (diaza-HBC) units. Using distinct synthetic strategies, two types of spin chains with different terminals were synthesized, both exhibiting a robust odd-even effect on the spin coupling along the chain. Combined investigations using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and quantum spin models confirmed the structures of the diaza-HBC chains and revealed their magnetic properties, which has an S = 1/2 spin per unit through electron donation from the diaza-HBC core to the Au(111) substrate. Gapped excitations were observed in even-numbered chains, while enhanced Kondo resonance emerged in odd-numbered units of odd-numbered chains due to the redistribution of the unpaired spin along the chain. Our findings provide an effective strategy to construct nanographene spin chains and unveil the odd-even effect in their magnetic properties, offering potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We study the Krylov state complexity of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for $N \le 26$ Majorana fermions with $q$-body interaction with $q=4,6,8$ for a range of sparse parameter $k$. Using the peak of the Krylov complexity as a probe, we find change in behavior as we vary $k$ for various $q$. We argue that this captures the change from holographic to non-holographic behavior in the sparse SYK-type models such that model is holographic for all $k \ge k_{\text{min}}$. Our results also indicate that the Krylov complexity peak has a holographic interpretation similar to the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

Abstract: Multifractality of quantum states plays an important role for understanding numerous complex phenomena observed in different branches of physics. The multifractal properties of the eigenstates allow for charactering various phase transitions. In this work, we perform a thoroughly analysis of the impacts of an excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) on the fractal behavior of both static and dynamical wavefunctions in a ferromagentic spin-$1$ Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).By studying the features of the fractal dimensions, we show how the multifractality of eigenstates and time evolved state are affected by the presence of ESQPT. Specifically, the underlying ESQPT leads to a strong localization effect, which in turn enables us to use it as an indicator of ESQPT. We verify the ability of the fractal dimensions to probe the occurrence of ESQPT through a detailed scaling analysis. We also discuss how the ESQPT manifests itself in the fractal dimensions of the long-time averaged state. Our findings further confirm that the multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for studying of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems and also hint an potential application of ESQPTs in burgeoning field of state preparation engineering.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole spin resonance with linear and cubic spin-orbit interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) with using the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in GaAs and Ge based quantum dots formed in a quantum well. We use Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and rotating frame to derive the effective Hamiltonian of EDSR. We treat the couplings of the orbital motion with the environment with Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. We found that the cubic SOI makes the Rabi frequency non-linear with the applied microwave amplitude. At the same time, the fidelity of the spin manipulations becomes worse since the residual spin-orbital couplings induces spin relaxation.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal pressures from light scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atoms trapped in microscopic optical tweezers have emerged as a growing platform for quantum science. Achieving homogeneity over the tweezers array is an important technical requirement, and our research focuses on improving it for holographic arrays generated with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). We present a series of optimization methods to calculate better holograms, fueled by precise measurement schemes. These innovations enable to achieve intensity homogeneity with a relative standard deviation of 0.3 %, shape variations below 0.5 %, and positioning errors within 70 nm. Such ultra-precise holographic optical tweezers arrays allow for the most demanding applications in quantum science with atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Current Correlations and Conductivity in SYK-Like Systems: An Analytical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a functional-based approach to compute thermal expectation values for actions expressed in the $G-\Sigma$ formalism, applicable to any time sequence ordering. Utilizing this framework, we analyze the linear response to an electric field in various Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) chains. We consider the SYK chain where each dot is a complex $q/2$-body interacting SYK model, and we allow for $r/2$-body nearest-neighbor hopping where $r=\kappa q$. We find exact analytical expressions in the large-$q$ limit for conductivities across all temperatures at leading order in $1/q$ for three cases, namely $\kappa = \{ 1/2, 1, 2\}$. When $\kappa = \{1/2, 1\}$, we observe linear-in-temperature $T$ resistivities at low temperatures, indicative of strange metal behavior. Conversely, when $\kappa = 2$, the resistivity diverges as a power law at low temperatures, namely as $1/T^2$, resembling insulating behavior. As $T$ increases, there is a crossover to Fermi liquid behavior ($\sim T^2$) at the minimum resistivity. Beyond this, another crossover occurs to strange metal behavior ($\sim T$). In comparison to previous linear-in-$T$ results in the literature, we also show that the resistivity behavior exists even below the MIR bound, indicating a true strange metal instead of a bad metal. In particular, we find for the $\kappa = 2$ case a smooth crossover from an insulating phase to a Fermi liquid behavior to a true strange metal and eventually becoming a bad metal as temperature increases. We extend and generalize previously known results on resistivities to all temperatures, do a comparative analysis across the three models where we highlight the universal features and invoke scaling arguments to create a physical picture out of our analyses. Remarkably, we find a universal maximum DC conductivity across all three models when the hopping coupling strength becomes large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new scanning nanomechanical noise microscopy platform enabling to both heat and acquire the fluctuations of mechanical nanostructures with nanometric resolution. We use this platform to image the thermally activated nanomechanical dynamics of a model system consisting of a $40\,\mathrm{nm}$ diameter single-defect nanowire, while scanning a localized heat source across its surface. We develop a thermal backaction model, which we use to demonstrate a close connection between the structure of the nanowire, its thermal response, its dissipation and its fluctuations. We notably show that the defect behaves as a single fluctuation hub, whose e-beam excitation yields a far off-equilibrium vibrational state, largely dominated by the quantum fluctuations of the heating source. Our platform is of interest for future quantitative investigation of fundamental nanoscale dynamical phenomena, and appears as a new playground for investigating quantum thermodynamics in the strongly dissipative regime and at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum One-Class Support Vector Machines for Anomaly Detection Using Randomized Measurements and Variable Subsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum one-class support vector machines leverage the advantage of quantum kernel methods for semi-supervised anomaly detection. However, their quadratic time complexity with respect to data size poses challenges when dealing with large datasets. In recent work, quantum randomized measurements kernels and variable subsampling were proposed, as two independent methods to address this problem. The former achieves higher average precision, but suffers from variance, while the latter achieves linear complexity to data size and has lower variance. The current work focuses instead on combining these two methods, along with rotated feature bagging, to achieve linear time complexity both to data size and to number of features. Despite their instability, the resulting models exhibit considerably higher performance and faster training and testing times.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While several researchers report counterexamples of the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase is robust against the stacking if it has an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a one-dimensional class DIII superconductor with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology to the corresponding non-Hermitian system in AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

Abstract: Band structures of metamaterials described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem are beyond the existing topological band theory. In this paper, we analyze non-Hermitian topology under the nonlinearity of eigenvalues. Specifically, we elucidate that such nonlinear systems may exhibit exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects which are unique non-Hermitian topological phenomena. The robustness of these non-Hermitian phenomena is clarified by introducing the topological invariants under nonlinearity which reproduce the existing ones in linear systems. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates that exceptional points may emerge even for systems without an internal degree of freedom where the equation is single component. These nonlinearity-induced exceptional points are observed in mechanical metamaterials, e.g., the Kapitza pendulum.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</description>

      <title>Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment: a Scalable Quantum-Safe Key Distribution Protocol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-shared keys (PSK) have been widely used in network security. Nonetheless, existing PSK solutions are not scalable. Moreover, whenever a new user joins a network, PSK requires an existing user to get a new key before they are able to communicate with the new user. The key issue is how to distribute the PSK between different users. Here, we solve this problem by proposing a new protocol called Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE). DSKE has the advantage of being scalable. Unlike standard public key infrastructure (PKI) which relies on computational assumptions, DSKE provides information-theoretic security in a universally composable security framework. Specifically, we prove the security (correctness and confidentiality) and robustness of this protocol against a computationally unbounded adversary, who additionally may have fully compromised a bounded number of the intermediaries and can eavesdrop on all communication. DSKE also achieves distributed trust through secret sharing.
  We present several implementations of DSKE in real environments, such as providing client services to link encryptors, network encryptors, and mobile phones, as well as the implementation of intermediaries, called Security Hubs, and associated test data as evidence for its versatility. As DSKE is highly scalable in a network setting with no distance limit, it is expected to be a cost-effective quantum-safe cryptographic solution to the network security threat presented by quantum computers.</description>

      <title>2D Skyrmion topological charge of spin textures with arbitrary boundary conditions: a two-component spinorial BEC as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the most general expression for the Skyrmion topological charge for a two-dimensional spin texture, valid for any type of boundary conditions or for any arbitrary spatial region within the texture. It reduces to the usual one $Q = 1/4\pi \iint \vec f \cdot \left(\partial_x \vec f \times \partial_y \vec f\right)$ for the appropriate boundary conditions, with $\vec f$ the spin texture. The general expression resembles the Gauss-Bonet theorem for the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of a 2D surface, but it has definite differences, responsible for the assignment of the proper signs of the Skyrmion charges. Additionally, we show that the charge of a single Skyrmion is the product of the value of the normal component of the spin texture at the singularity times the Index or winding number of the transverse texture, a generalization of a Poincar\'e theorem. We illustrate our general results analyzing in detail a two-component spinor Bose-Einstein condensate in 2D in the presence of an external magnetic field, via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The condensate spin textures present Skyrmions singularities at the spatial locations where the transverse magnetic field vanishes. We show that the ensuing superfluid vortices and Skyrmions have the same value for their corresponding topological charges, in turn due to the structure of the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol for a scalable, cost-effective, information-theoretically secure key distribution and management system. The system, called Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE), relies on pre-shared random numbers between DSKE clients and a group of Security Hubs. Any group of DSKE clients can use the DSKE protocol to distill from the pre-shared numbers a secret key. The clients are protected from Security Hub compromise via a secret sharing scheme that allows the creation of the final key without the need to trust individual Security Hubs. Precisely, if the number of compromised Security Hubs does not exceed a certain threshold, confidentiality is guaranteed to DSKE clients and, at the same time, robustness against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The DSKE system can be used for quantum-secure communication, can be easily integrated into existing network infrastructures, and can support arbitrary groups of communication parties that have access to a key. We discuss the high-level protocol, analyze its security, including its robustness against disruption. A proof-of-principle demonstration of secure communication between two distant clients with a DSKE-based VPN using Security Hubs on Amazon Web Server (AWS) nodes thousands of kilometres away from them was performed, demonstrating the feasibility of DSKE-enabled secret sharing one-time-pad encryption with a data rate above 50 Mbit/s and a latency below 70 ms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise quantum control and measurement of several harmonic oscillators, such as the modes of the electromagnetic field in a cavity or of mechanical motion, are key for their use as quantum platforms. The motional modes of trapped ions can be individually controlled and have good coherence properties. However, achieving high-fidelity two-mode operations and nondestructive measurements of the motional state has been challenging. Here we demonstrate the coherent exchange of single motional quanta between spectrally separated harmonic motional modes of a trapped-ion crystal. The timing, strength, and phase of the coupling are controlled through an oscillating electric potential with suitable spatial variation. Coupling rates that are much larger than decoherence rates enable demonstrations of high fidelity quantum state transfer and beamsplitter operations, entanglement of motional modes, and Hong-Ou-Mandel-type interference. Additionally, we use the motional coupling to enable repeated non-destructive projective measurement of a trapped-ion motional state. Our work enhances the suitability of trapped-ion motion for continuous-variable quantum computing and error correction and may provide opportunities to improve the performance of motional cooling and motion-mediated entangling interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple model of composite particle tunnelling through a rectangular potential barrier in presence of magnetic field. The exact numerical solution of the problem is provided and the applicability to real physical situations is discussed. Some qualitative features of tunnelling with no magnetic interaction are retained, but some new ones are also observed. The resonance peaks in transmission spectrum generally do not reach $100\%$ transmission probability when the magnetic field is turned on. We observe splitting and in some cases widening of transmission probability peaks. When the width $b$ of area with magnetic field is large, we observe oscillations of spin-flip probability with energy and $b$ which are caused by Larmor precession of spin about the vector of magnetic field. For some values of relevant parameters we also observe significant increase of tunnelling probability for low energies in the single particle case.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-Based Entanglement Witnesses for Non-Gaussian States of Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of entanglement witnesses for continuous variable systems, which rely on the sole assumption that their dynamics is that of coupled harmonic oscillators at the time of the test. Entanglement is inferred from the Tsirelson nonclassicality test on one of the normal modes, without any knowledge about the state of the other mode. In each round, the protocol requires measuring only the sign of one coordinate (e.g., position) at one among several times. This dynamic-based entanglement witness is more akin to a Bell inequality than to an uncertainty relation: in particular, it does not admit false positives from classical theory. Our criterion detects non-Gaussian states, some of which are missed by other criteria.</description>

Abstract: We consider process tomography for unitary quantum channels. Given access to an unknown unitary channel acting on a $\textsf{d}$-dimensional qudit, we aim to output a classical description of a unitary that is $\varepsilon$-close to the unknown unitary in diamond norm. We design an algorithm achieving error $\varepsilon$ using $O(\textsf{d}^2/\varepsilon)$ applications of the unknown channel and only one qudit. This improves over prior results, which use $O(\textsf{d}^3/\varepsilon^2)$ [via standard process tomography] or $O(\textsf{d}^{2.5}/\varepsilon)$ [Yang, Renner, and Chiribella, PRL 2020] applications. To show this result, we introduce a simple technique to "bootstrap" an algorithm that can produce constant-error estimates to one that can produce $\varepsilon$-error estimates with the Heisenberg scaling. Finally, we prove a complementary lower bound showing that estimation requires $\Omega(\textsf{d}^2/\varepsilon)$ applications, even with access to the inverse or controlled versions of the unknown unitary. This shows that our algorithm has both optimal query complexity and optimal space complexity.</description>

Abstract: The characterization of continuous-variable quantum states is crucial for applications in quantum communication, sensing, simulation and computing. However, a full characterization of multimode quantum states requires a number of experiments that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Here we propose an alternative approach where the goal is not to reconstruct the full quantum state, but rather to estimate its characteristic function at a given set of points. For multimode states with reflection symmetry, we show that the characteristic function at M points can be estimated using only O(log M ) copies of the state, independently of the number of modes. When the characteristic function is known to be positive, as in the case of squeezed vacuum states, the estimation is achieved by an experimentally friendly setup using only beamsplitters and homodyne measurements.</description>

      <title>Relations between quantum metrology and criticality in general su(1, 1) systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a prevalent effort to achieve quantum-enhanced metrology using criticality. However, the extent to which estimation precision is enhanced through criticality still needs further exploration under the constraint of finite time resources. We clarify relations between quantum metrology and criticality through a unitary parametrization process with a Hamiltonian governed by su(1, 1) Lie algebra. We demonstrate that the determination of the generator in the parameterization can be treated as an extended brachistochrone problem. Furthermore, the dynamic quantum Fisher information about the parameter exhibits a power-law dependence on the evolution time as the system approaches its critical point. By investigating the dynamic sensing proposals of three quantum critical systems, we show that the asymptotic behavior of sensitivity is consistent with our predictions. Our theory provides a deep understanding on the interplay of quantum metrology and criticality, providing insights into the underlying connections that involve both quantum phenomena and classical problems.</description>

      <title>Towards the coherent control of robust spin qubits in quantum algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many efforts have succeeded over the last decade at lengthening the timescale in which spin qubits loss quantum information under free evolution. With these design principles at a mature stage, it is now timely to widen the scope and take the whole picture: concerning applications that require user-driven coherent evolutions, qubits should be assessed operating within the desired algorithm. This means to test qubits under external control while relaxation and imperfections are active, and to maximize the algorithm fidelity as the actual figure of merit. Herein, we pose and analytically solve a master equation devised to run one-spin-qubit gate-based algorithms subject to relaxation. It is handled via a home-made code, QBithm, which inputs gate sequences and relaxation rates thus connecting with the longstanding work devoted to their $\textit{ab initio}$ computation. We evaluate the impact of relaxation and potential experimental imperfections in the calculated fidelities, and implement well-known pulse sequences quantitatively agreeing with experimental data. Hopefully, this work will stimulate the study of many-spin-qubit systems in quantum algorithms, and will serve as a help to design robust spin qubits against decoherence and to perform better-characterized experiments.</description>

      <title>All-photonic GKP-qubit repeater using analog-information-assisted multiplexed entanglement ranking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long distance quantum communication will require the use of quantum repeaters to overcome the exponential attenuation of signal with distance. One class of such repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the communication channel. Here we propose a novel strategy of using the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with multiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13 dB of GKP squeezing. We also quantify the number of GKP qubits needed for the implementation of our scheme and find that for good hardware parameters our scheme requires around $10^3-10^4$ GKP qubits per repeater per protocol run.</description>

      <title>Scalable Determination of Multipartite Entanglement in Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks comprised of entangled end nodes serve stronger than the classical correlation for unparalleled quantum internet applications. However, practical quantum networking is affected by noise, which at its worst, causes end nodes to be described by pre-existing classical data. In such untrusted networks, determining quantum network fidelity and genuine multi-node entanglement becomes crucial. Here, we show that determining quantum network fidelity and genuine $N$-node entanglement in an untrusted star network requires only $N+1$ measurement settings. This method establishes a semi-trusted framework, allowing some nodes to relax their assumptions. Our network determination method is enabled by detecting genuine $N$-node Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability. Experimentally, using spontaneous parametric down-conversion entanglement sources, we demonstrate the determinations of genuine 3-photon and 4-photon quantum networks and the false positives of the widely used entanglement witness, the fidelity criterion of $1/2$. Our results provide a scalable method for the determination of multipartite entanglement in realistic quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: We present techniques for performing two-qubit gates on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes with finite energy, and find that operations designed for ideal infinite-energy codes create undesired entanglement when applied to physically realistic states. We demonstrate that this can be mitigated using recently developed local error-correction protocols, and evaluate the resulting performance. We also propose energy-conserving finite-energy gate implementations which largely avoid the need for further correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spins associated to optically accessible solid-state defects have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring quantum simulation, quantum sensing and quantum communication. Pioneering experiments have shown the sensing, imaging, and control of multiple nuclear spins surrounding a single electron-spin defect. However, the accessible size of these spin networks has been constrained by the spectral resolution of current methods. Here, we map a network of 50 coupled spins through high-resolution correlated sensing schemes, using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We develop concatenated double-resonance sequences that identify spin-chains through the network. These chains reveal the characteristic spin frequencies and their interconnections with high spectral resolution, and can be fused together to map out the network. Our results provide new opportunities for quantum simulations by increasing the number of available spin qubits. Additionally, our methods might find applications in nano-scale imaging of complex spin systems external to the host crystal.</description>

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are emerging as key elements in the quest for quantum-based technologies and in the study of fundamental physics. In this study, we address the challenge of achieving fast and high-fidelity evolutions across quantum phase transitions, a crucial requirement for practical applications. We introduce a control technique based on dynamical invariants tailored to ensure adiabatic-like evolution within the lowest-energy subspace of the many-body systems described by the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. By tuning the controllable parameter according to analytical control results, we achieve high-fidelity evolutions operating close to the speed limit. Remarkably, our approach leads to the breakdown of Kibble-Zurek scaling laws, offering tunable and significantly improved time scaling behavior. We provide detailed numerical simulations to illustrate our findings, demonstrating scalability with the system size and robustness against noisy controls and disorder, as well as its applicability to a non-integrable system.</description>

Abstract: This work discusses the possibility of using two-mode squeezed light to improve the performance of existing sensor technology with the focus on its miniaturization under realistic losses. Therefore, we analyze a system consisting of a part for the two-mode squeezed light generation, a sensor region and a detection stage. Based on a general four-wave mixing (FWM) Hamiltonian caused by the third order susceptibility, we formulate linearized equations that describe the FWM process below the threshold and are used to analyze the squeezing quality between the generated optical signal and idler modes. For a possible realization, the focus is set on the chip-integrated generation using micro-ring resonators. To do so, the impact of the design and the pump light are considered in the derived equations. These equations are used to analyze the usage of two-mode squeezed light in quantum metrology and the application in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Due to the impact of losses in realistic use cases, we show that the main usage is for small and compact devices, which can lead to a quantum improvement up to a factor of ten in comparison of using coherent light only. This enables the use of small squeezing-enhanced sensors with a performance comparable to larger classical sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining whether a subspace spanned by certain quantum states is entangled and its entanglement dimensionality remains a fundamental challenge in quantum information science. This paper introduces a geometric measure of $r$-bounded rank, $E_r(\mathcal{S})$, for a given subspace $\mathcal{S}$. Derived from the established geometric measure of entanglement, this measure is specifically designed to assess the entanglement within $\mathcal{S}$. It not only serves as a tool for determining the entanglement dimensionality but also illuminates the subspace's capacity to preserve such entanglement. By employing developed non-convex optimization techniques utilized in machine learning area, we can accurately calculate $E_r(\mathcal{S})$ within the manifold optimization framework. Our approach demonstrates notable advantages over existing hierarchical methods, PPT relaxation techniques, and the seesaw strategy, particularly by combining computational efficiency with broad applicability. More importantly, it paves the way for high-dimensional entanglement certification, which is crucial for numerous quantum information tasks. We showcase its effectiveness in validating high-dimensional entangled subspaces in bipartite systems, determining the border rank of multipartite pure states, and identifying genuinely or completely entangled subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum computing, the nonstabilizerness of quantum operations is crucial for understanding and quantifying quantum speedups. In this study, we explore the phenomena of nonstabilizerness of the quantum SWITCH, a novel structure that allows quantum states to pass through operations in a superposition of different orders, outperforming traditional circuits in numerous tasks. To assess its nonstabilizerness, we propose the magic resource capacity of a quantum process to quantitatively examine the nonstabilizerness of general quantum transformations. We find that the completely stabilizer-preserving operations, which cannot generate magic states under standard conditions, can be transformed to do so when processed by the quantum SWITCH. Furthermore, when considering the impact of noise, although the nonstabilizerness of each path may be annihilated, their superposition could still preserve the overall nonstabilizerness. These findings reveal the unique properties of the quantum SWITCH and open avenues in research on nonstabilizer resources of general quantum architecture.</description>

Abstract: Delay lines that store quantum information are crucial for advancing quantum repeaters and hardware efficient quantum computers. Traditionally, they are realized as extended systems that support wave propagation but provide limited control over the propagating fields. Here, we introduce a parametrically addressed delay line for microwave photons that provides a high level of control over the stored pulses. By parametrically driving a three-wave mixing circuit element that is weakly hybridized with an ensemble of resonators, we engineer a spectral response that simulates that of a physical delay line, while providing fast control over the delay line's properties. We demonstrate this novel degree of control by choosing which photon echo to emit, translating pulses in time, and even swapping two pulses, all with pulse energies on the order of a single photon. We also measure the noise added from our parametric interactions and find it is much less than one photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a system. Estimating the entropy of a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ and R\'enyi entropy $S_\alpha(\rho)$ of an $N$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$, given access to independent samples of $\rho$. Specifically, we provide the following:
  1. A quantum estimator for $S(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016).
  2. A quantum estimator for $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^{4/\alpha-2})$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tilde O(N^{4-2/\alpha})$ for $\alpha&gt;1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^{6/\alpha})$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\alpha&gt;1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity.
  Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_{\alpha}(\rho)$.
  Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\tilde\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $\rho$. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Maximally entangled mixed states for a fixed spectrum do not always exist</title>

Abstract: Entanglement is a resource under local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC). Given a set of states $S$, if there is one state in $S$ that can be transformed by LOCC into all other states in $S$, then this state is maximally entangled in $S$. It is a well-known result that the $d$-dimensional Bell state is the maximally entangled state in the set of all bipartite states of local dimension $d$. Since in practical applications noise renders every state mixed, it is interesting to study whether sets of mixed states of relevance enable the notion of a maximally entangled state. A natural choice is the set of all states with the same spectrum. In fact, for any given spectrum distribution on two-qubit states, previous work has shown that several entanglement measures are all maximized by one particular state in this set. This has led to consider the possibility that this family of states could be the maximally entangled states in the set of all states with the same spectrum, which should then maximize all entanglement measures. In this work I answer this question in the negative: there are no maximally entangled states for a fixed spectrum in general, i.e. for every possible choice of the spectrum. In order to do so, I consider the case of rank-2 states and show that for particular values of the eigenvalues there exists no state that can be transformed to all other isospectral states not only under LOCC but also under the larger class of non-entangling operations. This in particular implies that in these cases the state that maximizes a given entanglement measure among all states with the same spectrum depends on the choice of entanglement measure, i.e. it cannot be that the aforementioned family of states maximizes all entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>The role of polaron dressing in superradiant emission dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative effects of multiple quantum emitters are characterized by transitions via delocalized collective states with altered emission properties due to the existence of inter-emitter coherences. When realized with excitonic condensed matter nanostructures, these effects are significantly affected by the presence of strong emitter-phonon coupling, which leads to the formation of polarons. We show that, while for single-emitter emission into free space this formation has no impact on its radiative lifetime, the same is not true for superradiant emission. Considering the case of two indistinguishable quantum emitters, we analyse how polaron dressing affects collective photon emission by mixing bright and dark Dicke states. Our numerical simulations show that this mixing crucially depends on the circumstances of the excitation of the system: Depending on the pulse length of an exciting laser, one can choose to either prepare polaronic Dicke states, or bare electronic Dicke states, changing the superradiant decay characteristics of the system. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for these limiting cases, which match the results of numerically exact calculations.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Lower Bounds of Wigner Negativity Volume and Non-Gaussian Entanglement with Conditional Displacement Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In circuit and cavity quantum electrodynamics devices where control qubits are dispersively coupled to high-quality-factor cavities, characteristic functions of cavity states can be directly probed with conditional displacement (CD) gates. In this Letter, I propose a method to certify non-Gaussian entanglement between cavities using only CD gates and qubit readouts. The CD witness arises from an application of Bochner's theorem to a surprising connection between two negativities: that of the reduced Wigner function, and that of the partial transpose. Non-Gaussian entanglement of some common states, like entangled cats and photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacua, can be detected by measuring as few as four points of the characteristic function. Furthermore, the expectation value of the witness is a simultaneous lower bound to the Wigner negativity volume and a geometric measure of entanglement conjectured to be the partial transpose negativity. Both negativities are strong monotones of non-Gaussianity and entanglement, respectively, so the CD witness provides experimentally accessible lower bounds to quantities related to these monotones without the need for tomography on the cavity states.</description>

Abstract: Simulation-based optimization is a widely used method to solve stochastic optimization problems. This method aims to identify an optimal solution by maximizing the expected value of the objective function. However, due to its computational complexity, the function cannot be accurately evaluated directly, hence it is estimated through simulation. Exploiting the enhanced efficiency of Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, it frequently outpaces classical simulation-based optimization, resulting in notable performance enhancements in various scenarios. In this work, we make use of a quantum-enhanced algorithm for simulation-based optimization and apply it to solve a variant of the classical Newsvendor problem which is known to be NP-hard. Such problems provide the building block for supply chain management, particularly in inventory management and procurement optimization under risks and uncertainty</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a minimal Goldbach partition with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>

Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p$ and $p'$, with $p \, , p'$ referred to as a Goldbach pair. In this article we present a quantum analogue protocol for detecting -- given a even number $N$ -- the existence of a so-called minimal Goldbach partition $N=p+p'$ with $p\equiv p_{\rm min}(N)$ being the so-called minimal Goldbach prime, i.e. the least possible value for $p$ among all the Goldbach pairs of $N$. The proposed protocol is effectively a quantum Grover algorithm with a modified final stage. Assuming that an approximate smooth upper bound $\mathcal{N}(N)$ for the number of primes less than or equal to $ p_{\rm min}(N)$ is known, our protocol will identify if the set of $\mathcal{N}(N)$ lowest primes contains the minimal Goldbach prime in approximately $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N)}$ steps, against the corresponding classical value $\mathcal{N}(N)$. In the larger context of a search for violations of Goldbach's conjecture, the quantum advantage provided by our scheme appears to be potentially convenient. E.g., referring to the current state-of-art numerical search for violations of the Goldbach conjecture among all even numbers up to $N_{\text{max}} = 4\times 10^{18}$ [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation 83, 2033 (2013)], a quantum realization of the search would deliver a quantum advantage factor of $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}})} \approx 37$ and it will require a Hilbert space spanning $\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}}) \approx 1376$ basis states.</description>

      <title>Two prover perfect zero knowledge for MIP*</title>

Abstract: The recent MIP*=RE theorem of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen shows that the complexity class MIP* of multiprover proof systems with entangled provers contains all recursively enumerable languages. Prior work of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a technique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect zero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*?
  In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint systems, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction due to Dwork, Feige, Kilian, Naor, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a classical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator strategies, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting operator BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol.</description>

Abstract: Analog Quantum Computers are promising tools for improving performance on applications such as modeling behavior of quantum materials, providing fast heuristic solutions to optimization problems, and simulating quantum systems. Due to the challenges of simulating dynamic quantum systems, there are relatively few classical tools for modeling the behavior of these devices and verifying their performance. QuantumAnnealing.jl provides a toolkit for performing simulations of Analog Quantum Computers on classical hardware. This package includes functionality for simulation of the time evolution of the Transverse Field Ising Model, replicating annealing schedules used by real world annealing hardware, implementing custom annealing schedules, and more. This allows for rapid prototyping of models expected to display interesting behavior, verification of the performance of quantum devices, and easy comparison against the expected behavior of quantum devices against classical approaches for small systems. The software is provided as open-source and is available through Julia's package registry system.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are a common challenge in business, requiring finding optimal solutions under specified constraints. While significant progress has been made with variational approaches such as QAOA, most problems addressed are unconstrained (such as Max-Cut). In this study, we investigate a hybrid quantum-classical method for constrained optimization problems, particularly those with knapsack constraints that occur frequently in financial and supply chain applications. Our proposed method relies firstly on relaxations to local quantum Hamiltonians, defined through commutative maps. Drawing inspiration from quantum random access code (QRAC) concepts, particularly Quantum Random Access Optimizer (QRAO), we explore QRAO's potential in solving large constrained optimization problems. We employ classical techniques like Linear Relaxation as a presolve mechanism to handle constraints and cope further with scalability. We compare our approach with QAOA and present the final results for a real-world procurement optimization problem: a significant sized multi-knapsack-constrained problem.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for providing unbiased estimators of multiple observables with low statistical error by utilizing informationally (over)complete measurements and tensor networks. The technique consists of an observable-specific classical optimization of the measurement data based on tensor networks leading to low-variance estimations. Compared to other observable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement frames, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimized to provide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to achieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of qubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any measurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient representation in terms of tensor networks. We benchmark the method through various numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems in both infinite and finite statistics scenarios, and show how optimal estimation can be found even when we use tensor networks with low bond dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is crucial to the occurrence of phase transitions. Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents degenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After crossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum superposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the fundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such quantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in many-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB process in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between the individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an all-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The observed nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking region go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on phase transitions for quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>

Abstract: IBM quantum computers are used to simulate the dynamics of small systems of interacting quantum spins. For time-independent systems with fewer than three spins, we compute the exact time evolution at arbitrary times and measure spin expectation values and energy. It is demonstrated that even in such small systems, one can observe the connection between conservation laws and symmetries in the model. Larger systems require approximating the time-evolution operator, and we investigate the case of $N=3$ spins explicitly. While it is shown to be unfeasible to use such devices to probe such larger systems without more advanced algorithms or reliable error correction, we demonstrate that the quantum circuit simulator is an easy-to-use method for studying spin dynamics in systems with $N\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$) spins. The computations presented provide an interesting experimental component to the standard treatment of quantum spin in an undergraduate quantum mechanics course.</description>

Abstract: Disentangled black hole microstates are atypical states in holographic CFTs whose gravity duals do not have smooth horizons. If there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for the entire black hole entropy, then any black hole microstate can be written as a superposition of states without smooth horizons. We show that there exist sufficiently many disentangled microstates to account for almost the entire black hole entropy of a large AdS black hole at the semiclassical limit $G_N\rightarrow 0$. In addition, we also argue that in generic quantum many-body systems with short-ranged interactions, there exist sufficiently many area law states in the microcanonical subspace to account for almost the entire thermodynamic entropy in the standard thermodynamic limit. Area law states are atypical since a typical state should contain volume law entanglement. Furthermore, we also present an explicit way to construct such a set of area law states, and argue that the same construction may also be used to construct disentangled states.</description>

Abstract: The Distributed Symmetric Key Establishment (DSKE) protocol provides secure secret exchange (e.g., for key exchange) between two honest parties that need not have had prior contact, and use intermediaries with whom they each securely share confidential data. We show the composable security of the DSKE protocol in the constructive cryptography framework of Maurer. Specifically, we prove the security (correctness and confidentiality) and robustness of this protocol against any computationally unbounded adversary, who additionally may have fully compromised a bounded number of the intermediaries and can eavesdrop on all communication. As DSKE is highly scalable in a network setting with no distance limit, it is expected to be a cost-effective quantum-safe cryptographic solution to safeguarding the network security against the threat of quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the computational efficiency of the finite temperature simulation with the minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). To argue that METTS can be efficiently represented as matrix product states, we present an analytic upper bound for the average entanglement Renyi entropy of METTS for Renyi index $0&lt;q\leq 1$. In particular, for 1D gapless systems described by CFTs, the upper bound scales as $\mathcal{O}(c N^0 \log \beta)$ where $c$ is the central charge and $N$ is the system size. Furthermore, we numerically find that the average Renyi entropy exhibits a universal behavior characterized by the central charge and is roughly given by half of the analytic upper bound. Based on these results, we show that METTS provide a significant speedup compared to employing the purification method to analyze thermal equilibrium states at low temperatures in 1D gapless systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement in Dark Matter Detection with Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to significantly enhance the signal rate in qubit-based dark matter detection experiments with the help of quantum interference. Various quantum sensors possess ideal properties for detecting wave-like dark matter, and qubits, commonly employed in quantum computers, are excellent candidates for dark matter detectors. We demonstrate that, by designing an appropriate quantum circuit to manipulate the qubits, the signal rate scales proportionally to $n_{\rm q}^2$, with $n_{\rm q}$ being the number of sensor qubits, rather than linearly with $n_{\rm q}$. Consequently, in the dark matter detection with a substantial number of sensor qubits, a significant increase in the signal rate can be expected. We provide a specific example of a quantum circuit that achieves this enhancement by coherently combining the phase evolution in each individual qubit due to its interaction with dark matter. We also demonstrate that the circuit is fault tolerant to de-phasing noises, a critical quantum noise source in quantum computers. The enhancement mechanism proposed here is applicable to various modalities for quantum computers, provided that the quantum operations relevant to enhancing the dark matter signal can be applied to these devices.</description>

      <title>Hyperpolyadic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01366v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of division algebras, the hyperpolyadic algebras, which correspond to the binary division algebras $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$ without considering new elements. First, we use the matrix polyadization procedure proposed earlier which increases the dimension of the algebra. The algebras obtained in this way obey binary addition and a nonderived n-ary multiplication and their subalgebras are division n-ary algebras. For each invertible element we define a new norm which is polyadically multiplicative, and the corresponding map is a $n$-ary homomorphism. We define a polyadic analog of the Cayley-Dickson construction which corresponds to the consequent embedding of monomial matrices from the polyadization procedure. We then obtain another series of n-ary algebras corresponding to the binary division algebras which have a higher dimension, that is proportional to the intermediate arities. Second, a new polyadic product of vectors in any vector space is defined. Endowed with this product the vector space becomes a polyadic algebra which is a division algebra under some invertibility conditions, and its structure constants are computed. Third, we propose a new iterative process ("imaginary tower"), which leads to nonunital nonderived ternary division algebras of half the dimension, which we call "half-quaternions" and "half-octonions". The latter are not subalgebras of the binary division algebras, but subsets only, since they have different arity. Nevertheless, they are actually ternary division algebras, because they allow division, and their nonzero elements are invertible. From the multiplicativity of the introduced "half-quaternion" norm we obtain the ternary analog of the sum of two squares identity. We show that the ternary division algebra of imaginary "half-octonions" is unitless and totally associative.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario.</description>

      <title>A warm Rydberg atom-based quadrature amplitude-modulated receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms exhibit remarkable sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, making them promising candidates for revolutionizing field sensors. Unlike conventional antennas, they neither disturb the measured field nor necessitate intricate calibration procedures. In this study, we propose a protocol for signal reception near the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band, harnessing the capabilities of warm Rydberg atoms. Our focus lies on exploring various quadrature amplitude modulations and transmission frequencies through heterodyne detection. We offer a comprehensive characterization of our setup, encompassing the atomic response frequency range and attainable electric field amplitudes. Additionally, we delve into analyzing communication errors using Voronoi diagrams, along with evaluating the communication channel capacity across different modulation schemes. Our findings not only lay the groundwork for future wireless communication applications, but also present opportunities to refine protocols in classical communication and field sensing domains.</description>

Abstract: The need to determine scattering amplitudes of few-hadron systems for arbitrary kinematics expands a broad set of subfields of modern-day nuclear and hadronic physics. In this work, we expand upon previous explorations on the use of real-time methods, like quantum computing or tensor networks, to determine few-body scattering amplitudes. Such calculations must be performed in a finite Minkowski spacetime, where scattering amplitudes are not well defined. Our previous work presented a conjecture of a systematically improvable estimator for scattering amplitudes constructed from finite-volume correlation functions. Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current models of ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas are often considered as compatible with quantum theory. In this work, however, it is shown that improvements should be introduced into these models to take into account the quantum nature of phase space related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. Hamiltonian operator of a gas particle and its eigenstates are firstly determined and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamics properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particles number, the internal energy and the pressure as well as the state equations, corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperature and for confined volume. They permit in particular to highlight the existence of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamics functions and variables are directly related to the momenta quantum statistical variances. Well-known relations corresponding to classic al ideal gas model can be retrieved from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperature and for large volume.</description>

      <title>Thermal Pure States for Systems with Antiunitary Symmetries and Their Tensor Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal pure state algorithms, which employ pure quantum states representing thermal equilibrium states instead of statistical ensembles, are useful both for numerical simulations and for theoretical analysis of thermal states. However, their inherently large entanglement makes it difficult to represent efficiently and limits their use in analyzing large systems. Here, we propose a new algorithm for constructing thermal pure states for systems with certain antiunitary symmetries, such as time-reversal or complex conjugation symmetry. Our method utilizes thermal pure states that, while exhibiting volume-law entanglement, can be mapped to tensor network states through simple transformations. Furthermore, our approach does not rely on random sampling and thus avoids statistical uncertainty. Moreover, we can compute not only thermal expectation values of local observables but also thermodynamic functions. We demonstrate the validity and utility of our method by applying it to the one-dimensional XY model and the two-dimensional Ising model on a triangular lattice. Our results suggest a new class of variational wave functions for volume-law states that are not limited to thermal equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>QEEGNet: Quantum Machine Learning for Enhanced Electroencephalography Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool in neuroscience and clinical practice for monitoring and analyzing brain activity. Traditional neural network models, such as EEGNet, have achieved considerable success in decoding EEG signals but often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in quantum computing present new opportunities to enhance machine learning models through quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a novel hybrid neural network that integrates quantum computing with the classical EEGNet architecture to improve EEG encoding and analysis, as a forward-looking approach, acknowledging that the results might not always surpass traditional methods but it shows its potential. QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise. Our results highlight the significant potential of quantum-enhanced neural networks in EEG analysis, suggesting new directions for both research and practical applications in the field.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients $-$ Towards High Throughput Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>
