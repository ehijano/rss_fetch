      <title>Symbolic construction of the chemical Jacobian of quasi-steady state (QSS) chemistries for Exascale computing platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) can be an effective tool for reducing the size and stiffness of chemical mechanisms for implementation in computational reacting flow solvers. However, for many applications, stiffness remains, and the resulting model requires implicit methods for efficient time integration. In this paper, we outline an approach to formulating the QSSA reduction that is coupled with a strategy to generate C++ source code to evaluate the net species production rate, and the chemical Jacobian. The code-generation component employs a symbolic approach enabling a simple and effective strategy to analytically compute the chemical Jacobian. For computational tractability, the symbolic approach needs to be paired with common subexpression elimination which can negatively affect memory usage. Several solutions are outlined and successfully tested on a 3D multipulse ignition problem, thus allowing portable application across a chemical model sizes and GPU capabilities. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics under an open-source license.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Bootstrap: Using Transformers to Compute Scattering Amplitudes in Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (&gt; 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Computation of Inter-Core Bounds Through Exact Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time systems (RTSs) are at the heart of numerous safety-critical applications. An RTS typically consists of a set of real-time tasks (the software) that execute on a multicore shared-memory platform (the hardware) following a scheduling policy. In an RTS, computing inter-core bounds, i.e., bounds separating events produced by tasks on different cores, is crucial. While efficient techniques to over-approximate such bounds exist, little has been proposed to compute their exact values. Given an RTS with a set of cores C and a set of tasks T , under partitioned fixed- priority scheduling with limited preemption, a recent work by Foughali, Hladik and Zuepke (FHZ) models tasks with affinity c (i.e., allocated to core c in C) as a Uppaal timed automata (TA) network Nc. For each core c in C, Nc integrates blocking (due to data sharing) using tight analytical formulae. Through compositional model checking, FHZ achieved a substantial gain in scalability for bounds local to a core. However, computing inter-core bounds for some events of interest E, produced by a subset of tasks TE with different affinities CE, requires model checking the parallel composition of all TA networks Nc for each c in CE, which produces a large, often intractable, state space. In this paper, we present a new scalable approach based on exact abstractions to compute exact inter-core bounds in a schedulable RTS, under the assumption that tasks in TE have distinct affinities. We develop a novel algorithm, leveraging a new query that we implement in Uppaal, that computes for each TA network Nc in NE an abstraction A(Nc) preserving the exact intervals within which events occur on c, therefore drastically reducing the state space. The scalability of our approach is demonstrated on the WATERS 2017 industrial challenge, for which we efficiently compute various types of inter-core bounds where FHZ fails to scale.</description>

      <title>Unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Description Logics are a formalism used in the knowledge representation, where the knowledge is captured in the form of concepts constructed in a controlled way from a restricted vocabulary. This allows one to test effectively for consistency of and the subsumption between the concepts. Unification of concepts may likewise become a useful tool in analysing the relations between concepts. The unification problem has been solved for the description logics $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. These small logics do not provide any means to express negation. Here we show an algorithm solving unification in $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$, the logic that extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom concept. Bottom allows one to express that two concepts are disjoint. Our algorithm runs in exponential time, with respect to the size of the problem.</description>

      <title>Conditions for eigenvalue configurations of two real symmetric matrices: a symmetric function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two real symmetric matrices, their eigenvalue configuration is the arrangement of their eigenvalues on the real line. We study the problem of determining a quantifier-free necessary and sufficient condition for two real symmetric matrices to realize a given eigenvalue configuration as a generalization of Descartes' rule of signs. We exploit the combinatorial properties of our definition for eigenvalue configuration to reduce a two-polynomial root counting problem into several single-polynomial root counting problems of symmetric polynomials. We then leverage the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials to derive a final quantifier-free necessary and sufficient condition for two real symmetric matrices to realize a given eigenvalue configuration.</description>

      <title>Conditions for eigenvalue configurations of two real symmetric matrices: a signature approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two real symmetric matrices, their eigenvalue configuration is the arrangement of their eigenvalues on the real line. In this paper, we provide quantifier-free necessary and sufficient conditions for two symmetric matrices to realize a given eigenvalue configuration. The basic idea is to generate a set of polynomials in the entries of the two matrices whose roots can be counted to uniquely determine the eigenvalue configuration. This result can be seen as ageneralization of Descartes' rule of signs to the case of two real univariate polynomials.</description>
