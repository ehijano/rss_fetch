      <title>Exploring Weak Turbulence of Phonon and Magnon Beams in Magneto-Acoustic Ultrathin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simple theoretical model describing narrow envelope surface acoustic waves
  (phonons) and spin waves (magnons) in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the general
  principles of weak wave turbulence, the model considers interactions between beams of an ideal
  phonon gas and a weakly non-ideal magnon gas, which represent magnetoacoustic oscillations in
  the system. Equations for the wave envelopes of phonons and magnons, along with their harmonics,
  are derived, incorporating nonlinear effects from three- and four-particle interactions. In
  the general non-resonant case, linear stationary envelope simulations are sufficient. These clarify
  the experimentally observed angular dependence of the transmitted acoustic signal with respect
  to the orientation of the magnetic field. The study highlights increased energy losses associated
  with enhanced magnetoacoustic coupling. Given the broad interdisciplinary interest in weak turbulence
  phenomena within condensed matter physics and nonlinear wave dynamics, our model
  offers significant predictive capabilities and greatly simplifies calculations of quasiparticle beam
  interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermal and quantum phase transitions in a holographic anisotropic Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we build a phenomenological, strongly
  coupled quantum field theory in $2+1$-dimensions through AdS/CFT holography,
  by building a $3+1$-dimensional, negatively curved gravity theory with a $SU(2)$ gauge field,
  and a scalar field in the adjoint of $SU(2)$. We locate a phase transition between two distinct phases at zero and finite temperature, which
  are characterized through the dispersion relation of quasi-normal modes of probe fermions in the bulk,
  and correspond either to a Dirac semimetal or a band insulator. These phases are separated by a
  critical phase/critical point (depending if $T&gt;0$ or $T=0$, respectively) where the band structure
  of boundary fermions exhibits semi-Dirac anisotropy. We
  characterize each phase at $T=0$ by explicit solutions to the bulk equations of motion in the infra-red,
  and determine that the critical point's spacetime is a Lifshitz geometry, whose dynamical critical exponent is
  approximately equal to $2$. We also find that this anisotropy induces a non-trivial
  scaling of the shear viscosity-entropy density ratio with respect to temperature in the $T\to 0$ limit, and find evidence
  that the anisotropic phase of the system corresponds to a finite-temperature quantum critical phase.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Ground State of Atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$: The Crucial Role of Frustrated Zigzag Chains Revealed by Inelastic Neutron Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75 meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize atacamite's low-energy magnetism.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects (CBSE) in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</description>

      <title>Soliton Transitions Mediated by Skin-Mode Localization and Band Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons, typically resulting from a competition between band dispersion and nonlinearity, occur in lattices featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect as nonlinearity increases, accompanied by a transition in localization from linear skin modes to solitons. However, localization does not disentangle the role of skin modes in the soliton formation from that of band dispersion. Here, in such lattices, we uncover two distinct soliton phases, skin-mode-assisted solitons (SMASs) and nonreciprocity-dressed solitons (NRDSs). Rooted in fundamentally different mechanisms, SMASs originate from skin effect, while NRDSs stem from band nonreciprocity, each exhibiting unique spatial profiles. Using a stacked Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model as a prototype, we delineate the phase diagram of SMASs and NRDSs, each having clear phase boundaries. To interpret them, we formulate a Wannier-function-based nonlinear Hamiltonian, showing that soliton formation depends critically on how skin-mode localization and band nonreciprocity suppress or enhance wave dispersion. For SMASs, skin-mode localization reduces wave broadening at the localization sites, thereby lowering the formation threshold. This soliton phase is observable from edge dynamics and accompanied by a dynamical stability reentrance when transitioning from linear skin modes. In contrast, NRDSs, as well as their thresholds, originate from bulk band nonreciprocity and persist under periodic boundary conditions. Our framework offers predictive tools for characterizing and engineering solitons in experimentally realizable non-Hermitian systems, spanning optics to mechanics.</description>

      <title>Design and demonstration of a direct air capture system with moisture-driven CO2 delivery into aqueous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture (DAC) system was designed and demonstrated. A laboratory-scale system delivering ~1 g CO2 per day was demonstrated in a laminar flow hood and a small pilot-scale system that could deliver ~100 g CO2 daily was operated outdoors in a 4.2 m2 (areal surface area) raceway pond. Elongated mesh tube packets were designed to contain AER beads with high surface area for contacting the air and were found to reduce drying and CO2 loading time ~4-fold over larger mesh bags. Whereas this system was designed for CO2 delivery for cultivating photosynthetic microbes, its potential uses are much broader and include CO2 use in the food and beverage industry, conversion to fuels and chemicals, and sequestration. Techno-economic assessments for a practical scenario based on current results are \$670/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$280/tonne to extract CO2 from solution, purify and compress to 15 MPa for sequestration. An aspirational scenario modelling reasonable improvements to develop AER sorbents with a capacity of 4 mmol CO2 per gram of sorbent and water uptake of 50 wt.%, which leads to sorbent drying and loading within 1 h, shows a potential to reach \$51/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$109/tonne to get to 15 MPa for sequestration. Life cycle analysis shows the aspirational moisture-driven process uses up to 87% less energy than thermal and/or vacuum swing DAC by using energy from water evaporation; however, ~330 wt.% water uptake by the sorbent contained in a hydrophilic mesh packets leads to ~33-fold higher water use than the thermodynamic limits, which emphasizes future research is needed to increase sorbent hydrophobicity while maintaining and further increasing ion exchange capacity needed to bind CO2.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions to the shrinking core model and their interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shrinking core model describes the reaction of a spherical solid particle with a surrounding fluid. In this work, we revisit the SCM by deriving it from the underlying physical processes and performing a careful non-dimensionalisation, which highlights the limitations of the commonly used pseudo-steady-state approximation, particularly in liquid-solid systems where fluid and solid densities are comparable. To address these limitations, we derive approximate analytical solutions using a perturbation method that improves upon the pseudo-steady-state model. We also obtain a small-time solution capturing early transient behavior. A semi-implicit finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the full model numerically and benchmark the analytical approximations. We demonstrate that the perturbation solution provides significantly improved accuracy over the pseudo-steady-state model, especially in diffusion-limited regimes. Finally, we propose a simple fitting procedure combining the perturbation with the early-time solutions to estimate physical parameters from experimental data at minimal computational cost.</description>
