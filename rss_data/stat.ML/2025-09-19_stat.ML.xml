      <title>Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Learning Rate Should Scale Inversely with High-Order Data Moments in High-Dimensional Online Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of high-order moments on the learning dynamics of an online Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm under a high-dimensional data model composed of a weighted sum of two non-Gaussian random variables. This model allows precise control of the input moment structure via a weighting parameter. Building on an existing ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based analysis in the high-dimensional limit, we demonstrate that as the high-order moments increase, the algorithm exhibits slower convergence and demands both a lower learning rate and greater initial alignment to achieve informative solutions. Our findings highlight the algorithm's sensitivity to the statistical structure of the input data, particularly its moment characteristics. Furthermore, the ODE framework reveals a critical learning rate threshold necessary for learning when moments approach their maximum. These insights motivate future directions in moment-aware initialization and adaptive learning rate strategies to counteract the degradation in learning speed caused by high non-Gaussianity, thereby enhancing the robustness and efficiency of ICA in complex, high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Online Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization: A Case Study of Outlier Detection and Robust Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is a foundational framework for supervised learning but primarily optimizes average-case performance, often neglecting fairness and robustness considerations. Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization (TERM) extends ERM by introducing an exponential tilt hyperparameter $t$ to balance average-case accuracy with worst-case fairness and robustness. However, in online or streaming settings where data arrive one sample at a time, the classical TERM objective degenerates to standard ERM, losing tilt sensitivity. We address this limitation by proposing an online TERM formulation that removes the logarithm from the classical objective, preserving tilt effects without additional computational or memory overhead. This formulation enables a continuous trade-off controlled by $t$, smoothly interpolating between ERM ($t \to 0$), fairness emphasis ($t &gt; 0$), and robustness to outliers ($t &lt; 0$). We empirically validate online TERM on two representative streaming tasks: robust linear regression with adversarial outliers and minority-class detection in binary classification. Our results demonstrate that negative tilting effectively suppresses outlier influence, while positive tilting improves recall with minimal impact on precision, all at per-sample computational cost equivalent to ERM. Online TERM thus recovers the full robustness-fairness spectrum of classical TERM in an efficient single-sample learning regime.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Study of In-context Learning with Random Transformers through Equivalent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of pretrained Transformers in the setting of nonlinear regression. Specifically, we focus on a random Transformer with a nonlinear MLP head where the first layer is randomly initialized and fixed while the second layer is trained. Furthermore, we consider an asymptotic regime where the context length, input dimension, hidden dimension, number of training tasks, and number of training samples jointly grow. In this setting, we show that the random Transformer behaves equivalent to a finite-degree Hermite polynomial model in terms of ICL error. This equivalence is validated through simulations across varying activation functions, context lengths, hidden layer widths (revealing a double-descent phenomenon), and regularization settings. Our results offer theoretical and empirical insights into when and how MLP layers enhance ICL, and how nonlinearity and over-parameterization influence model performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</description>

      <title>FedAVOT: Exact Distribution Alignment in Federated Learning via Masked Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training without sharing raw data, but suffers when client participation is partial. In practice, the distribution of available users (\emph{availability distribution} $q$) rarely aligns with the distribution defining the optimization objective (\emph{importance distribution} $p$), leading to biased and unstable updates under classical FedAvg. We propose \textbf{Fereated AVerage with Optimal Transport (\textbf{FedAVOT})}, which formulates aggregation as a masked optimal transport problem aligning $q$ and $p$. Using Sinkhorn scaling, \textbf{FedAVOT} computes transport-based aggregation weights with provable convergence guarantees. \textbf{FedAVOT} achieves a standard $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under a nonsmooth convex FL setting, independent of the number of participating users per round. Our experiments confirm drastically improved performance compared to FedAvg across heterogeneous, fairness-sensitive, and low-availability regimes, even when only two clients participate per round.</description>

      <title>Data coarse graining can improve model performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.</description>

      <title>Rate doubly robust estimation for weighted average treatment effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weighted average treatment effect (WATE) defines a versatile class of causal estimands for populations characterized by propensity score weights, including the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment effect on the treated (ATT), on controls (ATC), and for the overlap population (ATO). WATE has broad applicability in social and medical research, as many datasets from these fields align with its framework. However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation into the robustness and efficiency conditions for WATE estimation. Although doubly robust (DR) estimators are well-studied for ATE, their applicability to other WATEs remains uncertain. This paper investigates whether widely used WATEs admit DR or rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and assesses the role of nuisance function accuracy, particularly with machine learning. Using semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF) theory and double/debiased machine learning (DML), we propose three RDR estimators under specific rate and regularity conditions and evaluate their performance via Monte Carlo simulations. Applications to NHANES data on smoking and blood lead levels, and SIPP data on 401(k) eligibility, demonstrate the methods' practical relevance in medical and social sciences.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Learning from Open-Set Label Shift Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the open-set label shift problem, where the test data may include a novel class absent from training. This setting is challenging because both the class proportions and the distribution of the novel class are not identifiable without extra assumptions. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive separability conditions, prior knowledge, or computationally infeasible procedures, and some may lack theoretical guarantees. We propose a semiparametric density ratio model framework that ensures identifiability while allowing overlap between novel and known classes. Within this framework, we develop maximum empirical likelihood estimators and confidence intervals for class proportions, establish their asymptotic validity, and design a stable Expectation-Maximization algorithm for computation. We further construct an approximately optimal classifier based on posterior probabilities with theoretical guarantees. Simulations and a real data application confirm that our methods improve both estimation accuracy and classification performance compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Template-Based Cortical Surface Reconstruction with Minimal Energy Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new adaptive step-size strategy for convex optimization with stochastic gradient that exploits the local geometry of the objective function only by means of a first-order stochastic oracle and without any hyper-parameter tuning. The method comes from a theoretically-grounded adaptation of the Adaptive Gradient Descent Without Descent method to the stochastic setting. We prove the convergence of stochastic gradient descent with our step-size under various assumptions, and we show that it empirically competes against tuned baselines.</description>

      <title>Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL) framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs and is freely available at https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive sensing.</description>

      <title>Consistent causal discovery with equal error variances: a least-squares perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the true causal structure among a set of variables, generated by a linear acyclic structural equation model (SEM) with the error terms being independent and having equal variances. It is well-known that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding the causal structure is uniquely identifiable under this assumption. In this work, we establish that the sum of minimum expected squared errors for every variable, while predicted by the best linear combination of its parent variables, is minimised if and only if the causal structure is represented by any supergraph of the true DAG. This property is further utilised to design a Bayesian DAG selection method that recovers the true graph consistently.</description>

      <title>Explaining deep learning for ECG using time-localized clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, enabling automatic annotation, disease screening, and prognosis beyond traditional clinical capabilities. However, understanding these models remains a challenge, limiting interpretation and gaining knowledge from these developments. In this work, we propose a novel interpretability method for convolutional neural networks applied to ECG analysis. Our approach extracts time-localized clusters from the model's internal representations, segmenting the ECG according to the learned characteristics while quantifying the uncertainty of these representations. This allows us to visualize how different waveform regions contribute to the model's predictions and assess the certainty of its decisions. By providing a structured and interpretable view of deep learning models for ECG, our method enhances trust in AI-driven diagnostics and facilitates the discovery of clinically relevant electrophysiological patterns.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider ordinary least squares estimation and variations on least squares estimation such as penalized (regularized) least squares and spectral shrinkage estimates for problems with p &gt; n and associated problems with prediction of new observations. After the introduction of Section 1, Section 2 examines a number of commonly used estimators for p &gt; n. Section 3 introduces prediction with p &gt; n. Section 4 introduces notational changes to facilitate discussion of overfitting and Section 5 illustrates the phenomenon of double descent. We conclude with some final comments.</description>

      <title>Compactly-supported nonstationary kernels for computing exact Gaussian processes on big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning method with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function approximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of nonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary kernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and exact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more than about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity assumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts to address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which can involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly derive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and nonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and leverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive data sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel relative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of synthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on more than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More broadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable, sparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete with a wide variety of machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Tight PAC-Bayesian Risk Certificates for Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive representation learning is a modern paradigm for learning representations of unlabeled data via augmentations -- precisely, contrastive models learn to embed semantically similar pairs of samples (positive pairs) closer than independently drawn samples (negative samples). In spite of its empirical success and widespread use in foundation models, statistical theory for contrastive learning remains less explored. Recent works have developed generalization error bounds for contrastive losses, but the resulting risk certificates are either vacuous (certificates based on Rademacher complexity or $f$-divergence) or require strong assumptions about samples that are unreasonable in practice. The present paper develops non-vacuous PAC-Bayesian risk certificates for contrastive representation learning, considering the practical considerations of the popular SimCLR framework. Notably, we take into account that SimCLR reuses positive pairs of augmented data as negative samples for other data, thereby inducing strong dependence and making classical PAC or PAC-Bayesian bounds inapplicable. We further refine existing bounds on the downstream classification loss by incorporating SimCLR-specific factors, including data augmentation and temperature scaling, and derive risk certificates for the contrastive zero-one risk. The resulting bounds for contrastive loss and downstream prediction are much tighter than those of previous risk certificates, as demonstrated by experiments on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Gap-Dependent Bounds for Federated $Q$-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first gap-dependent analysis of regret and communication cost for on-policy federated $Q$-Learning in tabular episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). Existing FRL methods focus on worst-case scenarios, leading to $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bounds and communication cost bounds with a $\log T$ term scaling with the number of agents $M$, states $S$, and actions $A$, where $T$ is the average total number of steps per agent. In contrast, our novel framework leverages the benign structures of MDPs, such as a strictly positive suboptimality gap, to achieve a $\log T$-type regret bound and a refined communication cost bound that disentangles exploration and exploitation. Our gap-dependent regret bound reveals a distinct multi-agent speedup pattern, and our gap-dependent communication cost bound removes the dependence on $MSA$ from the $\log T$ term. Notably, our gap-dependent communication cost bound also yields a better global switching cost when $M=1$, removing $SA$ from the $\log T$ term.</description>

      <title>Differentially private multivariate medians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to $d = 100$, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning under Diffusion Models for Data with Jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven effective in solving complex decision-making tasks across various domains, but challenges remain in continuous-time settings, particularly when state dynamics are governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jump components. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing the Mean-Square Bipower Variation Error (MSBVE) algorithm, which enhances robustness and convergence in scenarios involving significant stochastic noise and jumps. We first revisit the Mean-Square TD Error (MSTDE) algorithm, commonly used in continuous-time RL, and highlight its limitations in handling jumps in state dynamics. The proposed MSBVE algorithm minimizes the mean-square quadratic variation error, offering improved performance over MSTDE in environments characterized by SDEs with jumps. Simulations and formal proofs demonstrate that the MSBVE algorithm reliably estimates the value function in complex settings, surpassing MSTDE's performance when faced with jump processes. These findings underscore the importance of alternative error metrics to improve the resilience and effectiveness of RL algorithms in continuous-time frameworks.</description>

Abstract: The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a widely used method for data assimilation in high-dimensional systems, with an ensemble update step equivalent to an empirical version of the Matheron update popular in Gaussian process regression -- a connection that links half a century of data-assimilation engineering to modern path-wise GP sampling.
  This paper provides a compact introduction to this simple but under-exploited connection, with necessary definitions accessible to all fields involved.

      <title>Preference Isolation Forest for Structure-based Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Descent Algorithms for Optimization: Accelerated Rates via Randomized Integration Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian flow for optimization (HF-opt), which simulates the Hamiltonian dynamics for some integration time and resets the velocity to $0$ to decrease the objective function; this is the optimization analogue of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling. For short integration time, HF-opt has the same convergence rates as gradient descent for minimizing strongly and weakly convex functions. We show that by randomizing the integration time in HF-opt, the resulting randomized Hamiltonian flow (RHF) achieves accelerated convergence rates in continuous time, similar to the rates for the accelerated gradient flow. We study a discrete-time implementation of RHF as the randomized Hamiltonian gradient descent (RHGD) algorithm. We prove that RHGD achieves the same accelerated convergence rates as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimizing smooth strongly and weakly convex functions. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate that RHGD is competitive with classical accelerated methods such as AGD across all settings and outperforms them in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Why and How of Convex Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey reviews a clustering method based on solving a convex optimization problem. Despite the plethora of existing clustering methods, convex clustering has several uncommon features that distinguish it from prior art. The optimization problem is free of spurious local minima, and its unique global minimizer is stable with respect to all its inputs, including the data, a tuning parameter, and weight hyperparameters. Its single tuning parameter controls the number of clusters and can be chosen using standard techniques from penalized regression. We give intuition into the behavior and theory for convex clustering as well as practical guidance. We highlight important algorithms and discuss how their computational costs scale with the problem size. Finally, we highlight the breadth of its uses and flexibility to be combined and integrated with other inferential methods.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Field-of-View Enhanced Signal-Dependent Binauralization of Moving Talkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mixture of experts framework for field-of-view enhancement in binaural signal matching. Our approach enables dynamic spatial audio rendering that adapts to continuous talker motion, allowing users to emphasize or suppress sounds from selected directions while preserving natural binaural cues. Unlike traditional methods that rely on explicit direction-of-arrival estimation or operate in the Ambisonics domain, our signal-dependent framework combines multiple binaural filters in an online manner using implicit localization. This allows for real-time tracking and enhancement of moving sound sources, supporting applications such as speech focus, noise reduction, and world-locked audio in augmented and virtual reality. The method is agnostic to array geometry offering a flexible solution for spatial audio capture and personalized playback in next-generation consumer audio devices.</description>
