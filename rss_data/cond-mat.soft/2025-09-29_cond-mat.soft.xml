      <title>From Phenomenology to a Nonlinear Model of Dynamic Snap-Through of an Elastica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating the clamped ends of a buckled elastica induces a snap-through instability. Predicting the limit point and determining the equilibria at the start and end of the snap are routine computations in the quasi-static setting. The instability itself, however, is dynamic, and quite violently so. We propose an energy-preserving nonlinear single degree of freedom model for this dynamic phenomenon in the case of a symmetrically deforming elastica. The model hinges on a surprising observation relating elastica profiles during the free dynamic snap with a specific sequence of geometrically-constrained elastic energy minimizing configurations. We corroborate this phenomenological observation over a significant range of arch depths through experiments and finite element simulations. The resulting model does not rely on modal expansions, explicit slowness assumptions, or linearization of the arch's kinematics. Instead, the model is effective because its solutions approximate the action integral well. The model provides distinctive computational benefits and new insights into the snap-through phenomenon. Our study is motivated by an application harnessing snap-through instabilities in submerged ribbons for underwater propulsion. We briefly describe its novel working principle and discuss its relationship to the problem studied.</description>

      <title>Least-Dissipation Interfaces in Fully Miscible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp interfaces in miscible fluids have long been observed, yet classical theory associates them only with phase coexistence and non-convex free energies. We present a minimal variational frame work where adding a Fermi-Dirac (FD) free energy to a convex bulk contribution preserves miscibility, while the convex term drops out in the gradient balance, leaving the FD part to set a logistic profile by the principle of least dissipation. After formation, the FD interface propagates diffusively and later broadens by ripening, giving a unified view of interfacial dynamics in miscible fluids.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Response of Deformable Microchannels under Pressure-Driven Flow of Aqueous Polymer Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic channels are integral to biomedical technology and process engineering, offering versatility in handling fluids with complex properties, often a combination of viscous and elastic attributes. Despite significant advancements in understanding small-scale fluid-structure interactions, however, experimental insights on the flow of complex fluids in deformable microchannels remain limited. Here, we present controlled experiments using polymer solutions as model viscoelastic fluids to examine the effects of polymer concentration on the elasto-mechanical characteristics of slender cylindrical microchannels. The findings indicate significant differences in fluid-structure interactions between dilute and semi-dilute polymer solutions with varying molecular weights. At higher polymer concentrations, these interactions intensify, leading to reduced pressure drops in high-shear regions and increased pressure drops in low-shear areas, linked to local wall deformation. The increased elasticity of higher concentration solutions further enhances local deformation, disrupts flow, and dissipates energy, resulting in a non-linear rise in pressure drop. This behaviour is aggravated by the solutions increased apparent viscosity due to the entangled polymer network. A theoretical model of flow-induced deformation is also developed, accounting for polymer chain extensibility. These insights highlight the importance of polymer constitution in optimizing the flow characteristics, advancing the development of adaptive microfluidic devices in biological and industrial applications for optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal coalescence-breakup dynamics in concentrated emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense stabilized emulsions are mixtures of immiscible fluids where the high-volume fraction droplet dispersed phase is stabilized against coalescence by steric interactions. The production of emulsions involves high-shear flows and it is well known that at a critical volume fraction the emulsion loses stability, undergoing an extremely rapid process where the fluid components in the emulsion exchange roles. This process, called catastrophic phase inversion, which resembles in several respects a dynamical phase transition, has remained widely elusive from an experimental and theoretical point of view. In this work, we present state-of-the-art experimental and numerical data to support a dynamical-system framework capable of precisely highlighting the dynamics occurring in the system as it approaches the catastrophic phase inversion. Our study clearly highlights that at high volume fractions, dynamical changes in the emulsion morphology, due to coalescence and breakup of droplets, play a critical role in determining emulsion's rheology and stability. Additionally, we show that at approaching the critical volume fractions, the dynamics can be simplified as being controlled by the dynamics of a correlation length represented, in our systems, by the size of the largest droplet. This dynamics shares a close connection with non-reciprocal phase transition where two different physical mechanisms, coalescence and breakups, can get out of balance leading to large non-symmetric periodic excursions in phase space. We clarify the phenomenology observed and quantitatively explain the essential aspect of the highly complex dynamics of stabilized emulsions undergoing catastrophic phase inversion.</description>

      <title>Capillarity in Stationary Random Granular Media: Distribution-Aware Screening and Quantitative Supercell Sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative framework to determine the minimal periodic supercell required for representative simulations of capillarity-screened Darcy flow in stationary random, polydisperse granular media. The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers.</description>

      <title>Polymer-based probabilistic bits for thermodynamic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Interface and Thermophysical Properties of R32 Refrigerant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the urgent demand for efficient cooling in microelectronics and advanced thermal management systems, difluoromethane (R32/CH2F2) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its favorable thermophysical properties, including high heat transfer efficiency and low viscosity. While bulk properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity have been widely studied, interfacial properties including surface tension and interfacial thickness remain comparatively underexplored, despite their importance in phase-transition dynamics. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from 180 K-300 K using an optimized transferable force field for fluoropropenes with enhanced electrostatics to assess both bulk and interfacial behavior of R32. Simulations reproduced density within +/- 2.1%, viscosity within 3.05%, and thermal conductivity within 7.41% of NIST reference data. Heat capacities (Cp and Cv) were predicted within 5%. For interfacial properties, surface tension trends were reproduced within 15.8% deviation, and the vapor-liquid coexistence curve closely matched reference data, yielding a critical temperature of 345.7 K (1.6% deviation) and a critical density of 0.397 g/cm3 (6.4% deviation). Importantly, the vapor-liquid interface exhibited strong temperature dependence, with interfacial thickness increasing by 290% between 180 K and 290 K. These validated results provide predictive molecular-level insights, particularly for interfacial properties that remain less characterized. By reducing property prediction errors in key parameters such as critical temperature, this work provides reliable inputs for heat-exchanger and system models. Beyond R32, the methodology offers a transferable framework for blended and next-generation low-GWP refrigerants, contributing to sustainable thermal management aligned with the 2027 EU F-Gas regulation and 2030 Kigali Amendment.</description>

      <title>Viscous Growth Law in Bubble Coarsening: A Molecular Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetics of bubble coarsening in a single component Lennard-Jones fluid using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. A homogeneous high-temperature system is quenched below the critical temperature to induce the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles within a dense liquid matrix. The structural evolution is characterized by two point correlation functions and the static structure factor, both of which exhibit dynamic scaling and sharp interfaces consistent with Porod law. The time-dependent characteristic length scale, extracted from the correlation function, shows a robust power law growth $\ell(t) \sim t^{\alpha}$. Finite size scaling analysis across different system sizes yields $\alpha \approx 1.0$, establishing that coarsening is dominated by viscous hydrodynamic interactions rather than classical diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening predicted by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory. These results provide atomistic evidence for fluid flow controlled coarsening in vapor-liquid systems and emphasize the need to go beyond diffusion-based theories to describe bubble dynamics in dense fluids.</description>

      <title>Electro-mechanical wrinkling of soft dielectric films bonded to hyperelastic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active control of wrinkling in soft film-substrate composites using electric fields is a critical challenge in tunable material systems.
  Here, we investigate the electro-mechanical instability of a soft dielectric film bonded to a hyperelastic substrate, revealing the fundamental mechanisms that enable on-demand surface patterning. For the linearized stability analysis, we use the Stroh formalism and the surface impedance method to obtain exact and sixth-order approximate bifurcation equations that signal the onset of wrinkles.
  We derive the explicit bifurcation equations giving the critical stretch and critical voltage for wrinkling, as well as the corresponding critical wavenumber.
  We look at scenarios where the voltage is kept constant and the stretch changes, and vice versa.
  We provide the thresholds of the shear modulus ratio $r_{\rm c}^0$ or pre-stretch $\lambda_{\rm c}^0$ below which the film-substrate system wrinkles mechanically, prior to the application of a voltage.
  These predictions offer theoretical guidance for practical structural design, as the shear modulus ratio $r$ and/or the pre-stretch $\lambda$ can be chosen to be slightly greater than $r_{\rm c}^0$ and/or $\lambda_{\rm c}^0$, so that the film-substrate system wrinkles with a small applied voltage.
  Finally, we simulate the full nonlinear behavior using the Finite Element method (FEniCS) to validate our formulas and conduct a post-buckling analysis. This work advances the fundamental understanding of electro-mechanical wrinkling instabilities in soft material systems. By enabling active control of surface morphologies via applied electric fields, our findings open new avenues for adaptive technologies in soft robotics, flexible electronics, smart surfaces, and bioinspired systems.</description>

      <title>Bananas for Tonks' gas: structural transitions in bent-core molecule bi-layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of particle geometry in the ordering of bilayers of bent-core particles using a simplified two-dimensional model. Particles are confined to two parallel one-dimensional layers and can adopt only two discrete orientations of their bent cores. By mapping the system exactly onto a pair of coupled Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit, we may obtain closed-form expressions for all correlation functions. The coupling between orientational and layer degrees of freedom produces remarkably rich behaviour, including crossovers between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orientational order, and states with polarised layers. Despite its simplicity, this exactly soluble model reproduces qualitative features of bent-core smectic liquid crystals and confined colloids, providing insight into the subtle role of particle geometry in driving structural correlations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature, yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. At high densities, this suppression generates an active nematic state, sustained by continuous defect creation and annihilation but lacking global order. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, which reduce the effective persistence length and enlarge the effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>

      <title>Coarsening of biomimetic condensates in a self-stirring active fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarsening, the process where larger structures grow at the expense of smaller ones, is a fundamental aspect of multiphase systems. The cell cytoplasm exemplifies an out-of-equilibrium multiphase system, where phase-separated condensates nucleate and expand within an active fluid made of biopolymers and energy-dependent enzymes. In this study, we explore how condensates grow in a self-stirring active fluid by examining the coarsening of biomimetic condensates embedded in a 3D reconstituted cytoskeleton composed of microtubules and molecular motors. The strong agreement among experiments, an active hydrodynamic model, and computer simulations offers a comprehensive framework that explains why self-similarity is absent in active coarsening and identifies the origins of the continuously changing coarsening exponents for both active and passive condensates. The dynamics of coarsening are primarily determined by the statistics of binary droplet collisions, which depend on their size-dependent motility, regardless of whether they are active or passive. These results reveal a unifying control parameter for the coarsening process and size distribution of active condensates, broadening our understanding of phase separation in out-of-equilibrium systems and potentially impacting materials science and biology.</description>

      <title>Emulating microbial run-and-tumble and tactic motion by stochastically reorienting synthetic active Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicating efficient and adaptable microbial navigation strategies, such as run and tumble (RnT) and tactic motions to synthetic active agents has been an enduring quest. To this end, we introduce a stochastic orientational reset (SOR) protocol, in which the propulsion direction of an active Brownian particle (ABP) is reassigned to a random orientation within a defined reset-cone. When the reset-cone is aligned with the instantaneous propulsion direction, ABPs reproduce the RnT dynamics of E. coli; when set along an attractant gradient, they exhibit taxis - with extensive adaptability in persistence through the angular width of the reset-cone and reset rate. We establish the robustness of this protocol across a broad range of swimming speeds using experiments, simulations, and analytical theory.</description>

      <title>Scallop Theorem for Swimming in Anisotropic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In isotropic fluids like water, micrometer-scale swimmers have evolved swim strokes to translate despite their tiny size. As described by Purcell in his Scallop Theorem, reciprocal motions, like those performed by a scallop, cannot drive swimming when inertial effects are absent, as is typical at micrometer length scales. Thus, microswimmers have evolved complex structures that can perform non-reciprocal swim strokes or body displacements to generate motion. Microswimmer dynamics in structured fluids differ fundamentally from those in isotropic fluids because of their inherent asymmetry. The orientation of elongated constituents and the topological defects that spontaneously form near microswimmers provide broken symmetries, even atequilibrium. This is sufficient for the dynamic disturbance of even the simplest isotropic swimmers to generate propulsion. We combine experiments on magnetically rotated colloids in nematic liquid crystals with analytic non-equilibrium solutions to formulate propulsion strategies for microswimmers in nematic fluids and determine how swimming velocity depends on the rotation rate, materials parameters, and forcing regimes. For example, we find that micro-scale spherical colloids swim effectively under continuous rotation and under reciprocal forcing.Thus, swim strokes that are ineffective in isotropic fluids are highly effective in nematic liquid crystals. In light of these observations, the Scallop Theorem is extended for structured fluids.</description>

      <title>Radiation Forces and Torques on Janus Cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of electromagnetic waves with dielectric Janus particles gives rise to radiation forces and torques, governed by the dielectric properties, interface orientation, and the size-to-wavelength ratio. In this study, we employ the Lattice Boltzmann Method to compute the radiation-induced drag, lift, and torque on circular Janus cylinders when illuminated by a transverse magnetic polarized plane wave. We analyze both metallo-dielectric and dielectric Janus cylinders. For metallo-dielectric Janus cylinders, LBM predictions are validated against analytical results, showing excellent agreement in far-field bistatic scattering width, radiation force, and torque across a range of dielectric constants and interface orientations. Extending the study to dielectric Janus cylinders, we explore how the dielectric contrast and interface orientation shape the optomechanical response. Our findings show that radiation-induced forces and torques can be harnessed to drive and control the motion of dielectric Janus particles in optofluidic, active, and self-assembling systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, competition and emergence of hierarchy: assembly of active colloids under combined electric and magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field induced assembly of reconfigurable structures with complex hierarchical configurations has recently become an area of intense research with the promise for exciting applications in programmable self-assembly and nano/microstructure fabrication. While a wide variety of structures, from crystals to glasses, to chains and oligomers have been produced by activating colloidal particles with electric and magnetic fields, a combined approach utilizing the capabilities of multiple field types offers a richer parameter space, enabling precise structural control and a higher degree of reconfigurability. Here we demonstrate the assembly of complex hierarchical colloidal superstructures using an electric field (AC) and magnetic field (DC) combination. In our chosen frequency regime, dipolar (magnetic and electric) and electrohydrodynamic interactions are comparable, leading to a rich phase space with a wide number of configurations which are tunable by relatively small changes of the field parameters. This is in contrast to the existing small number of studies on multi-field induced assembly that work in size and frequency regimes where the dominant mechanism is dipolar interaction induced assembly. We show that depending upon the direction and frequency of the applied fields, there can be three possibilities in structure formation: a) a cooperation among the fields b) a competition among the fields and c) hierarchical reorganization in which micrometer-sized particles form chains that are part of larger clusters or 'domains' spanning tens of micrometers. This versatile, easy to set up and fully reconfigurable approach of multi-field induced structure formation opens up new opportunities for bottom-up fabrication of smart materials, switchable photonic crystals, and modular microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly, slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity. Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%) by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance, highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping. This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES, Raman, FTIR).</description>

      <title>Sharp Interface Dynamics in a Minimal Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in non-reciprocally coupled systems recently led to the introduction of a minimal non-reciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model by Brauns and Marchetti in 2024 arXiv:2306.08868, which we refer to as the Brauns-Marchetti (BM) model. This model can be seen as a conservative counterpart to the spatially extended FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Lacking a gradient structure, the BM model was observed to exhibit interesting dynamics including traveling periodic wave-trains and other coherent structures, as well as spatiotemporal chaos in certain parameter regimes. In this paper, we derive an effective equation for the interface dynamics of solutions to the BM model in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the sharp-interface limit. The resulting system of equations is a generalization of the classical Mullins-Sekerka (MS) equations, which we refer to as the modified MS equations. We show that the modified MS equation shares some properties with its classical counterpart, but importantly, it is not in general a length minimizing flow. To illustrate the utility of this asymptotic reduction in the sharp interface limit, we perform a detailed analysis of stationary and periodic wave-trains, systematically deriving expressions for wave-train speeds and stability thresholds. The methods used here should be applicable to other non-reciprocally coupled CH models and therefore provide another avenue for their more detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Predicting the distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic colloids can be driven with time-varying fields to form clusters and voids that re-organize over vastly different timescales. However, the driving force behind these non-equilibrium dynamics is not well-understood. Here, we introduce a topological framework that predicts protected edge flows despite strong thermal motion. Notably, these edge flows produce shear stress that creates global rotation of clusters but not of voids. We verify this theory experimentally using micron-sized super-paramagnetic colloids to demonstrate these emergent physical predictions and show how they drive system re-organization differentially at long timescales. Our results elucidate fundamental principles that shape and control non-equilibrium colloidal aggregates.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory that combines the framework of irreversible thermodynamics with modified integral theorems to model arbitrarily curved and deforming membranes immersed in bulk fluid solutions. We study the coupling between the mechanics and permeability of a viscous and elastically-bendable membrane, and a multi-component bulk fluid solution. An equation for the internal entropy production for irreversibilities at the membrane is derived, determining the generalized thermodynamic forces and fluxes, from which we identify the deviatoric stress as a novel driving force for permeability. A complete set of equations of motion, constitutive laws, and boundary conditions to model the lipid membrane and bulk fluid system are provided.</description>

Abstract: A single light-driven Janus particle confined in a very thin oil droplet at an air--water interface displays intriguing dynamics. While laser activation induces rapid horizontal motion (1mm/s--1cm/s) by thermal Marangoni flow, the particle exhibits unexpected periodic circular motions or intermittent irregular motions. We show that the periodic trajectories are the result of a coupling between the self-propulsion of the particle and the spatiotemporal droplet thickness changes. We propose a simple model where the properties of the active particle trajectories are governed by capillary forces and torques due to the confinement of the particle in the thin droplet.</description>

Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the interactions that can occur at the interface between liquids and materials. It describes the phenomena of sorption (adsorption and absorption), permeation and leaching from a physicochemical perspective. In addition to examining these interactions, the historical context, detailing how these phenomena have been studied and demonstrated over time, it provides an understanding of the evolution of research in this field and the methodologies used to study these interactions, with a specific focus on polymer materials. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are presented as well as the equations that describe the processes involved, thus providing a scientific basis for understanding the complexities of container-content interactions.</description>

Abstract: We use simulation-based supervised machine learning and classical density functional theory to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena associated with phase coexistence in binary mixtures. For a prototypical symmetrical Lennard-Jones mixture our trained neural density functional yields accurate liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour binodals together with predictions for the variation of the associated interfacial tensions across the entire fluid phase diagram. From the latter we determine the contact angles at fluid-fluid interfaces along the line of triple-phase coexistence and confirm there can be no wetting transition in this symmetrical mixture.</description>

Abstract: We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air-permeable porous media hosts air within their pores. Upon removal from the interior of the material, these porous media have the tendency to reabsorb air from the surrounding, acting as a suction pump. Therefore, the technique used to convert porous media into a pump, consists of degassing the material to remove their air inside. The suction property when recovering the air, can be used to move a liquid through a microfluidic channel. Porous media pumps are very accurate devices to move liquids in a completely controlled way. {By studying the dynamics of the liquid front moved by these pumps, it is possible to extract characteristic properties of both the fluid and the porous material.} In this article, we have developed a theoretical mathematical model that precisely characterizes the dynamics of a liquid moved by a degassed porous media pump through a microchannel by comparing it with experimental data. {We have seen the differences between sealing the external surface of the pump so that it cannot absorb air from the outside, both mathematically and experimentally.} We have observed that, in all cases, the theory fits satisfactorily with the experiments, corroborating the validity of the model. The creation of microfluidic pumps using porous media can be a very useful tool in various fields due to its long operating time, small size and the fact that it operates without any external power source.</description>

Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation--dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L032053 (2025)].Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantifying and characterizing fluctuations far away from equilibrium is a challenging task. We discuss and experimentally confirm a series expansion for a driven classical system, relating the different non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving protocol. This series is valid from micro- to macroscopic length scales, and it encompasses the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid. The expansion states that the form of FDT remains valid away from equilibrium for Gaussian observables, up to the order presented. We show that this expansion agrees with the expansion of a known fluctuation theorem up to an unresolved difference regarding moments versus cumulants.</description>

Abstract: Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized multimodal phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the single and bimodal phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</description>
