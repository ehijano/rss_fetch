      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solution for Linear Complementarity Problem in Contact Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although a unique solution is guaranteed in the Linear complementarity problem (LCP) when the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ is positive definite, practical applications often involve cases where $\mathbf{M}$ is only positive semi-definite, leading to multiple possible solutions. However, empirical observations suggest that uniqueness can still emerge under certain structural conditions on the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ and vector $\mathbf{q}$. Motivated by an unresolved problem in nonlinear modeling for beam contact in directional drilling, this paper systematically investigates conditions under which a unique solution exists for LCPs with certain positive semi-definite matrices $\mathbf{M}$. We provide a rigorous proof demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this specific case and extend our findings to establish a generalized framework applicable to broader classes of LCPs. This framework enhances the understanding of LCP uniqueness conditions and provides theoretical guarantees for solving real-world problems where positive semi-definite matrices $\mathbf{M}$ arise.</description>

      <title>Value Function Approximation for Nonlinear MPC: Learning a Terminal Cost Function with a Descent Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to synthesize a terminal cost function for a nonlinear model predictive controller (MPC) through value function approximation using supervised learning. Existing methods enforce a descent property on the terminal cost function by construction, thereby restricting the class of terminal cost functions, which in turn can limit the performance and applicability of the MPC. We present a method to approximate the true cost-to-go with a general function approximator that is convex in its parameters, and impose the descent condition on a finite number of states. Through the scenario approach, we provide probabilistic guarantees on the descent condition of the terminal cost function over the continuous state space. We demonstrate and empirically verify our method in a numerical example. By learning a terminal cost function, the prediction horizon of the MPC can be significantly reduced, resulting in reduced online computational complexity while maintaining good closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Augmentation Algorithms for Total Variation-Regularized Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a class of integer optimization programs with a total variation-like regularizer and convex, separable constraints on a graph. Our approach makes use of the Graver basis, an optimality certificate for integer programs, which we characterize as corresponding to the collection of induced connected subgraphs of our graph. We demonstrate how to use this basis to craft an exact global optimization algorithm for the unconstrained problem recovering a method first shown in [16]. We then present a randomized heuristic algorithm for the constrained problem that samples improving moves from the Graver basis in a randomized variant of the simplex algorithm. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this randomized algorithm is competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art integer program solvers.</description>

      <title>Integrated Bus Fleet Electrification Planning Through Accelerated Logic-Based Benders Decomposition and Restriction Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet sustainability goals and regulatory requirements, transit agencies worldwide are planning partial and complete transitions to electric bus fleets. This paper presents the first comprehensive and computationally efficient multi-period optimization framework integrating the key planning decisions necessary to support such electrification initiatives. Our model, formulated as a two-stage integer program with integer subproblems, jointly optimizes yearly fleet and charging infrastructure investments as well as hourly vehicle scheduling and charging operations. To solve instances of practical relevance to proven optimality, we develop a logic-based Benders decomposition method enhanced by several techniques, including preprocessing, partial decomposition, and a range of classical and monotone Benders cuts derived from relaxations of the operational subproblems. These accelerations yield speedups of up to three orders of magnitude and lead to practical and theoretical insights into Benders cut selection. We also propose a heuristic tailored for long-term, citywide electrification planning. This approach, which imposes and progressively relaxes additional scheduling constraints, consistently delivers high-quality solutions with optimality gaps below 1% for instances an order of magnitude larger than those considered in prior studies. We illustrate our model using data from the Chicago public bus system, providing managerial insights into optimal investment and operational policies.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity properties and new valid inequalities for the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past thirty years, the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands has emerged as a canonical application of the integer L-shaped method, leading to an extensive body of literature and several methodological refinements. Recently, the disaggregated integer L-shaped (DL-shaped) method, which decomposes the recourse function by customer rather than treating it as an aggregate cost, has been proposed and successfully applied under the detour-to-depot recourse policy. However, the validity of this new approach and its generalizability to other policies have not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of the DL-shaped method, namely, the superadditivity of the recourse function under concatenation. We demonstrate that the optimal restocking policy satisfies this superadditivity property. Moreover, we rectify an incorrect argument from the original paper on the DL-shaped method to rigorously establish its validity under the detour-to-depot policy. We then develop a DL-shaped algorithm tailored to the optimal restocking policy. Our algorithm exploits new dynamic programming-based lower bounds on the optimal restocking recourse function. We also introduce new valid inequalities that generalize the original DL-shaped cuts and speed up computations by an order of magnitude. Computational experiments show that our DL-shaped algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art integer L-shaped algorithm from the literature. We solve several open instances to optimality, including 14 single-vehicle instances, which constitute the most challenging variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>Kahan's Automatic Step-Size Control for Unconstrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Barzilai and Borwein (BB) gradient method is one of the most widely-used line-search gradient methods. It computes the step-size for the current iterate by using the information carried in the previous iteration. Recently, William Kahan [Kahan, Automatic Step-Size Control for Minimization Iterations, Technical report, University of California, Berkeley CA, USA, 2019] proposed new Gradient Descent (KGD) step-size strategies which iterate the step-size itself by effectively utilizing the information in the previous iteration. In the quadratic model, such a new step-size is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the long BB step, but no rigorous mathematical proof of its efficiency and effectiveness for the general unconstrained minimization is available. In this paper, by this equivalence with the long BB step, we first derive a short version of KGD step-size and show that, for the strongly convex quadratic model with a Hessian matrix $H$, both the long and short KGD step-size (and hence BB step-sizes) gradient methods converge at least R-linearly with a rate $1-\frac{1}{{\rm cond}(H)}$. For the general unconstrained minimization, we further propose an adaptive framework to effectively use the KGD step-sizes; global convergence and local R-linear convergence rate are proved. Numerical experiments are conducted on the CUTEst collection as well as the practical logistic regression problems, and we compare the performance of the proposed methods with various BB step-size approaches and other recently proposed adaptive gradient methods to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Analytical Framework for the Nonlinear Best-Worst Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To eliminate the need for optimization software in calculating weights using the nonlinear model of the Best-Worst Method (BWM), Wu et al. proposed an analytical framework for deriving optimal interval-weights. They also introduced a secondary objective function to select the best optimal weight set. However, their framework is only compatible with a single Decision-Maker (DM) and preferences quantified using the Saaty scale. In this research, we generalize their framework to accommodate any number of DMs and any scale. We first derive an analytical expression for optimal interval-weights and select the best optimal weight set. After demonstrating that the values of Consistency Index (CI) for the Saaty scale in the existing literature are not well-defined, we derive n formula for computing CI. We also derive analytical expressions for the Consistency Ratio (CR), enabling its use as an input-based consistency indicator and proving that CR satisfies some key properties, ensuring its reliability as a consistency indicator. Furthermore, we observe that criteria with equal preferences may get different weights when multiple best/worst criteria are present. To address this limitation, we modify the original optimization model for weight computation in such instances, solve it analytically to obtain optimal interval-weights, and select the best optimal weight set. Finally, we demonstrate and validate the proposed approach using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Density Steering via the Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the data-driven chance-constrained density steering problem using the Gromov-Wasserstein metric. The underlying dynamical system is an unknown linear controlled recursion, with the assumption that sufficiently rich input-output data from pre-operational experiments are available. The initial state is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, while the terminal state is required to match a specified Gaussian distribution. We reformulate the resulting optimal control problem as a difference-of-convex program and show that it can be efficiently and tractably solved using the DC algorithm. Numerical results validate our approach through various data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Vibroseis Vehicle Routing Problem with Spatio-Temporal Coupled Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous multi vibroseis vehicle operations are central to modern land seismic exploration and can be modeled as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). A critical distinction from classical VRPs, however, is the need for a minimum start-time interval between nearby sources to prevent signal interference. This constraint introduces strong spatio-temporal coupling, as one vehicle's route directly impacts the schedules of others, leading to potential forced waits. This paper defines this novel problem as the Vibroseis Vehicle Routing Problem with Spatio-Temporal Coupled Constraints (STCVRP) and aims to minimize the makespan.
  To systematically investigate this problem, we first establish a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to provide a precise mathematical description. As the MILP is intractable for realistic-scale instances, we subsequently develop a discrete-event simulation model. This model accurately calculates the true makespan of any candidate solution under all constraints, thereby serving as a high-fidelity fitness evaluation function for metaheuristics. To solve the problem, we design and implement a simulation-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework capable of searching the solution space efficiently. Finally, to validate the proposed framework and facilitate future research, we construct and release a new benchmark suite for the STCVRP. We solve the instances using both exact methods and our GA, with experimental results demonstrating the problem's high complexity and the effectiveness of the metaheuristic approach, providing a set of high-quality initial solutions for the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization via RC-ALADIN with Efficient Quantized Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized consensus optimization over directed graphs with limited communication bandwidth. We introduce a novel decentralized optimization algorithm that combines the Reduced Consensus Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (RC-ALADIN) method with a finite time quantized coordination protocol, enabling quantized information exchange among nodes. Assuming the nodes' local objective functions are $\mu$-strongly convex and simply smooth, we establish global convergence at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with the neighborhood size determined by the quantization level. Additionally, we show that the same convergence result also holds for the case where the local objective functions are convex and $L$-smooth. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm compares favorably against algorithms in the current literature while exhibiting communication efficient operation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various inequalities exist between the area of a triangle, the perimeter squared $(a+b+c)^2$ and the isoperimetric deficit $Q=(a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2$. The direct and reverse Finsler-Hadwiger inequalities correspond to the best linear inequalities between the three quantities mentioned above. In this paper, the sharpest inequalities between these three quantities are found explicitly. The techniques used involve Blaschke-Santal\'o diagrams and constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Computational Methods and Verification Theorem for Portfolio-Consumption Optimization under Exponential O-U Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of optimal portfolio-consumption policies in a multi-asset financial market, where the n risky assets follow Exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, along with one risk-free bond. The investor's preferences are modeled using Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility with state-dependent stochastic discounting. The problem can be formulated as a high-dimensional stochastic optimal control problem, wherein the associated value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which constitutes a necessary condition for optimality. We apply a variable separation technique to transform the HJB equation to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then a class of hybrid numerical approaches that integrate exponential Rosenbrock-type methods with Runge-Kutta methods is proposed to solve the ODE system. More importantly, we establish a rigorous verification theorem that provides sufficient conditions for the existence of value function and admissible optimal control, which can be verified numerically. A series of experiments are performed, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms the conventional grid-based method in both accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, the numerically derived optimal policy achieves superior performance over all other considered admissible policies.</description>

      <title>Tailored First-order and Interior-point methods and a new semidefinite programming hierarchy for entanglement detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, yet its reliable detection in high-dimensional or noisy systems remains a fundamental computational challenge. Semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT) hierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their practical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper, we introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and DPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT, while incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.
  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using partition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations that satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are well-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods (IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs (Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a least-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic programming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of producing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where states lie near the boundary of separability.
  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our algorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In particular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective entanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach offers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones. Our results highlight the benefits of tailoring algorithmic formulations to hierarchy structure to advance entanglement detection at scale.</description>

Abstract: Distributed optimization and learning algorithms are designed to operate over large scale networks enabling processing of vast amounts of data effectively and efficiently. One of the main challenges for ensuring a smooth learning process in gradient-based methods is the appropriate selection of a learning stepsize. Most current distributed approaches let individual nodes adapt their stepsizes locally. However, this may introduce stepsize heterogeneity in the network, thus disrupting the learning process and potentially leading to divergence. In this paper, we propose a distributed learning algorithm that incorporates a novel mechanism for automating stepsize selection among nodes. Our main idea relies on implementing a finite time coordination algorithm for eliminating stepsize heterogeneity among nodes. We analyze the operation of our algorithm and we establish its convergence to the optimal solution. We conclude our paper with numerical simulations for a linear regression problem, showcasing that eliminating stepsize heterogeneity enhances convergence speed and accuracy against current approaches.</description>

      <title>An Implemention of Two-Phase Image Segmentation using the Split Bregman Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in \cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries. Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.</description>

      <title>V*: An Efficient Motion Planning Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing, V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and dynamic coordination.</description>

      <title>Proximal optimal transport divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulations and adversarial learning. The proximal operator associated with the proximal optimal transport divergence can be interpreted as a transport map that pushes a reference distribution toward the optimal generative distribution, which approximates the target distribution that is only accessible through data samples. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of classical optimal transport, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward continuity equation. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributionally robust optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Linear Energy System Optimization: A Systematic Review on Parallelization Strategies via Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As renewable energy integration, sector coupling, and spatiotemporal detail increase, energy system optimization models grow in size and complexity, often pushing solvers to their performance limits. This systematic review explores parallelization strategies that can address these challenges. We first propose a classification scheme for linear energy system optimization models, covering their analytical focus, mathematical structure, and scope. We then review parallel decomposition methods, finding that while many offer performance benefits, no single approach is universally superior. The lack of standardized benchmark suites further complicates comparison. To address this, we recommend essential criteria for future benchmarks and minimum reporting standards. We also survey available software tools for parallel decomposition, including modular frameworks and algorithmic abstractions. Though centered on energy system models, our insights extend to the broader operations research field.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fleet Upgrade Decisions with Machine-Learning Enhanced Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management.</description>

      <title>Decision-focused predictions via pessimistic bilevel optimization: complexity and algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17640v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dealing with uncertainty in optimization parameters is an important and longstanding challenge. Typically, uncertain parameters are predicted accurately, and then a deterministic optimization problem is solved. However, the decisions produced by this so-called predict-then-optimize procedure can be highly sensitive to uncertain parameters. In this work, we contribute to recent efforts in producing decision-focused predictions, i.e., to build predictive models that are constructed with the goal of minimizing a regret measure on the decisions taken with them. We begin by formulating the exact expected regret minimization as a pessimistic bilevel optimization model. Then, we show computational complexity results of this problem, including its membership in NP. In combination with a known NP-hardness result, this establishes NP-completeness and discards its hardness in higher complexity classes. Using duality arguments, we reformulate it as a non-convex quadratic optimization problem. Finally, leveraging the quadratic reformulation, we show various computational techniques to achieve empirical tractability. We report extensive computational results on shortest-path and bipartite matching instances with uncertain cost vectors. Our results indicate that our approach can improve training performance over the approach of Elmachtoub and Grigas (2022), a state-of-the-art method for decision-focused learning.</description>

      <title>Data Collaboration Analysis with Orthonormal Basis Selection and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02780v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data Collaboration (DC) enables multiple parties to jointly train a model without exposing their private datasets. Each party privately transforms its data using a secret linear basis and shares only the resulting intermediate representations. Existing theory asserts that any target basis spanning the same subspace as the secret bases should suffice; however, empirical evidence reveals that the particular choice of target basis significantly influences model accuracy and stability. In this paper, we introduce Orthonormal Data Collaboration (ODC), a novel DC framework that explicitly enforces orthonormality constraints on both the secret and target bases. Under these constraints, the basis alignment step reduces precisely to the classical Orthogonal Procrustes Problem, admitting a closed-form solution. We rigorously establish that the resulting orthonormal change-of-basis matrices achieve orthogonal concordance, aligning all parties' intermediate representations up to a common orthogonal transformation. Consequently, downstream model performance becomes invariant to the specific choice of orthonormal target basis. Computationally, ODC substantially reduces alignment complexity from O(\min\{a,(cl)^2,a^2cl) to O(acl^2) where a denotes anchor data size, l the latent dimension, and c the number of collaborating parties. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm the theoretical advantages of ODC, demonstrating alignment speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art DC methods, alongside comparable or superior accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. ODC maintains robust privacy under the semi-honest threat model and requires only a single round of communication. These results establish ODC as a practically advantageous and computationally efficient enhancement to existing DC pipelines, particularly when orthonormal secret bases are naturally feasible.</description>

Abstract: This note aims to provide a systematic investigation of direct data-driven control, enriching the existing literature not by adding another isolated result, but rather by offering a unifying, versatile, and broad framework that enables the generation of novel results in this domain. We formulate the nonlinear design problem from a high-level perspective as a set of desired controlled systems and propose systematic procedures to synthesize data-driven control algorithms that meet the specified design requirements. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach and its ability to derive new insights and results, illustrating the novel contributions enabled by the framework.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</description>

      <title>Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12756v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</description>

      <title>X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However, VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii) the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client). To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and locally independent inference.</description>
