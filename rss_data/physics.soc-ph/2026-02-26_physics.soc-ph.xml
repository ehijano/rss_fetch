      <title>Structurally Conditioned Diffusion Reproduces Skills-Based Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occupational hierarchies remain strikingly stable even as job content changes rapidly. We ask whether skill requirements propagate directionally along the wage hierarchy or follow symmetric diffusion. Using O*NET 2015-2024, we analyze 17.3 million directed diffusion opportunities linking 873 occupations and 161 skills. We show that propagation obeys an Asymmetric Trajectory Channeling (ATC) rule: the same requirement spreads differently upward and downward, and the asymmetry depends on skill domain and on the architecture of skill dependencies. Two mechanisms generate ATC. Directional incorporation asymmetry implies that wage gradients create distinct receiving environments: upward-moving socio-cognitive requirements encounter complementary infrastructure, whereas upward-moving sensory/physical requirements face structural indifference. Structural portability constraints imply that dependency position governs portability: requirements anchoring long prerequisite chains carry co-adoption burdens that restrict diffusion regardless of destination. Consistent with these mechanisms, socio-cognitive requirements propagate upward more often than downward (20.7% vs 14.9%), while sensory/physical requirements exhibit the mirror pattern (19.5% downward vs 10.3% upward). Nestedness amplifies these asymmetries in opposite directions: scaffolding capabilities ascend most readily, whereas structurally embedded physical requirements are most tightly confined. Identification leverages within-occupation variation in propagation direction, and results are robust to origin- and destination-side specifications. Together, these findings reveal a directional architecture of occupational change that can reproduce hierarchy through ongoing reconfiguration, even absent assortative preferences or coordinated action.</description>

      <title>Modeling plant disease spread via high-resolution human mobility networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mobility plays a crucial role in the spread of human diseases, but is rarely quantified in plant disease epidemics. To address this gap, we integrate a unique, high-resolution network of human movements in New Zealand with a metapopulation model to mechanistically simulate pathogen transmission. We calibrate the model on the nationwide 2010 kiwifruit vine disease (Psa-V) outbreak, and show that it accurately reproduces the observed spatiotemporal spread, confirming that the human mobility network is a strong foundation for modeling transmission dynamics. By analyzing spatial infection trends, we find that most dispersal occurs locally, as often illustrated in the plant-outbreak literature. However, sporadic long-range connections are necessary to model a nationwide outbreak. Using the model as an in-silico laboratory, we demonstrate that enhanced surveillance accelerates detection and that outbreak severity is highly sensitive to the timing and location of initial disease importation. We observe a potential causal link between seasonal labor patterns and epidemic risk in high-traffic seasons. This study provides a robust, data-driven framework for modeling and predicting the spatiotemporal spread of agricultural pathogens. It underscores the importance of leveraging human mobility networks to design timely interventions and surveillance systems, protecting global food security.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between nonlinear graph-based dynamics and linear dynamics on higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In network science, collective dynamics of complex systems are typically modelled as (nonlinear, often including many-body) vertex-level update rules evolving over a graph interaction structure. In recent years, frameworks that explicitly model such higher-order interactions in the interaction backbone (i.e. hypergraphs) have been advanced, somehow shifting the imputation of the effective nonlinearity from the dynamics to the interaction structure. In this short note we discuss such structural-dynamical representation duality, and investigate how and when a nonlinear dynamics defined on the vertex set of a graph allows an equivalent representation in terms of a linear dynamics defined on the state space of a sufficiently richer, higher-order interaction structure. We show that multilinear dynamics defined in the vertices of a graph admit an exact finite realizations as linear dynamics on the state space of a hypergraph. For other high-order interactions involving more general analytic nonlinearities, using Carleman linearization theory we discuss how that the required state space liftings necessary to linearize the dynamics cannot be accomodated to the simple structure of a hypergraph, and a richer combinatorial architecture such as a hb-graph is needed.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to out-of-sample network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks underpin systems that range from finance to biology, yet their structure is often only partially observed. Current reconstruction methods typically fit the parameters of a model anew to each snapshot, thus offering no guidance to predict future configurations. Here, we develop a Bayesian approach that uses the information about past network snapshots to inform a prior and predict the subsequent ones, while quantifying uncertainty. Instantiated with a single-parameter fitness model, our method infers link probabilities from node strengths and carries information forward in time. When applied to the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit across the years 1999-2012, our method accurately recovers the number of connections per bank at subsequent times, outperforming probabilistic benchmarks designed for analogous, link prediction tasks. Notably, each predicted snapshot serves as a reliable prior for the next one, thus enabling self-sustained, out-of-sample reconstruction of evolving networks with a minimal amount of additional data.</description>

      <title>The Swarm Intelligence Freeway-Urban Trajectories (SWIFTraj) Dataset - Part II: A Graph-Based Approach for Trajectory Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part I of this companion paper series, we introduced SWIFTraj, a new open-source vehicle trajectory dataset collected using a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. The dataset has two distinctive features. First, by connecting trajectories across consecutive UAV videos, it provides long-distance continuous trajectories, with the longest exceeding 4.5 km. Second, it covers an integrated traffic network consisting of both freeways and their connected urban roads. Obtaining such long-distance continuous trajectories from a UAV swarm is challenging, due to the need for accurate time alignment across multiple videos and the irregular spatial distribution of UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for connecting vehicle trajectories captured by a UAV swarm. An undirected graph is constructed to represent flexible UAV layouts, and an automatic time alignment method based on trajectory matching cost minimization is developed to estimate optimal time offsets across videos. To associate trajectories of the same vehicle observed in different videos, a vehicle matching table is established using the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated using both simulated and real-world data. Results from real-world experiments show that the time alignment error is within three video frames, corresponding to approximately 0.1 s, and that the vehicle matching achieves an F1-score of about 0.99. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing key challenges in UAV-based trajectory connection and highlight its potential for large-scale vehicle trajectory collection.</description>

      <title>Capacity drop accounting for microscopic vehicle interaction effects: analytical model and validation with high-resolution trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capacity drop is a traffic phenomenon in which the discharge flow from a queue is lower than the theoretical infrastructure capacity. This paper proposes a generic analytical method to estimate the queue discharge flow of freeway traffic. Capacity drop is primarily attributed to hesitant vehicles, defined as vehicles that stochastically and temporarily enter an acceleration delay state and generate voids (i.e., extra gaps) in front of them. The proposed method estimates the expected total void length generated by all hesitant vehicles, based on the distributions of their spatial and temporal locations as well as the associated delays. It also accounts for interactions between the waves triggered by downstream hesitant vehicles and the voids generated by upstream ones. Our analysis reveals that this interaction is the key mechanism behind the differing extents of capacity drop observed between standing queues and jam waves in previous studies. The accuracy of the model is validated through both numerical simulations and real-world trajectories. Overall, the proposed method offers a deeper understanding of capacity drop, which can be leveraged in traffic flow modeling and control.</description>

      <title>Academic collaborations and movements towards successful careers in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration networks evolve throughout academic careers, yet few studies systematically examine how these network dynamics relate to long-term career success and mobility. Analysing 35,708 physicists' careers spanning at least 15 years, we use time series clustering to identify ten distinct evolution patterns of network size and clustering coefficient across career years 5 to 15. We report three key results. First, authors who begin with loosely connected networks and progressively tighten their networks while expanding network size during mid-career achieve the highest PI attainment rates, publication output, and citation impact. Second, despite different starting points, network evolution patterns associated with better outcomes converge toward moderate clustering by career year 15, suggesting an optimal balance between core team cohesion and diverse external connections. Third, mobility is positively associated with these successful network evolution patterns and remains positively associated with scientific outcomes even after controlling for network evolution patterns.</description>

      <title>Selecting representative community partitions under modularity degeneracy: the STAR method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection based on modularity maximization is one of the most widely used approaches for uncovering mesoscale structures in complex networks. However, it is well known that the modularity function exhibits a highly degenerate optimization landscape: a large number of structurally distinct partitions attain close modularity values. This degeneracy raises issues of instability, reproducibility, and interpretability of the detected communities. We propose a simple and user-friendly post-processing method to address this problem by selecting a representative partition among the set of high-modularity solutions. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied a posteriori to the output of any modularity-based community detection algorithm. Rather than seeking the optimal partition in terms of modularity, our method aims to identify a solution that best represents the structural features shared across degenerate partitions. We compare our approach with consensus clustering methods, which pursue a similar objective, and show that the resulting partitions are highly consistent, while being obtained through a substantially simpler procedure that does not require additional optimization steps or external software packages. Moreover, unlike standard consensus clustering techniques, the proposed method can be applied to networks with both positive and negative edge weights, making it suitable for a wide range of applications involving signed networks and correlation-based systems, such as social, financial, and neuroscience networks. Overall, the method provides a practical and robust tool for handling degeneracy in modularity-based community detection, combining simplicity with broad applicability across different types of networks and real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Through Absence: How Comeback Researchers Bridge Knowledge Gaps Through Structural Re-emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the role of researchers who return to academia after prolonged inactivity, termed "comeback researchers", is crucial for developing inclusive models of scientific careers. This study investigates the structural and semantic behaviors of comeback researchers, focusing on their role in cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and network reintegration. Using the AMiner citation dataset, we analyze 113,637 early-career researchers and identify 1,425 comeback cases based on a three-year-or-longer publication gap followed by renewed activity. We find that comeback researchers cite 126% more distinct communities and exhibit 7.6% higher bridging scores compared to dropouts. They also demonstrate 74% higher gap entropy, reflecting more irregular yet strategically impactful publication trajectories. Predictive models trained on these bridging- and entropy-based features achieve a 97% ROC-AUC, far outperforming the 54% ROC-AUC of baseline models using traditional metrics like publication count and h-index. Finally, we substantiate these results via a multi-lens validation. These findings highlight the unique contributions of comeback researchers and offer data-driven tools for their early identification and institutional support.</description>

      <title>Robustness in sparse artificial neural networks trained with adaptive topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of sparse artificial neural networks trained with adaptive topology. We focus on a simple yet effective architecture consisting of three sparse layers with 99% sparsity followed by a dense layer, applied to image classification tasks such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST. By updating the topology of the sparse layers between each epoch, we achieve competitive accuracy despite the significantly reduced number of weights. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of the robustness of these networks, exploring their performance under various perturbations including random link removal, adversarial attack, and link weight shuffling. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that adaptive topology not only enhances efficiency but also maintains robustness. This work highlights the potential of adaptive sparse networks as a promising direction for developing efficient and reliable deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Complexity counts: global and local perspectives on Indo-Aryan numeral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numeral systems of Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, and Bengali are highly unusual in that unlike most numeral systems (e.g., those of English, Chinese, etc.), forms referring to 1--99 are highly non-transparent and are cannot be constructed using straightforward rules for forming combinations of tens and digits. As an example, Hindi/Urdu {\it iky\=anve} `91' is not decomposable into the composite elements {\it ek} `one' and {\it nave} `ninety' in the way that its English counterpart is. This paper further clarifies the position of Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of numeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that may be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages. Using data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a number of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity of languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have decisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole, though individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the complexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g., religion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral systems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why complex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages but not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems adhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found cross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat overlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing general variation in numeral systems.</description>
