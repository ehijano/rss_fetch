      <title>Combinatorics of descent algebras and graph coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a direct combinatorial proof that the product of two descent classes in a symmetric group is a sum of descent classes. The proof is based on the fact that the group product gives a covering map when descent classes are endowed with the graph structure coming from the weak order. The main geometric argument is valid for any Coxeter group, even infinite ones for which the descent algebra does not exist.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of non-monochromatic simplices for Sperner labelings of a regular triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attending to an open problem in the literature stated by Mirzakhani and Vondr\'ak, we give a lower bound of the number of non-monochromatic simplices for Sperner labelings of the vertices of a triangulation of a given $ k$-simplex with vertices of integer coordinates. This triangulation maximizes the number of simplices over all the triangulations of the $ k$-simplex with vertices of integer coordinates.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XIX. Bags of bounded domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph $H$ of large treewidth such that either $H$ is a subdivided wall or the line graph of a subdivided wall, or every induced subgraph of $H$ admits a tree decomposition where each bag induces a subgraph of small domination number. This is best possible as subdivided walls and their line graphs do not admit such tree decompositions.
  As a corollary, we deduce that if a graph $G$ has maximum degree at most $\Delta\in \mathbb{N}$ and no induced subgraph of large treewidth that is complete, complete bipartite, a subdivision of a large wall or the line graph of a subdivision of a large wall, then the treewidth of $G$ is bounded by a polynomial function of $\Delta$. This is an improvement of the breakthrough result of Korhonen that, under the same assumptions, gives an exponential bound in $\Delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent questions of Nathanson, we show that for any infinite abelian group $G$ and any integers $m_1, \ldots, m_H$, there exist finite subsets $A,B \subseteq G$ such that $|hA|-|hB|=m_h$ for each $1 \leq h \leq H$. We also raise, and begin to address, questions about the smallest possible cardinalities and diameters of such sets $A,B$.</description>

      <title>The overflow in the Katona Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n&gt;2r&gt;0$ be integers. We consider families $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of an $n$-element set, in which the union of any two members has size at most $2r$. One of our results states that for $n\geq 6r$ the number of members of size exceeding $r$ in $\mathcal{F}$ is at most $\binom{n-2}{r-1}$. Another result shows that for $n&gt;3.5r$ the number of sets of size at least $r$ is at most $\binom{n}{r}$. Both bounds are best possible and the latter sharpens the classical Katona Theorem. Similar results are proved for the odd case of the Katona Theorem as well.</description>

Abstract: We bound the number of permutations with a fixed number $r$ of $321$ patterns by a constant times the number of permutations which avoid $321$. We use this to show that the ordinary generating function for permutations with $r$ copies of $321$ patterns is not rational.</description>

      <title>Finite $s$-geodesic transitive graphs under certain girths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $s\geq1$ and a graph $\Gamma$, a path $(u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_{s})$ of vertices of $\Gamma$ is called an {\em $s$-geodesic} if it is a shortest path from $u_0$ to $u_{s}$. We say that $\Gamma$ is {\em $s$-geodesic transitive} if, for each $i\leq s$, $\Gamma$ has at least one $i$-geodesic, and its automorphism group is transitive on the set of $i$-geodesics. In 2021, Jin and Praeger [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 178 (2021) 105349] have studied $3$-geodesic transitive graphs of girth $5$ or $6$, and they also proposed to the problem that to classify $s$-geodesic transitive graphs of girth $2s-1$ or $2s-2$ for $s=4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. The case of $s = 4$ was investigated in [J. Algebra Combin. 60 (2024) 949--963]. In this paper, we study such graphs with $s\geq5$. More precisely, it is shown that a connected $(G,s)$-geodesic transitive graph $\Gamma$ with a nontrivial intransitive normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ which has at least $3$ orbits, where $G$ is an automorphism group of $\Gamma$ and $s\geq 5$, either $\Gamma$ is the Foster graph and $\Gamma_N$ is the Tutte's $8$-cage, or $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_N$ have the same girth and $\Gamma_N$ is $(G/N,s)$-geodesic transitive. Moreover, it is proved that if $G$ acts quasiprimitively on its vertex set, then $G$ is an almost simple group, and if $G$ acts biquasiprimitively, the stabilizer of biparts of $\Gamma$ in $G$ is an almost simple quasiprimitive group on each of biparts. In addition, $G$ cannot be primitive or biprimitive.</description>

      <title>Cubic graphs with no eigenvalues in the interval (-2,0)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterisation of the cubic graphs with no eigenvalues in the interval $(-2,0)$. There is one thin infinite family consisting of a single graph on $6n$ vertices for each $n \geqslant 2$, and five ``sporadic'' graphs, namely the $3$-prism $K_3 \mathbin{\square} K_2$, the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$, the Petersen graph, the dodecahedron and Tutte's $8$-cage. The proof starts by observing that if a cubic graph has no eigenvalues in $(-2,0)$ then its local structure around a girth-cycle is very constrained. Then a separate case analysis for each possible girth shows that these constraints can be satisfied only by the known examples. All but one of these case analyses can be completed by hand, but for girth five there are sufficiently many cases that it is necessary to use a computer for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Path operators and $(q,t)$-tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new class of operators that act on symmetric functions with two deformation parameters $q$ and $t$. Our combinatorial construction associates each operator with a specific lattice path, whose steps alternate between moving up and down. We demonstrate that positive linear combinations of these operators are the images of Negut elements via a representation of the shuffle algebra acting on the space of symmetric functions. Additionally, we provide a monomial, elementary, and Schur symmetric function expansion for the symmetric function obtained through repeated applications of the path operators on $1$.
  We apply path operators to investigate a $(q,t)$-deformation of the classical hypergeometric tau functions, which generalizes several important series already present in enumerative geometry, gauge theory, and integrability. We prove that this function is uniquely characterized by a family of partial differential equations derived from a positive linear combination of path operators. We also use our operators to offer a new, independent proof of the key result in establishing the extended delta conjecture of Haglund, Remmel, and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Enumerating planar stuffed maps as hypertrees of mobiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar stuffed map is an embedding of a graph into the 2-sphere $S^{2}$, considered up to orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, such that the complement of the graph is a collection of disjoint topologically connected components that are each homeomorphic to $S^{2}$ with multiple boundaries. This is a generalization of planar maps whose complement of the graph is a collection of disjoint topologically connected components that are each homeomorphic to a disc. In this work, we construct a bijection between certain bipartite planar stuffed maps and collections of integer-labelled trees connected by hyperedges such that they form a hypertree, called hypermobiles. This bijection directly generalizes the Bouttier-Di Franceso-Guitter bijection between bipartite planar maps and mobiles. We show that the generating functions of these trees of mobiles satisfy both an algebraic equation, generalizing the case of ordinary planar maps, and a new functional equation. As an example, we explicitly enumerate a class of stuffed quadrangulations.</description>

      <title>A construction that preserves the configuration of a matroid, with applications to lattice path matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration of a matroid $M$ is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats (flats that are unions of circuits) where we record the size and rank of each cyclic flat, but not the set. One can compute the Tutte polynomial of $M$, and stronger invariants (notably, the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant), from the configuration. Given a matroid $M$ in which certain pairs of cyclic flats are non-modular, we show how to produce a matroid that is not isomorphic to $M$ but has the same configuration as $M$. We show that this construction applies to a lattice path matroid if and only if it is not a fundamental transversal matroid, and we enumerate the connected lattice path matroids on $[n]$ that are fundamental; these results imply that, asymptotically, almost no lattice path matroids are Tutte unique. We give a sufficient condition for a matroid to be determined, up to isomorphism, by its configuration. We treat constructions that yield matroids with different configurations where each matroid is determined by its configuration and all have the same $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. We also show that for any lattice $L$ other than a chain, there are non-isomorphic transversal matroids that have the same configuration and where the lattices of cyclic flats are isomorphic to $L$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) graph is a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of the ABCD model, and its generalization to include outliers (ABCD+$o$), and introduce another variant that allows for overlapping communities, ABCD+$o^2$.</description>

Abstract: These are lecture notes supporting a minicourse taught at the Summer School in Total Positivity and Quantum Field Theory at CMSA Harvard in June 2025. We give an introduction to positive geometries and their canonical forms. We present the original definition by Arkani-Hamed, Bai and Lam, and a more recent definition suggested by work of Brown and Dupont. We compute canonical forms of convex polytopes and of quasi-regular polypols, which are nonlinear generalizations of polygons in the plane. The text is a collection of known results. It contains many examples and a list of exercises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suffixient sets are a novel combinatorial object that capture the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random-access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Ramanujan's formula for the sum of half-integer powers of consecutive integers via formal Bernoulli series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faulhaber's formula expresses the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, each raised to an integer power $p\geq 0$ as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. Ramanujan expressed this sum for $p\in\{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52,\frac72\}$ as the sum of a polynomial in $\sqrt{n}$ and a certain infinite series. In the present work, we explore the connection to Bernoulli polynomials, and by generalizing those to formal series, we extend the Ramanujan result to all positive half-integers $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the partition function $p(n)$, Ramanujan proved the striking identities $$
  P_5(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(5n+4)q^n =5\prod_{n\geq 1} \frac{\left(q^5;q^5\right)_{\infty}^5}{(q;q)_{\infty}^6}, $$ $$
  P_7(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(7n+5)q^n =7\prod_{n\geq 1}\frac{\left(q^7;q^7\right)_{\infty}^3}{(q;q)_{\infty}^4}+49q
  \prod_{n\geq 1}\frac{\left(q^7;q^7\right)_{\infty}^7}{(q;q)_{\infty}^8}, $$ where $(q;q)_{\infty}:=\prod_{n\geq 1}(1-q^n).$ As these identities imply his celebrated congruences modulo 5 and 7, it is natural to seek, for primes $\ell \geq 5,$ closed form expressions of the power series
  $$
  P_{\ell}(q):=\sum_{n\geq 0} p(\ell n-\delta_{\ell})q^n\pmod{\ell},
  $$
  where $\delta_{\ell}:=\frac{\ell^2-1}{24}.$ In this paper, we prove that

  P_{\ell}(q)\equiv c_{\ell} \frac{T_{\ell}(q)}{ (q^\ell; q^\ell )_\infty} \pmod{\ell},
  $$
  where $c_{\ell}\in \mathbb{Z}$ is explicit and $T_{\ell}(q)$ is the generating function for the Hecke traces of $\ell$-ramified values of special Dirichlet series for weight $\ell-1$ cusp forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This is a new proof of Ramanujan's congruences modulo 5, 7, and 11, as there are no nontrivial cusp forms of weight 4, 6, and 10.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of cluster maps of type $D_{2N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend one of the main results in \cite{hkm24}, of a deformed type $D_{4}$ map, to the general case of the type $D_{2N}$ for $N\geq3$. This can be achieved through a "local expansion" operation, introduced in the joint work \cite{grab} with Grabowski and Hone. This operation involves inserting a specific subquiver into the quiver arising from the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{4}$ map. This insertion yields a new quiver, obtained through the Laurentification of the deformed type $D_{6}$ map and thus enables systematic generalization to higher ranks $D_{2N}$. We further considered the degree growth of the deformed type $D_{2N}$ map via the tropical method and conjecture that for each $N$, the deformed map is an integrable map by applying an algebraic entropy test, the criterion for detecting integrability of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Characterising 4-tangles through a connectivity property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every large $k$-connected graph-minor induces a $k$-tangle in its ambient graph. The converse holds for $k\le 3$, but fails for $k\ge 4$. This raises the question whether `$k$-connected' can be relaxed to obtain a characterisation of $k$-tangles through highly cohesive graph-minors. We show that this can be achieved for $k=4$ by proving that internally 4-connected graphs have unique 4-tangles, and that every graph with a 4-tangle $\tau$ has an internally 4-connected minor whose unique 4-tangle lifts to $\tau$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit a procedure to asymptotically enumerate monotone grid classes of permutations. This is then applied to compute the asymptotic number of permutations in any connected one-corner class. Our strategy consists of enumerating the gridded permutations, finding the asymptotic distribution of points between the cells in a typical large gridded permutation, and analysing in detail the ways in which a typical permutation can be gridded. We also determine the limit shape of any connected monotone grid class.</description>

Abstract: We present outlines of a general method to reach certain kinds of $q$-multiple sum identities. Throughout our exposition, we shall give generalizations to the results given by Dilcher, Prodinger, Fu and Lascoux, Zeng, and Guo and Zhang concerning $q$-series identities related to divisor functions. Our exposition shall also provide a generalization of the duality relation for finite multiple harmonic $q$-series given by Bradley. Utilizing these generalizations, we will also arrive at some new interesting classes of $q$-multiple sums.</description>

      <title>From order one catalytic decompositions to context-free specifications: the rewiring bijection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Bousquet-M\'elou and Jehanne states that the bivariate power series solutions of so-called combinatorial polynomial equations with one catalytic variable, also known as catalytic equations, are algebraic series. We give a purely combinatorial derivation of this result in the case of order one catalytic equations (those involving only one univariate unknown series). In particular our approach provides a tool to produce context-free specifications, or bijections with simple multi-type families of trees, for the derivation trees of combinatorial structures that are directly governed by an order one catalytic decomposition.
  This provides a simple unified framework to deal with various combinatorial interpretation problems that were solved or raised over the last 50 years since the first such catalytic equation was written by W. T. Tutte in the late 60's to enumerate rooted planar maps.</description>

Abstract: We consider the number of common edges in two independent random spanning trees of a graph $G$. For complete graphs $K_n$, we give a new proof of the fact, originally obtained by Moon, that the distribution converges to a Poisson distribution with expected value $2$. This is applied to show a Poisson limit law for the number of common edges in two independent random spanning trees of an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for constant~$p$. We also use the same method to prove an analogous result for complete multipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the GKM theoretical counterpart of the equivariant complex vector bundles as the "leg bundle". We also provide a definition for the projectivization of a leg bundle and prove the Borel-Hirzebruch type formula for its graph equivariant cohomology, assuming that the projectivization is again a GKM graph. Furthermore, we study the realization of the projective GKM fiber bundle, in the sense of Guillemin-Sabatini-Zara, can be obtained from the projectivization of a leg bundle.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of skew lines in $\mathbb P^3$ with an application to algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a previously unrecognized combinatorial structure underlying configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3$, and reveals its deep and surprising connection to the algebro-geometric concept of geproci sets.
  Given any field $\mathbb{K}$ and a finite set $\mathcal L$ of 3 or more skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$, we associate to it a group $G_{\mathcal L}$ and a groupoid $C_{\mathcal L}$ whose action on the union $\cup_{L\in\mathcal L}L$ provides orbits which have a rich combinatorial structure. We characterize when $G_{\mathcal L}$ is abelian and give partial results on its finiteness. The notion of \emph{collinearly complete} subsets is introduced and shown to correspond exactly to unions of groupoid orbits. In the case where $\mathbb{K}$ is a finite field and $\mathcal L$ is a full spread in $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ (i.e., every point of $\mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ lies on a line in $\mathcal{L}$), we prove that $G_{\mathcal L}$ being abelian characterizes the classical spread given by the fibers of the Hopf fibration. Over any algebraically closed field, we establish that finite unions of $C_{\mathcal L}$-orbits are geproci sets - that is, finite sets whose general projections to a plane are complete intersections. Furthermore, we prove a converse: if $\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed and $Z \subset \mathbb{P}^3_\mathbb{K}$ is a geproci set consisting of $m$ points on each of $s \geq 3$ skew lines $\mathcal L$ where the general projection of $Z$ is a complete intersection of type $(m, s)$, then $Z$ is a finite union of orbits of $C_{\mathcal L}$.
  This work thus uncovers a profound combinatorial framework governing geproci sets, providing a new bridge between incidence combinatorics and algebraic geometry.</description>

Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of finite subsets $s$ of the natural numbers such that $|s|=1+\min s$ is known as the Schreier barrier in combinatorics and Banach Space theory, and as the family of exactly $\omega$-large sets in Logic. We formulate and prove the generalizations of Friedman's Free Set and Thin Set theorems and of Rainbow Ramsey's theorem to colorings of the Schreier barrier. We analyze the strength of these theorems from the point of view of Computability Theory and Reverse Mathematics. Surprisingly, the exactly $\omega$-large counterparts of the Thin Set and Free Set theorems can code $\emptyset^{(\omega)}$, while the exactly $\omega$-large Rainbow Ramsey theorem does not code the halting set.</description>

      <title>A Proof of The Changepoint Detection Threshold Conjecture in Preferential Attachment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of detecting and estimating a changepoint in the attachment function of a network evolving according to a preferential attachment model on $n$ vertices, using only a single final snapshot of the network. Bet et al.~\cite{bet2023detecting} show that a simple test based on thresholding the number of vertices with minimum degrees can detect the changepoint when the change occurs at time $n-\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. They further make the striking conjecture that detection becomes impossible for any test if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Kaddouri et al.~\cite{kaddouri2024impossibility} make a step forward by proving the detection is impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(n^{1/3}).$ In this paper, we resolve the conjecture affirmatively, proving that detection is indeed impossible if the change occurs at time $n-o(\sqrt{n}).$ Furthermore, we establish that estimating the changepoint with an error smaller than $o(\sqrt{n})$ is also impossible, thereby confirming that the estimator proposed in Bhamidi et al.~\cite{bhamidi2018change} is order-optimal.</description>

      <title>Stochastic domination and lifts of random variables in percolation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider some matrix waiting for its coefficients to be written. For each column, sample independently one Bernoulli random variable of some parameter $p$. Seeing all this and possibly using extra randomness, Alice then chooses one spot in each column, in any way she wants. When the Bernoulli random variable of some column is equal to 1, the number 1 is written in the chosen spot. When the Bernoulli random variable of a column is 0, nothing is done on this column. We prove that, using extra randomness, it is possible for Bob to fill the empty spots with well chosen 0's and 1's so that the entries of the matrix are independent Bernoulli random variables of parameter $p$. We investigate various generalisations and variations of this problem, and use this result to revisit and generalise (nonstrict) monotonicity of the percolation threshold $p_c$ with respect to some sort of graph-quotienting, namely fibrations.
  In a second part, which is independent of the first one, we revisit strict monotonicity of $p_c$ with respect to fibrations, a result that naturally requires more assumptions than its nonstrict counterpart. We reprove the bond-percolation case of the result of Martineau and Severo without resorting to essential enhancements, using couplings instead.</description>
