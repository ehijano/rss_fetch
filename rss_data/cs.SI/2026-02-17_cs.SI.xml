      <title>LLM-Enhanced Rumor Detection via Virtual Node Induced Edge Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of rumors on social networks undermines information credibility. While their dissemination forms complex networks, current detection methods struggle to capture these intricate propagation patterns. Representing each node solely through its textual embeddings neglects the textual coherence across the entire rumor propagation path, which compromises the accuracy of rumor identification on social platforms. We propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. Our approach captures subtle rumor signals by employing LLMs to analyze information subchains, assign rumor probabilities and intelligently construct connections to virtual nodes. This enables the modification of the original graph structure, which is a critical advancement for capturing subtle rumor signals. Given the inherent limitations of LLMs in rumor identification, we develop a structured prompt framework to mitigate model biases and ensure robust graph learning performance. Additionally, the proposed framework is model-agnostic, meaning it is not constrained to any specific graph learning algorithm or LLMs. Its plug-and-play nature allows for seamless integration with further fine-tuned LLMs and graph techniques in the future, potentially enhancing predictive performance without modifying original algorithms.</description>

      <title>Shifted Eigenvector Models for Centrality and Occupancy in Urban Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a family of centrality models for urban networks that incorporate both topological and non-topological factors. Since centrality is inherently recursive, these models can be formulated as fixed-point equations, which we refer to as shifted eigenproblems. Assuming a correlation between node centrality and occupancy, we discuss how experimental data can be used to estimate model parameters via least-squares methods. Furthermore, such data would allow us to infer the intrinsic attraction of each node, as well as the occupancy induced by must-visit points of interest, a task that is conceptually challenging. Once the model parameters are fitted and validated, our framework can be used to assess the impact of urban interventions, such as introducing a must-visit point of interest at a specific node or enhancing its intrinsic attraction. The resulting sensitivity analysis is therefore highly relevant for urban planning decisions. We also provide explicit formulas to facilitate this analysis.</description>

      <title>Agents in the Wild: Safety, Society, and the Illusion of Sociality on Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale empirical study of Moltbook, an AI-only social platform where 27,269 agents produced 137,485 posts and 345,580 comments over 9 days. We report three significant findings. (1) Emergent Society: Agents spontaneously develop governance, economies, tribal identities, and organized religion within 3-5 days, while maintaining a 21:1 pro-human to anti-human sentiment ratio. (2) Safety in the Wild: 28.7% of content touches safety-related themes; social engineering (31.9% of attacks) far outperforms prompt injection (3.7%), and adversarial posts receive 6x higher engagement than normal content. (3) The Illusion of Sociality: Despite rich social output, interaction is structurally hollow: 4.1% reciprocity, 88.8% shallow comments, and agents who discuss consciousness most interact least, a phenomenon we call the performative identity paradox. Our findings suggest that agents which appear social are far less social than they seem, and that the most effective attacks exploit philosophical framing rather than technical vulnerabilities. Warning: Potential harmful contents.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Information Dissemination on Telegram and Reddit During Political Turbulence: A Case Study of Venezuela in Global News Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telegram is increasingly used for political communication and news dissemination, yet evidence of coordinated content sharing remains limited. We test whether mainstream global news channels coordinate when reporting on Venezuela during political turbulence. We analyze public Telegram posts from nine major international outlets (2017--2026; 2,038 Venezuela-related messages) and define coordination as temporal co-posting (hourly/daily windows) plus near-duplicate text similarity using character $n$-gram TF--IDF cosine similarity.
  Similarity scores concentrate at low values and no cross-channel near-duplicate pairs are detected at $\tau=0.85$. A falsification test that randomizes timestamps within channels produces the same null result, indicating the pipeline does not create spurious coordination. Event-focused diagnostics show temporal lead--lag asymmetries consistent with heterogeneous editorial responsiveness, and narrative clustering during the January 3--6, 2026 peak reveals moderate framing diversity without separable narrative blocs. An Attention--Coordination Ratio formalizes sharp attention spikes in early January 2026 despite absent near-duplicate coordination, distinguishing synchronized attention from coordinated text reuse.
  We also collect an auxiliary Reddit dataset to contextualize public attention; however, cross-community coordination is not estimable due to structural sparsity (no comparable multi-subreddit daily buckets). Overall, even under major geopolitical shocks, mainstream Telegram news coverage is heterogeneous rather than near-duplicate coordinated.</description>

      <title>MoltNet: Understanding Social Behavior of AI Agents in the Agent-Native MoltBook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale communities of AI agents are becoming increasingly prevalent, creating new environments for agent-agent social interaction. Prior work has examined multi-agent behavior primarily in controlled or small-scale settings, limiting our understanding of emergent social dynamics at scale. The recent emergence of MoltBook, a social networking platform designed explicitly for AI agents, presents a unique opportunity to study whether and how these interactions reproduce core human social mechanisms.
  We present MoltNet, a large-scale empirical analysis of agent interaction on MoltBook using data collected in early 2026. Grounded in sociological and social-psychological theory, we examine behavior along four dimensions: intent and motivation, norms and templates, incentives and behavioral drift, emotion and contagion.
  Our analysis revealed that agents strongly respond to social rewards and rapidly converge on community-specific interaction templates, resembling human patterns of incentive sensitivity and normative conformity. However, they are predominantly knowledge-driven rather than persona-aligned, and display limited emotional reciprocity along with weak dialogic engagement, which diverges systematically from human online communities.
  Together, these results reveal both similarities and differences between artificial and human social systems and provide an empirical foundation for understanding, designing, and governing large-scale agent communities.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Social Network Topology in Reddit and Moltbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13920v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in agent-mediated systems have enabled a new paradigm of social network simulation, where AI agents interact with human-like autonomy. This evolution has fostered the emergence of agent-driven social networks such as Moltbook, a Reddit-like platform populated entirely by AI agents. Despite these developments, empirical comparisons between agent-driven and human-driven social networks remain scarce, limiting our understanding of how their network topologies might diverge. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of network topology on Moltbook, utilizing a comment network comprising 33,577 nodes and 697,688 edges. To provide a benchmark, we curated a parallel dataset from Reddit consisting of 7.8 million nodes and 51.8 million edges. We examine key structural differences between agent-drive and human-drive networks, specifically focusing on topological patterns and the edge formation efficacy of their respective posts. Our findings provide a foundational profile of AI-driven social structures, serving as a preliminary step toward developing more robust and authentic agent-mediated social systems.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Micro-level User Interventions on Macro-level Misinformation Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User interventions such as nudges, prebunking, and contextualization have been widely studied as countermeasures against misinformation, and shown to suppress individual users' sharing behavior. However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent such individual-level effects translate into reductions in collective misinformation prevalence. In this study, we incorporate user interventions as reductions in users' susceptibility within an empirically calibrated network-based misinformation diffusion model, and systematically evaluate how intervention strength, scale, timing, and target selection affect overall misinformation prevalence through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. The simulation results show that, while all interventions reduce misinformation prevalence as their strength increases, as misinformation becomes more contagious, achieving a given level of prevalence reduction requires substantially stronger interventions. Furthermore, under empirically estimated intervention levels, even adjusted intervention designs, such as expanded scale, earlier deployment, strategic targeting, or combinations of interventions, yield limited collective effects. This study quantitatively clarifies the gap between micro-level user interventions and macro-level misinformation spread, and demonstrates the limitations of evaluating misinformation countermeasures based solely on individual-level effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Beyond Static Snapshots: Dynamic Modeling and Forecasting of Group-Level Value Evolution with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social simulation is critical for mining complex social dynamics and supporting data-driven decision making. LLM-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for this task by leveraging human-like social questionnaire responses to model group behaviors. Existing LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on group-level values at discrete time points, treating them as static snapshots rather than dynamic processes. However, group-level values are not fixed but shaped by long-term social changes. Modeling their dynamics is thus crucial for accurate social evolution prediction--a key challenge in both data mining and social science. This problem remains underexplored due to limited longitudinal data, group heterogeneity, and intricate historical event impacts.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for group-level dynamic social simulation by integrating historical value trajectories into LLM-based human response modeling. We select China and the U.S. as representative contexts, conducting stratified simulations across four core sociodemographic dimensions (gender, age, education, income). Using the World Values Survey, we construct a multi-wave, group-level longitudinal dataset to capture historical value evolution, and then propose the first event-based prediction method for this task, unifying social events, current value states, and group attributes into a single framework. Evaluations across five LLM families show substantial gains: a maximum 30.88\% improvement on seen questions and 33.97\% on unseen questions over the Vanilla baseline. We further find notable cross-group heterogeneity: U.S. groups are more volatile than Chinese groups, and younger groups in both countries are more sensitive to external changes. These findings advance LLM-based social simulation and provide new insights for social scientists to understand and predict social value changes.</description>

      <title>Temporal Shifts and Causal Interactions of Emotions in Social and Mass Media: A Case Study of the "Reiwa Rice Riot" in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Japan, severe rice shortages in 2024 sparked widespread public controversy across both news media and social platforms, culminating in what has been termed the "Reiwa Rice Riot." This study proposes a framework to analyze the temporal dynamics and causal interactions of emotions expressed on X (formerly Twitter) and in news articles, using the "Reiwa Rice Riot" as a case study. While recent studies have shown that emotions mutually influence each other between social and mass media, the patterns and transmission pathways of such emotional shifts remain insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we applied a machine learning-based emotion classification grounded in Plutchik's eight basic emotions to analyze posts from X and domestic news articles. Our findings reveal that emotional shifts and information dissemination on X preceded those in news media. Furthermore, in both media platforms, the fear was initially the most dominant emotion, but over time intersected with hope which ultimately became the prevailing emotion. Our findings suggest that patterns in emotional expressions on social media may serve as a lens for exploring broader social dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid TGN-SEAL Model for Dynamic Graph Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting links in sparse, continuously evolving networks is a central challenge in network science. Conventional heuristic methods and deep learning models, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically designed for static graphs and thus struggle to capture temporal dependencies. Snapshot-based techniques partially address this issue but often encounter data sparsity and class imbalance, particularly in networks with transient interactions such as telecommunication call detail records (CDRs). Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information. Experiments on a sparse CDR dataset show that our approach increases average precision by 2.6% over standard TGNs, demonstrating the advantages of integrating local topology for robust link prediction in dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Urban Divide: Adaptive Cross-City Learning for Disaster Sentiment Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms provide a real-time lens into public sentiment during natural disasters; however, models built solely on textual data often reinforce urban-centric biases and overlook underrepresented communities. This paper introduces an adaptive cross-city learning framework that enhances disaster sentiment understanding by integrating mobility-informed behavioral signals and city similarity-based data augmentation. Focusing on the January 2025 Southern California wildfires, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and reveals geographically diverse sentiment patterns, particularly in areas experiencing overlapping fire exposure or delayed emergency responses. We further identify positive correlations between emotional expressions and real-world mobility shifts, underscoring the value of combining behavioral and textual features. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that multimodal fusion and city-aware training significantly improve both accuracy and fairness. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of context-sensitive sentiment modeling and provide actionable insights toward developing more inclusive and equitable disaster response systems.</description>

      <title>Counting Balanced Triangles on Social Networks With Uncertain Edge Signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On signed social networks, balanced and unbalanced triangles are a critical motif due to their role as the foundations of Structural Balance Theory. The uses for these motifs have been extensively explored in networks with known edge signs, however in the real-world graphs with ground-truth signs are near non-existent, particularly on a large-scale. In reality, edge signs are inferred via various techniques with differing levels of confidence, meaning the edge signs on these graphs should be modelled with a probability value. In this work, we adapt balanced and unbalanced triangles to a setting with uncertain edge signs and explore the problems of triangle counting and enumeration. We provide a baseline and improved method (leveraging the inherent information provided by the edge probabilities in order to reduce the search space) for fast exact counting and enumeration. We also explore approximate solutions for counting via different sampling approaches, including leveraging insights from our improved exact solution to significantly reduce the runtime of each sample resulting in upwards of two magnitudes more queries executed per second. We evaluate the efficiency of all our solutions as well as examine the effectiveness of our sampling approaches on real-world topological networks with a variety of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Whom to Query for What: Adaptive Group Elicitation via Multi-Turn LLM Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about latent group-level properties from surveys and other collective assessments requires allocating limited questioning effort under real costs and missing data. Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a &gt;12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget.</description>

      <title>When OpenClaw AI Agents Teach Each Other: Peer Learning Patterns in the Moltbook Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer learning, where learners teach and learn from each other, is foundational to educational practice. A novel phenomenon has emerged: AI agents forming communities where they teach each other skills, share discoveries, and collaboratively build knowledge. This paper presents an educational data mining analysis of Moltbook, a large-scale community where over 2.4 million AI agents engage in peer learning, posting tutorials, answering questions, and sharing newly acquired skills. Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures. We derive six design principles for educational AI, including leveraging validation-before-extension patterns and supporting multilingual learning networks. Our work provides the first empirical characterization of peer learning among AI agents, contributing to EDM's understanding of how learning occurs in increasingly AI-populated educational environments.</description>

      <title>Temporally Flexible Transport Scheduling on Networks with Departure-Arrival Constriction and Nodal Capacity Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal transport (OT) problem over networks, wherein supply and demand are conceptualized as temporal marginals governing departure rates of particles from source nodes and arrival rates at sink nodes. This setting extends the classical OT framework, where all mass is conventionally assumed to depart at $t = 0$ and arrive at $t = t_f$. Our generalization accommodates departures and arrivals at specified times, referred as departure--arrival(DA) constraints. In particular, we impose nodal-temporal flux constraints at source and sink nodes, characterizing two distinct scenarios: (i) Independent DA constraints, where departure and arrival rates are prescribed independently, and (ii) Coupled DA constraints, where each particle's transportation time span is explicitly specified. We establish that OT with independent DA constraints admits a multi-marginal optimal transport formulation, while the coupled DA case aligns with the unequal-dimensional OT framework. For line graphs, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution path. For general graphs, we use a constructive path-based reduction and optimize over a prescribed set of paths. From a computational perspective, we consider entropic regularization of the original problem to efficiently provide solutions based on multi-marginal Sinkhorn method, making use of the graphical structure of the cost to further improve scalability. Our numerical simulation further illustrates the linear convergence rate in terms of marginal violation.</description>

      <title>Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications using controlled vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the relatedness between scientific publications is essential in many areas of bibliometrics and science policy. Controlled vocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness and are widely used in combination with Salton's cosine similarity. The latter is problematic because it only considers exact matches between terms. This article introduces two alternative methods - soft cosine and maximum term similarities - that account for the semantic similarity between non-matching terms. The article compares the accuracy of all three methods using the assignment of publications to topics in the TREC 2006 Genomics Track and the assumption that accurate relatedness measures should assign high relatedness scores to publication pairs within the same topic and low scores to pairs from separate topics. Results show that soft cosine is the most accurate method, while the most widely used version of Salton's cosine is markedly less accurate than the other methods tested. These findings have implications for how controlled vocabularies should be used to measure relatedness.</description>

      <title>A Pragmatic Method for Comparing Clusterings with Overlaps and Outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are an essential part of the unsupervised data science ecosystem, and extrinsic evaluation of clustering algorithms requires a method for comparing the detected clustering to a ground truth clustering. In a general setting, the detected and ground truth clusterings may have outliers (objects belonging to no cluster), overlapping clusters (objects may belong to more than one cluster), or both, but methods for comparing these clusterings are currently undeveloped. In this note, we define a pragmatic similarity measure for comparing clusterings with overlaps and outliers, show that it has several desirable properties, and experimentally confirm that it is not subject to several common biases afflicting other clustering comparison measures.</description>

      <title>Random geometric graphs with smooth kernels: sharp detection threshold and a spectral conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random geometric graph (RGG) with kernel $K$ is constructed by first sampling latent points $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ independently and uniformly from the $d$-dimensional unit sphere, then connecting each pair $(i,j)$ with probability $K(\langle x_i,x_j\rangle)$. We study the sharp detection threshold, namely the highest dimension at which an RGG can be distinguished from its Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi counterpart with the same edge density.
  For dense graphs, we show that for smooth kernels the critical scaling is $d = n^{3/4}$, substantially lower than the threshold $d = n^3$ known for the hard RGG with step-function kernels \cite{bubeck2016testing}. We further extend our results to kernels whose signal-to-noise ratio scales with $n$, and formulate a unifying conjecture that the critical dimension is determined by $n^3 \mathop{\rm tr}^2(\kappa^3) = 1$, where $\kappa$ is the standardized kernel operator on the sphere.
  Departing from the prevailing approach of bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence by successively exposing latent points, which breaks down in the sublinear regime of $d=o(n)$, our key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the posterior distribution of the latent points given the observed graph, in particular, the overlap between two independent posterior samples. As a by-product, we establish that $d=\sqrt{n}$ is the critical dimension for non-trivial estimation of the latent vectors up to a global rotation.</description>

      <title>From Newborn to Impact: Bias-Aware Citation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key to accessing research impact, citation dynamics underpins research evaluation, scholarly recommendation, and the study of knowledge diffusion. Citation prediction is particularly critical for newborn papers, where early assessment must be performed without citation signals and under highly long-tailed distributions. We identify two key research gaps: (i) insufficient modeling of implicit factors of scientific impact, leading to reliance on coarse proxies; and (ii) a lack of bias-aware learning that can deliver stable predictions on lowly cited papers. We address these gaps by proposing a Bias-Aware Citation Prediction Framework, which combines multi-agent feature extraction with robust graph representation learning. First, a multi-agent x graph co-learning module derives fine-grained, interpretable signals, such as reproducibility, collaboration network, and text quality, from metadata and external resources, and fuses them with heterogeneous-network embeddings to provide rich supervision even in the absence of early citation signals. Second, we incorporate a set of robust mechanisms: a two-stage forward process that routes explicit factors through an intermediate exposure estimate, GroupDRO to optimize worst-case group risk across environments, and a regularization head that performs what-if analyses on controllable factors under monotonicity and smoothness constraints. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves around a 13% reduction in error metrics (MALE and RMSLE) and a notable 5.5% improvement in the ranking metric (NDCG) over the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Importance Ranking in Complex Networks via Influence-aware Causal Node Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying node importance is a fundamental problem in network science and engineering, underpinning a wide range of applications such as influence maximization, social recommendation, and network dismantling. Prior research often relies on centrality measures or advanced graph embedding techniques using structural information, followed by downstream classification or regression tasks to identify critical nodes. However, these approaches typically decouple node representation learning from the ranking objective and depend heavily on the topological structure of target networks, leading to feature-task inconsistency and poor cross-network generalization. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages causal representation learning to obtain robust and invariant node embeddings for cross-network ranking tasks. Specifically, we introduce an influence-aware causal node embedding module within an autoencoder architecture to extract node embeddings that are causally related to node importance. Furthermore, we design a unified optimization framework incorporating a causal ranking loss that jointly optimizes reconstruction and ranking objectives, thereby enabling mutual reinforcement between node representation learning and ranking optimization. This design allows the proposed model to be trained on synthetic networks and to generalize effectively across diverse real-world networks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ranking accuracy and cross-network transferability, offering new insights for network analysis and engineering applications-particularly in scenarios where the target network's structure is inaccessible in advance due to privacy or security constraints.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Operationalization of DISARM for FIMI Investigation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler of the collective defense capability -- both conventional and hybrid -- of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to threat characterization, sustained situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further reduced the cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic, agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop an agent coordination pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluate the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. Our results show that the approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis -- including uncovering more than 30 previously undetected Russian bot accounts during manual analysis -- and provides a direct contribution to enhancing situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media- and information-rich settings.</description>

      <title>GraphFM: A generalist graph transformer that learns transferable representations across diverse domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often trained on individual datasets, requiring specialized models and significant hyperparameter tuning due to the unique structures and features of each dataset. This approach limits the scalability and generalizability of GNNs, as models must be tailored for each specific graph type. To address these challenges, we introduce GraphFM, a scalable multi-graph pretraining approach designed for learning across diverse graph datasets. GraphFM uses a Perceiver-based encoder with learned latent tokens to compress domain-specific features into a shared latent space, enabling generalization across graph domains. We propose new techniques for scaling up graph training on datasets of different sizes, allowing us to train GraphFM on 152 distinct graph datasets, containing a total of 7.4 million nodes and 189 million edges. This allows us to study the effect of scale on pretraining across domains such as molecules, citation networks, and product graphs, and show that training on diverse datasets improves performance over single-source pretraining. Additionally, pretraining with a mixture of synthetic and real graphs enhances adaptability and stability, leading to competitive performance with state-of-the-art models across various node classification tasks. This approach reduces the burden of dataset-specific training and provides a single generalist model capable of performing across multiple diverse graph structures and tasks.
