      <title>Automatic Identification of Magnetospheric Regions using Supervised Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated approach for identifying magnetospheric regions using supervised machine learning techniques applied to Magnetospheric MultiScale mission data. Our method utilizes ion energy spectra, total magnetic field, total ion temperature, and spacecraft position data to classify five distinct plasma environments: solar wind, magnetosheath, inner magnetosphere, plasma sheet, and lobe regions. The approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for analyzing ion energy spectrogram data with a Random Forest classifier for scalar plasma parameters. The CNN method employs 2D convolution to identify spatial and temporal patterns in the ion energy spectrogram treated as image-like data, while the Random Forest model processes averaged magnetic field, temperature, and position parameters. Our hybrid model achieves 99% accuracy on test dataset with an F1 score of 0.99, providing reliable automated region identification at 3-minute temporal resolution. This lightweight approach requires minimal manual data labeling and can be readily applied to other magnetospheric missions with similar data products.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>A Multispacecraft Analysis and Modeling of Type III Radio Burst Exciter Deceleration in Inhomogeneous Heliospheric Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</description>
