      <title>Koopman Model Dimension Reduction via Variational Bayesian Inference and Graph Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator recently gained increasing attention in the control systems community for its abilities to bridge linear and nonlinear systems. Data driven Koopman operator approximations have established themselves as key enablers for system identification and model predictive control. Nonetheless, such methods commonly entail a preselected definition of states in the function space leading to high dimensional overfitting models and degraded long term prediction performances. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical probabilistic approach for the Koopman model identification problem. In our method, elements of the model are treated as random variables and the posterior estimates are found using variational Bayesian (VB) inference updates. Our model distinguishes from others in the integration of inclusion flags. By the help of the inclusion flags, we intuitively threshold the probability of each state in the model. We then propose a graph search based algorithm to reduce the preselected states of the Koopman model. We demonstrate that our reduction method overcomes numerical instabilities and the reduced models maintain performance in simulated and real experiments.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling and Sensor/Actuator Placement Framework for Flexible Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible spacecraft structures present significant challenges for physical and control system design due to nonlinear dynamics, mission constraints, environmental variables, and changing operational conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for constructing reduced-order surrogate models of a flexible spacecraft using the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), followed by optimal sensor/actuator pair placement. Highfidelity simulation data from a nonlinear flexible spacecraft model, including coupled rigid-body and elastic modes, are captured by defining a mesh of nodes over the spacecraft body. The data-driven methods are then used to construct a modal model from the time histories of these node points. Optimal sensor/actuator placement for controllability and observability is performed via a nonlinear programming technique that maximizes the singular values of the Hankel matrix. Finally, the sensor placement and dynamics modeling approach is iterated to account for changes in the dynamic system introduced by sensor/actuator physical mass. The proposed methodology enables initialization of physical modeling without requiring a direct analytical model and provides a practical solution for onboard implementation in model-based control and estimation systems. Results demonstrate optimal design methodology with substantial model-order reduction while preserving dynamic fidelity, and provide insight into effective sensor-actuator configurations for estimation and control.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning based Control Design for Aircraft Recovery from Loss-of-Control Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss-of-control (LOC) remains a leading cause of fixed-wing aircraft accidents, especially in post-stall and flat-spin regimes where conventional gain-scheduled or logic-based recovery laws may fail. This study formulates spin-recovery as a continuous-state, continuous-action Markov Decision Process and trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent on a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom F-18/HARV model that includes nonlinear aerodynamics, actuator saturation and rate coupling. A two-phase potential-based reward structure first penalizes large angular rates and then enforces trimmed flight. After 6,000 simulated episodes, the policy generalities to unseen upset initializations. Results show that the learned policy successfully arrests the angular rates and stabilizes the angle of attack. The controller performance is observed to be satisfactory for recovery from spin condition which was compared with a state-of-the-art sliding mode controller. The findings demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning can deliver interpretable, dynamically feasible manoeuvres for real-time loss of control mitigation and provide a pathway for flight-critical RL deployment.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LSTM-UKF Framework: Ankle Angle and Ground Reaction Force Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of joint kinematics and kinetics is essential for advancing gait analysis and developing intelligent assistive systems such as prosthetics and exoskeletons. This study presents a hybrid LSTM-UKF framework for estimating ankle angle and ground reaction force (GRF) across varying walking speeds. A multimodal sensor fusion strategy integrates force plate data, knee angle, and GRF signals to enrich biomechanical context. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE and $R^2$ under subject-specific validation. The LSTM-UKF consistently outperformed standalone LSTM and UKF models, achieving up to 18.6\% lower RMSE for GRF prediction at 3 km/h. Additionally, UKF integration improved robustness, reducing ankle angle RMSE by up to 22.4\% compared to UKF alone at 1 km/h. These results underscore the effectiveness of hybrid architectures for reliable gait prediction across subjects and walking conditions.</description>

      <title>Coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Control of Point Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8% and 21.5%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPU-accelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid-structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Weighted Median Opinion Dynamics with Higher-Order Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted median mechanism provides a robust alternative to weighted averaging in opinion dynamics. Existing models, however, are predominantly formulated on pairwise interaction graphs, which limits their ability to represent higher-order environmental effects. In this work, a generalized weighted median opinion dynamics model is proposed by incorporating high-order interactions through a simplicial complex representation. The resulting dynamics are formulated as a nonlinear discrete-time system with synchronous opinion updates, in which intrinsic agent interactions and external environmental influences are jointly modeled. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic consensus are established for heterogeneous systems composed of opinionated and unopinionated agents. For homogeneous opinionated systems, convergence and convergence rates are rigorously analyzed using the Banach fixed-point theorem. Theoretical results demonstrate the stability of the proposed dynamics under mild conditions, and numerical simulations are provided to corroborate the analysis. This work extends median-based opinion dynamics to high-order interaction settings and provides a system-level framework for stability and consensus analysis.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Dual-Buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODASER) for Safe Reinforcement Learning in Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, named Self-Organizing Dual-buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODACER), designed to achieve safe and scalable optimal control of nonlinear systems. The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test.</description>

      <title>Modeling Descriptive Norms in Multi-Agent Systems: An Auto-Aggregation PDE Framework with Adaptive Perception Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a PDE-based auto-aggregation model for simulating descriptive norm dynamics in autonomous multi-agent systems, capturing convergence and violation through non-local perception kernels and external potential fields. Extending classical transport equations, the framework represents opinion popularity as a continuous distribution, enabling direct interactions without Bayesian guessing of beliefs. Applied to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from a major medical center, the experimental results demonstrate that: when clinical guidelines serve as a top-down constraint mechanism, it effectively generates convergence of novel descriptive norms consistent with the dataset; in the bottom-up experiment, potential field guidance successfully promotes the system's reconstruction of descriptive norms aligned with the dataset through violation-and-recoupling; whereas fully autonomous interaction leads to the emergence of multi-centric normative structures independent of the dataset.</description>

      <title>Robustness Quantification of MIMO-PI Controller From the Perspective of \(\gamma\)-Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and its variants are widely used in control engineering, but they often rely on linearization around equilibrium points and empirical parameter tuning, making them ineffective for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems with strong coupling, intense external disturbances, and high nonlinearity. Moreover, existing methods rarely explore the intrinsic stabilization mechanism of PID controllers for disturbed nonlinear systems from the perspective of modern robust control theories such as dissipativity and $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain. To address this gap, this study focuses on $\gamma$-dissipativity (partially equivalent to $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain) and investigates the optimal parameter tuning of MIMO-PI controllers for general disturbed nonlinear MIMO systems. First, by integrating dissipativity theory with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) inequality, sufficient conditions for the MIMO-PI-controlled system to achieve $\gamma$-dissipativity are established, and the degree of $\gamma$-dissipativity in a local region containing the origin is quantified. Second, an optimal parameter tuning strategy is proposed, which reformulates the $\gamma$-dissipativity optimization problem into a class of standard eigenvalue problems (EVPs) and further converts it into linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations for efficient online computation. Comprehensive simulation experiments validate the effectiveness and optimality of the proposed approach. This work provides a theoretical basis for the robust stabilization of general disturbed nonlinear MIMO systems and enriches the parameter tuning methods of PID controllers from the perspective of dissipativity.</description>

      <title>A Power Electronic Converter Control Framework Based on Graph Neural Networks -- An Early Proof-of-Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power electronic converter control is typically tuned per topology, limiting transfer across heterogeneous designs. This letter proposes a topology-agnostic meta-control framework that encodes converter netlists as typed bipartite graphs and uses a task-conditioned graph neural network backbone with distributed control heads. The policy is trained end-to-end via differentiable predictive control to amortize constrained optimal control over a distribution of converter parameters and reference-tracking tasks. In simulation on randomly sampled buck converters, the learned controller achieves near-optimal tracking performance relative to an online optimal-control baseline, motivating future extension to broader topologies, objectives, and real-time deployment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of thermal sensor allocation and full-chip temperature reconstruction in multi-core systems by leveraging an entropy-based sensor placement strategy and an adaptive compressive sensing approach. By selecting sensor locations that capture diverse thermal behaviors and dynamically adjusting the measurement matrix, our method significantly enhances the accuracy of the full-chip temperature reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces full-chip temperature reconstruction error by 18% to 95%. In addition to the full-chip temperature reconstruction efficiency enhancement, our proposed method improves hardware efficiency by 5% to 514% over the related works. These findings highlight the potential of our method for more effective dynamic temperature management in future high-performance multi-core systems.</description>

      <title>Control and Stability of a Multilevel Power System for a Future Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks poses significant challenges to frequency and voltage stability due to their intermittent nature and low-inertia dynamics. This paper proposes a multilevel control framework for a future decarbonized power system, using energy storage systems as power buffers to mitigate frequency and voltage fluctuations. A nonlinear interconnected model is formulated to characterize the complex dynamics across multiple levels of the distribution network. To reduce operational complexity and communication overhead of these dynamics, a distributed linear quadratic regulator control strategy is developed for information exchange in a bottom-up approach, where each level implements local feedback control within a short time horizon. Stability conditions for both open-loop and closed-loop systems are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, explicit performance bounds are derived to quantify the optimal difference between the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized control method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency response with heterogeneous communication delay management under the SCION Internet architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System operators can increasingly exploit distributed energy resources (DERs) and controllable loads (CLs) to provide frequency response services. In conventional practice, communication between the system operator and flexible devices relies on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-based Internet. However, existing BGP-based architectures face challenges in providing latency-guaranteed control, while direct private and proprietary communication networks lead to additional deployment and maintenance costs. In contrast, the SCION-based Internet architecture supports latency-minimum path selection, which makes it suitable for latency-sensitive frequency contingency services such as fast frequency response (FFR). Hence, this paper proposes a real-time reserve dispatch framework to optimally select a portfolio of flexible devices to deliver FFR services using the SCION-based Internet. First, an analytical expression of the system frequency dynamics with respect to heterogeneous communication latencies is derived. Next, a cyber-physical co-optimization model is formulated to jointly schedule communication paths and physical flexibility resources for real-time FFR provision. To improve the computation efficiency, we propose a heuristic FFR allocation algorithm to approximate the optimal response portfolio, integrating contributions from both DERs and CLs. Numerical case studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm and its capability to approximate the optimality of the reserves allocation while significantly reducing the computation time.</description>

      <title>Hardware-in-the-loop wind-tunnel testing of wake interactions between two floating wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wake interactions in floating wind farms are inherently coupled to platform motion, yet most experimental studies to date neglect this two-way coupling by prescribing platform movements. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind-tunnel methodology to investigate wake interactions between two floating wind turbines with fully coupled aerodynamic loading and platform dynamics. The approach integrates physical wind-tunnel testing of two scaled rotors with a real-time numerical model that accounts for platform motion, mooring restoring forces, and hydrodynamic loads. Experiments conducted under low-turbulence inflow conditions show that a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine experiences reduced mean thrust and platform deflections due to the decreased inflow velocity, alongside enhanced low-frequency platform motions driven by increased turbulent energy in the wake. The proposed HIL framework provides a controlled experimental basis for studying wake-induced excitation mechanisms and supports the validation of floating wind farm models and control strategies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable &amp; Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware LoRaWAN Gateway Placement in Dense Urban Cities Using Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.</description>

      <title>Analysis, detection and control of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in a unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07150v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Observer Design for Visual-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for rigid body systems evolving in three-dimensional space. We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Power-Water Coordination: Unlocking Flexibility in Hybrid RO Desalination Plants via Variable-Speed Pumps and Tank Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient torque allocation for straight-line driving of electric vehicles based on pseudoconvex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.</description>

      <title>Recursive Binary Identification with Differential Privacy and Data Tampering Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation in a bandwidth-constrained sensor network communicating through an insecure medium. The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Studying the Role of Synthetic Data for Machine Learning-based Wireless Networks Traffic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Learning to accelerate Krasnosel'skii-Mann fixed-point iterations with guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation under Uncertain Obstacle Dynamics using Control Barrier Functions and Constrained Convex Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Predefined-time One-Shot Cooperative Estimation, Guidance, and Control for Simultaneous Target Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Affordable Data Collection System for UAVs Taxi Vibration Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.</description>

      <title>Video Generation Models in Robotics -- Applications, Research Challenges, Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</description>

      <title>Personalized Spiking Neural Networks with Ferroelectric Synapses for EEG Signal Processing</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</description>

      <title>Auditory Filter Behavior and Updated Estimated Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filters from the Gammatone family are often used to model auditory signal processing, but the filter constant values used to mimic human hearing are largely set to values based on historical psychoacoustic data collected several decades ago. Here, we move away from this long-standing convention, and estimate filter constants using a range of more recent reported filter characteristics (such as quality factors and ratios between quality factors and peak group delay) within a characteristics-based framework that clarifies how filter behavior is related to the underlying constants. Using a sharp-filter approximation that captures shared peak-region behavior across certain classes of filters, we analyze the range of behaviors accessible when the full degrees of freedom of the filter are utilized rather than fixing the filter order or exponent to historically prescribed values. Filter behavior is characterized using magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics and their ratios, which reveal which characteristics are informative for constraining filter constants and which are only weakly constraining. We show that these insights and estimation methods extend to multiple realizable filter classes from the Gammatone family and apply them, together with recent physiological and psychoacoustic observations, to derive constraints on and estimates for filter constants for human auditory filters. More broadly, this framework supports the design of auditory filters with arbitrary characteristic-level specifications and enables systematic assessment of how variations in filter characteristics influence auditory models, perceptual findings, and technologies that rely on auditory filterbanks.</description>

      <title>Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</description>

      <title>Precision Meets Art: Autonomous Multi-UAV System for Large Scale Mural Drawing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into large-scale artistic projects has emerged as a new application in robotics. This paper presents the design, deployment, and testing of a novel multi-drone system for automated mural painting in outdoor settings. This technology makes use of new software that coordinates multiple drones simultaneously, utilizing state-machine algorithms for task execution. Key advancements are the complex positioning system that combines 2D localization using a single motion tracking camera with onboard LiDAR for precise positioning, and a novel flight control algorithm, which works differently along the trajectory and normally to it, ensuring smoothness and high precision of the drawings at the same time. A 100 square meters mural was created using the developed multi-drone system, validating the system's efficacy. Compared to single-drone approaches, our multi-UAV solution significantly improves scalability and operational speed while maintaining high stability even in harsh weather conditions. The findings highlight the potential of autonomous robotic swarms in creative applications, paving the way for further advancements in large-scale robotic art.</description>

      <title>Water Demand Maximization: Quick Recovery of Nonlinear Physics Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent computational advances enable protein design pipelines to run end-to-end on GPUs, yet their heterogeneous computational behaviors remain undercharacterized at the system level. We implement and profile a representative pipeline at both component and full-pipeline granularities across varying inputs and hyperparameters. Our characterization identifies generally low GPU utilization and high sensitivity to sequence length and sampling strategies. We outline future research directions based on these insights and release an open-source pipeline and profiling scripts to facilitate further studies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Control for Uncertain Systems with Ellipsoid-Set Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.</description>

      <title>TranSC: Hardware-Aware Design of Transcendental Functions Using Stochastic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust maximum hands-off optimal control: existence, maximum principle, and $L^{0}$-$L^1$ equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contract technology facilitates self-executing agreements on the blockchain, eliminating dependency on an external trusted authority. However, smart contracts may expose vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses and disruptions in decentralized applications. In this work, we evaluate deep learning-based approaches for vulnerability scanning of Ethereum smart contracts. We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, providing insights into their detection capabilities and generalizability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for positive (semi-)definiteness, with or without radial unboundedness, for nonquadratic Lyapunov function constructed as sign-indefinite quadratic forms involving the state and the deadzone of a suitable input. We then use these conditions to build weak nonquadratic Lyapunov functions establishing global asymptotic stability of linear systems in feedback through a saturation, leveraging invariance principles. Our results are shown to be non-conservative (necessary and sufficient) for a family of well known prototypical examples of linear SISO feedbacks that are not globally exponentially stabilizable (the so-called ANCBI plants). Our multi-input extension leads to convex stability analysis tests, formulated as linear matrix inequalities that are applicable to ANCBI non-globally-exponentially-stabilizable plants.</description>

      <title>NanoCockpit: Performance-optimized Application Framework for AI-based Autonomous Nanorobotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).</description>

      <title>Frequency-Adaptive Multi-Band Architecture for Upper Mid-Band MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FR3 ($\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.</description>

      <title>Clipped Affine Policy: Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Online Power Control for Energy Harvesting Communications over Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Priority in Schedule-based User Equilibrium Transit Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Grid-based Estimation of Nonlinear Systems with Invertible Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the state estimation of non-linear and non-Gaussian systems with an emphasis on the numerical solution to the Bayesian recursive relations. In particular, this paper builds upon the Lagrangian grid-based filter (GbF) recently-developed for linear systems and extends it for systems with nonlinear dynamics that are invertible. The proposed nonlinear Lagrangian GbF reduces the computational complexity of the standard GbFs from quadratic to log-linear, while preserving all the strengths of the original GbF such as robustness, accuracy, and deterministic behaviour. The proposed filter is compared with the particle filter in several numerical studies using the publicly available MATLAB\textregistered\ implementation\footnote{https://github.com/pesslovany/Matlab-LagrangianPMF}.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decompositions for Online Grid-Based Terrain-Aided Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: https://github.com/pesslovany/Matlab-LagrangianPMF).</description>

      <title>Converse Barrier Certificates for Finite-time Safety Verification of Continuous-time Perturbed Deterministic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of verifying the finite-time safety of continuous-time perturbed deterministic systems represented by ordinary differential equations in the presence of measurable disturbances. Given a finite-time horizon, if the system is safe, it, starting from a compact initial set, will remain within an open and bounded safe region throughout the specified time horizon, regardless of the disturbances. The main contribution of this work is a converse theorem: we prove that a continuously differentiable, time-dependent barrier certificate exists if and only if the system is safe over the finite-time horizon. The existence problem is explored by finding a continuously differentiable approximation of a unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <title>Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</description>

      <title>TuneS: Patient-specific model-based optimization of contact configuration in deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of ten Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</description>

      <title>Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at https://github.com/xslice-5G/code.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation with Limited Data Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since R.D.Middlebrook proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result 4.generality.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control for UAV with Off-center Slung Load</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. An inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.</description>

Abstract: We derive uniform all-time concentration bound of the type 'for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a tutorial on current middlewares in automated vehicles. Our aim is to provide the reader with an overview of current middlewares and to identify open challenges in this field. We start by explaining the fundamentals of software architecture in distributed systems and the distinguishing requirements of Automated Vehicles. We then distinguish between communication middlewares and architecture platforms and highlight their key principles and differences. Next, we present five state-of-the-art middlewares as well as their capabilities and functions. We explore how these middlewares could be applied in the design of future vehicle software and their role in the automotive domain. Finally, we compare the five middlewares presented and discuss open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05946</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</description>

      <title>Surface-Based Manipulation with Modular Foldable Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligence lies not only in the brain (decision-making processes) but in the body (physical morphology). The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.</description>

      <title>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>
