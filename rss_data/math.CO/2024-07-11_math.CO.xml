      <title>The Signed Roman Domination Number of Ladder graphs, circular Ladder graphs and their complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite connected simple graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. A signed Roman dominating function (SRDF) on a graph $G$ is a function $f: V \rightarrow \{-1, 1, 2\}$ that satisfies two conditions: (i) $\sum_{y\in N[x]} f(y)\geq1$ for each $x\in V$, where the set $N[x]$ is the closed neighborhood of $x$ consisting of $x$ and vertices of $V$ that are adjacent to $x$, and (ii) each vertex $x\in V$ where $f(x) = -1$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $y\in V$ where $f(y)=2$. The weight of a SRDF is the sum of its function values over all vertices. The signed Roman domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{SR}(G)$, is the minimum weight of a SRDF on $G$. In this paper, we investigate the signed Roman domination number of the Ladder graph $LG_n$, the circular Ladder graph $CL_n$ and their complements.</description>

      <title>The Prisoners and the Swap: Less than Half is Enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the solution of the classical prisoners and drawers riddle, where all prisoners can find their number using the pointer-following strategy, provided that the prisoners can send a spy to inspect all drawers and swap one pair of numbers. In the traditional approach, each prisoner may need to open up to half of the drawers. We show that this strategy is sub-optimal. Remarkably, a single swap allows all $n$ prisoners to find their number by opening only $\frac{n \ln \ln n}{\ln n} (1 + o(1))$ drawers in the worst case. We show that no strategy can do better than that by a factor larger than two. Efficiently constructing such a strategy is harder, but we provide an explicit efficient strategy that requires opening only $O(\frac{n \log \log n}{\log n})$ drawers by each prisoner in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Small Ramsey numbers for books, wheels, and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note gives several new upper and lower bounds on Ramsey numbers for books and wheels, including tight lower bounds establishing the Ramsey numbers $R(B_3, B_6) = 19$, $R(B_4,B_5)=19$, $R(B_5,B_6)= 23$, and $R(B_6,B_7)= 27$, and tight upper and lower bounds establishing $R(W_5, W_7) = 15$. The new upper bound was obtained using the flag algebra method, and the lower bounds come from constructions discovered using tabu search.
  We also explore generalized Ramsey numbers using similar methods. Let $GR(r,K_s,t)$ denote the minimum number of vertices $n$ such that any $r$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $K_s$ with at most $t$ colors. We establish $GR(3,K_4,2) = 10$, $GR(4,K_4,3) = 10$, and some additional bounds.</description>

      <title>The synchronisation hierarchy via coherent configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the spreading property for finite transitive permutation groups in terms of properties of their associated coherent configurations, in much the same way that separating and synchronising groups can be described via properties of their orbital graphs. We also show how the other properties in the synchronisation hierarchy naturally fit inside this framework. This combinatorial description allows for more efficient computational tools, and we deduce that every spreading permutation group of degree at most $8191$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$I-group. We also consider design-orthogonality more generally for noncommutative homogeneous coherent configurations.</description>

      <title>Counting Permutations in $S_{2n}$ and $S_{2n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(n)$ denote the number of perfect square permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. The conjecture $\alpha(2n+1) = (2n+1) \alpha(2n)$, provided by Stanley[4], was proved by Blum[1] using a generating function. This paper presents a combinatorial proof for this conjecture. At the same time, we demonstrate that all permutations with an even number of even cycles in both $S_{2n}$ and $S_{2n+1}$ can be categorized into three distinct types that correspond to each other.</description>

      <title>A simple proof on the number of $(3 \times n)$-Latin rectangles based on a set of $\lambda$ elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980, Athreya, Pranesachar and Singhi established the chromatic polynomial of $(3 \times n)$-Latin rectangles whose entries based on a set $\{1, 2, ..., \lambda\}$ in which $\lambda \geq n$. Their proof requires M\"{o}bius inversion formula and lattice partitions. In this paper, we present a simpler proof by using the idea of mathematical induction and appropriate coloring.</description>

      <title>On the size multipartite Ramsey numbers involving complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs H and G, the size multipartite Ramsey number mj (H, G) is the smallest natural number t such that an arbitrary coloring of the edges of Kjt, complete multipartite graph whose vertex set is partitioned into j parts each of size t, using two colors red and blue, necessarily forces a red copy of H or a blue copy of G as a subgraph. The notion of size multipartite Ramsey number has been introduced by Burger and Vuuren in 2004. It is worth noting that, this concept is derived by using the idea of the original classical Ramsey number, multipartite Ramsey number and the size Ramsey number. In this paper, we focus on mj(H, G) and find a lower bound for mj (H, G) based on the chromatic number of H and the order of G. Also, for graphs G with large maximum degree, we obtain a tight lower bound for mj(Km, G). Furthermore, we determine the order of magnitude of mj(Km, K1,n), for j &gt;= m &gt;= 3 and n &gt;= 2. Then we specify the exact values of mj(Km, K1,n) for the cases m = j, m = 3 and j = 0 or m-2 (mod m-2).</description>

      <title>Further Results and Questions on $S$-Packing Coloring of Subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $a_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. We consider the $S$-packing coloring problem on subclasses of subcubic graphs: For $0\le i\le 3$, a subcubic graph $G$ is said to be $i$-saturated if every vertex of degree 3 is adjacent to at most $i$ vertices of degree 3. Furthermore, a vertex of degree 3 in a subcubic graph is called heavy if all its three neighbors are of degree 3, and $G$ is said to be $(3,i)$-saturated if every heavy vertex is adjacent to at most $i$ heavy vertices. We prove that every 1-saturated subcubic graph is $(1,1,3,3)$-packing colorable and $(1,2,2,2,2)$-packing colorable. We also prove that every $(3,0)$-saturated subcubic graph is $(1,2,2,2,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Group Vertex Magic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a simple undirected graph and let A be an additive Abelian group with identity 0. In this paper, we introduce the concept of group magic spectrum of a graph G with respect to a given Abelian group A and is defined as spec(G, A):= {{\lambda} : {\lambda} is a magic constant of some A-vertex magic labeling f }. In their recent work, K. M. Sabeel et al. in Australas. J. Combin. 85(1) (2023), 49-60 proved a forbidden subgraph characterization for the group vertex magic graph. In this work, we present a new method which uses minimum number of vertices required for this graph. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the spectrum of a graph G to be a subgroup when A = V4 or Zp, where p is a prime number. Also we introduce the notion of reduced spectrum redspec(G, A) and study the relation between spec(G, A) and redspec(G, A).</description>

      <title>Anzahl theorems for trivially intersecting subspaces generating a non-singular subspace I: symplectic and hermitian forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve a classical counting problem for non-degenerate forms of symplectic and hermitian type defined on a vector space: given a subspace $\pi$, we find the number of non-singular subspaces that are trivially intersecting with $\pi$ and span a non-singular subspace with $\pi$. Lower bounds for the quantity of such pairs where $\pi$ is non-singular were first studied in ``Glasby, Niemayer, Praeger (Finite Fields Appl., 2022)'', which was later improved in ``Glasby, Ihringer, Mattheus (Des. Codes Cryptogr., 2023)'' and generalised in ``Glasby, Niemayer, Praeger (Linear Algebra Appl., 2022)''. In this paper, we derive explicit formulae, which allow us to give the exact proportion and improve the known lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Graph Reconstruction with Connectivity Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem of reconstruction of connected graphs where the input gives all subsets of size k that induce a connected subgraph. Originally introduced by Bastide et al. (WG 2023) for triples ($k=3$), this problem received comprehensive attention in their work, alongside a study by Qi, who provided a complete characterization of graphs uniquely reconstructible via their connected triples, i.e. no other graphs share the same set of connected triples. Our contribution consists in output-polynomial time algorithms that enumerate every triangle-free graph (resp. every graph with bounded maximum degree) that is consistent with a specified set of connected $k$-sets. Notably, we prove that triangle-free graphs are uniquely reconstructible, while graphs with bounded maximum degree that are consistent with the same $k$-sets share a substantial common structure, differing only locally. We suspect that the problem is NP-hard in general and provide a NP-hardness proof for a variant where the connectivity is specified for only some $k$-sets (with $k$ at least 4).</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC for short) are a family of polynomials whose orthogonality is given by integration over the unit circle in the complex plane. There are combinatorial studies on the moments of various types of orthogonal polynomials, including classical orthogonal polynomials, Laurent biorthogonal polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials of type \( R_I \). In this paper, we study the moments of OPUC from a combinatorial perspective. We provide three path interpretations for them: \L{}ukasiewicz paths, gentle Motzkin paths, and Schr\"oder paths. Additionally, using these combinatorial interpretations, we derive explicit formulas for the generalized moments of some examples of OPUC, including the circular Jacobi polynomials and the Rogers--Szeg\H{o} polynomials. Furthermore, we introduce several kinds of generalized linearization coefficients and give combinatorial interpretations for them.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for zero-sum cycles in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite Abelian group $(\Gamma,+)$, let $n(\Gamma)$ denote the smallest positive integer $n$ such that for each labelling of the arcs of the complete digraph of order $n$ using elements from $\Gamma$, there exists a directed cycle such that the total sum of the arc-labels along the cycle equals $0$. Alon and Krivelevich initiated the study of the parameter $n(\cdot)$ on cyclic groups and proved that $n(\mathbb{Z}_q)=O(q\log q)$. Studying the prototypical case when $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_p^d$ is a power of a cyclic group of prime order, Letzter and Morrison recently showed that $n(\mathbb{Z}_p^d) \le O(pd(\log d)^2)$ and that $n(\mathbb{Z}_2^d)\le O(d \log d)$. They then posed the problem of proving an (asymptotically optimal) upper bound of $n(\mathbb{Z}_p^d)\le O(pd)$ for all primes $p$ and $d \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we solve this problem for $p=2$ and improve their bound for all primes $p \ge 3$ by proving $n(\mathbb{Z}_2^d)\le 5d$ and $n(\mathbb{Z}_p^d)\le O(pd\log d)$. While the first bound determines $n(\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ up to a multiplicative error of $5$, the second bound is tight up to a $\log d$ factor. Moreover, our result shows that a tight bound of $n(\mathbb{Z}_p^d)=\Theta(pd)$ for arbitrary $p$ and $d$ would follow from a (strong form) of the well-known conjecture of Jaeger, Linial, Payan and Tarsi on additive bases in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$.
  Along the way to proving these results, we establish a generalization of a hypergraph matching result by Haxell in a matroidal setting. Concretely, we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of matchings in a hypergraph whose hyperedges are labelled by the elements of a matroid, with the property that the edges in the matching induce a basis of the matroid. We believe that these statements are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Completing the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present four different constructions of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences, and use them to obtain expressions for the enumeration sequences of 22 distinct open cases. This completes the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding one or two patterns of length 3. Some of our constructions are based on generating trees. Others involve pattern-avoiding words, which we also count using generating trees. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization of inversion sequences, which we call shifted inversion sequences. It is sometimes easier to construct pattern-avoiding inversion sequences by seeing them as a particular case of shifted inversion sequences.</description>

      <title>Directed Transit Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit functions were introduced as models of betweenness on undirected structures. Here we introduce directed transit function as the directed analogue on directed structures such as posets and directed graphs. We first show that betweenness in posets can be expressed by means of a simple set of first order axioms. Similar characterizations can be obtained for graphs with natural partial orders, in particular, forests, trees, and mangroves. Relaxing the acyclicity conditions leads to a generalization of the well-known geometric transit function to the directed structures. Moreover, we discuss some properties of the directed analogues of prominent transit functions, including the all-paths, induced paths, and shortest paths (or interval) transit functions. Finally we point out some open questions and directions for future work.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, both edge and mixed metric dimensions of Johnson graphs $J_{n,k}$ are considered. A new tight lower bound for $\beta_E(J_{n,k})$ based on hitting sets has been obtained. Using this bound, exact values for $\beta_E(J_{n,2})$ and $\beta_M(J_{n,2})$ have been derived, and it is proved that $\beta_E(J_{n,2}) = \beta_M(J_{n,2})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study two structures associated to permutation groups: Dirichlet characters on permutation groups, and the "cycle form," a bilinear form on the group algebras of permutation groups. We use Dirichlet characters and the cycle form to find a new upper bound on the number of unlabelled bicolored graphs with $p$ red vertices and $q$ blue vertices. We use this bound to calculate the asymptotic growth rate of the number of such graphs as $p,q\rightarrow\infty$, answering a 1973 question of Harrison in the case where $q-p$ is fixed. As an application, we show that, in an asymptotic sense, "most" elements of the power set $P(\{ 1, \dots ,p\} \times \{ 1, \dots ,q\})$ are in free $\Sigma_p\times \Sigma_q$-orbits.</description>

      <title>A proposed crank for $(k+j)$-colored partitions, with $j$ colors having distinct parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1988, George Andrews and Frank Garvan discovered a crank for $p(n)$. In 2020, Larry Rolen, Zack Tripp, and Ian Wagner generalized the crank for p(n) in order to accommodate Ramanujan-like congruences for $k$-colored partitions. In this paper, we utilize the techniques used by Rolen, Tripp, and Wagner for crank generating functions in order to define a crank generating function for $(k + j)$-colored partitions where $j$ colors have distinct parts. We provide three infinite families of crank generating functions and conjecture a general crank generating function for such partitions.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $5$ and $7$ for the crank and rank parity functions and related mock theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that Ramanujan conjectured congruences modulo powers of $5$, $7$ and and $11$ for the partition function. These were subsequently proved by Watson (1938) and Atkin (1967). In 2009 Choi, Kang, and Lovejoy proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the crank parity function. The generating function for the analogous rank parity function is $f(q)$, the first example of a mock theta function that Ramanujan mentioned in his last letter to Hardy. Recently we proved congruences modulo powers of $5$ for the rank parity function, and here we extend these congruences for powers of $7$. We also show how these congruences imply congruences modulo powers of $5$ and $7$ for the coefficients of the related third order mock theta function $\omega(q)$, using Atkin-Lehner involutions and transformation results of Zwegers. Finally we a prove a family of congruences modulo powers of $7$ for the crank parity function.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we construct matrices associated to Pachner $\frac{n-1}{2}$-$\frac{n-1}{2}$ moves for odd $n$ and matrices associated to Pachner $(\frac{n}{2}-1)$-$\frac{n}{2}$ moves for even $n$. The entries of these matrices are rational functions of formal variables in a field. We prove that these matrices satisfy the $n$-gon equation for any $n$.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve the Half-Singleton Bound for Insertions and Deletions over Linear-Sized Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that with high probability, random Reed-Solomon codes approach the half-Singleton bound - the optimal rate versus error tradeoff for linear insdel codes - with linear-sized alphabets. More precisely, we prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and positive integers $n$ and $k$, with high probability, random Reed--Solomon codes of length $n$ and dimension $k$ can correct $(1-\varepsilon)n-2k+1$ adversarial insdel errors over alphabets of size $n+2^{\mathsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}k$. This significantly improves upon the alphabet size demonstrated in the work of Con, Shpilka, and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2023), who showed the existence of Reed--Solomon codes with exponential alphabet size $\widetilde O\left(\binom{n}{2k-1}^2\right)$ precisely achieving the half-Singleton bound.
  Our methods are inspired by recent works on list-decoding Reed-Solomon codes. Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam (STOC 2023) showed that random Reed-Solomon codes are list-decodable up to capacity with exponential-sized alphabets, and Guo-Zhang (FOCS 2023) and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li (STOC 2024) improved the alphabet-size to linear. We achieve a similar alphabet-size reduction by similarly establishing strong bounds on the probability that certain random rectangular matrices are full rank. To accomplish this in our insdel context, our proof combines the random matrix techniques from list-decoding with structural properties of Longest Common Subsequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the results on the graph closures of the birational maps between projective spaces and Grassmannians to the case of PBW degenerate flag varieties. The advantage of the PBW degenerate flags (as opposed to their classical analogues) is the existence of a large group of symmetries for the graph closures. We discuss the combinatorial, algebraic and geometric sides of the picture. In particular, we show that toric degenerations of Borovik, Sturmfels and Sverrisd\'ottir are still available in the general settings. We also derive a description of the graph closures for flag varieties in terms of quiver representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that a deterministic approximation algorithm for this problems must have at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ runtime. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.2995})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.599})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Theorems for Trees and a General 'Private Learning Implies Online Learning' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work continues to investigate the link between differentially private (DP) and online learning. Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019) showed that for binary concept classes, DP learnability of a given class implies that it has a finite Littlestone dimension (equivalently, that it is online learnable). Their proof relies on a model-theoretic result by Hodges (1997), which demonstrates that any binary concept class with a large Littlestone dimension contains a large subclass of thresholds. In a follow-up work, Jung, Kim, and Tewari (2020) extended this proof to multiclass PAC learning with a bounded number of labels. Unfortunately, Hodges's result does not apply in other natural settings such as multiclass PAC learning with an unbounded label space, and PAC learning of partial concept classes.
  This naturally raises the question of whether DP learnability continues to imply online learnability in more general scenarios: indeed, Alon, Hanneke, Holzman, and Moran (2021) explicitly leave it as an open question in the context of partial concept classes, and the same question is open in the general multiclass setting. In this work, we give a positive answer to these questions showing that for general classification tasks, DP learnability implies online learnability. Our proof reasons directly about Littlestone trees, without relying on thresholds. We achieve this by establishing several Ramsey-type theorems for trees, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Edge-dominance games on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider zero-sum games in which players move between adjacent states, where in each pair of adjacent states one state dominates the other. The states in our game can represent positional advantages in physical conflict such as high ground or camouflage, or product characteristics that lend an advantage over competing sellers in a duopoly. We study the equilibria of the game as a function of the topological and geometric properties of the underlying graph. Our main result characterizes the expected payoff of both players starting from any initial position, under the assumption that the graph does not contain certain types of small cycles. This characterization leverages the block-cut tree of the graph, a construction that describes the topology of the biconnected components of the graph. We identify three natural types of (on-path) pure equilibria, and characterize when these equilibria exist under the above assumptions. On the geometric side, we show that strongly connected outerplanar graphs with undirected girth at least 4 always support some of these types of on-path pure equilibria. Finally, we show that a data structure describing all pure equilibria can be efficiently computed for these games.</description>

Abstract: We show that there always exists an inscribed square in a Jordan curve given as the union of two graphs of functions of Lipschitz constant less than $1 + \sqrt{2}$. We are motivated by Tao's result that there exists such a square in the case of Lipschitz constant less than $1$. In the case of Lipschitz constant $1$, we show that the Jordan curve inscribes rectangles of every similarity class. Our approach involves analysing the change in the spectral invariants of the Jordan Floer homology under perturbations of the Jordan curve.</description>

      <title>A higher-order generalization of group theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that fundamental concepts in higher-order Fourier analysis can be nauturally extended to the non-commutative setting. We generalize Gowers norms to arbitrary compact non-commutative groups. On the structural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of higher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all non-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called "groupspaces" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to nilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special groupspaces called {\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups. We show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal bundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more technical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely many structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense analogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the Eckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for $i\geq 2$. Groupspaces also show some similarities with $n$-groups from higher category theory (also used in physics) but the exact relationship between these concepts is a subject of future research.</description>

Abstract: Graph combinatorial optimization problems are widely applicable and notoriously difficult to compute; for example, consider the traveling salesman or facility location problems. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on graph images to predict the cardinality of combinatorial properties of random graphs and networks. Specifically, we use image representations of modified adjacency matrices of random graphs as training samples for a CNN model to predict the stability number of random graphs; where the stability number is the cardinality of a maximum set of vertices containing no pairwise adjacency. Our approach demonstrates the potential for applying deep learning in combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

Abrams introduced a cubical complex, denoted here by DConf$(G,n)$, sitting inside Conf$(G,n)$ as a strong deformation retract provided $G$ is suitably subdivided. Using discrete Morse Theory techniques, we extend Abrams' result to the realm of configurations having no $k$-fold collisions.</description>

Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>The convex dimension of hypergraphs and the hypersimplicial Van Kampen-Flores Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.01189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convex dimension of a $k$-uniform hypergraph is the smallest dimension $d$ for which there is an injective mapping of its vertices into $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the set of $k$-barycenters of all hyperedges is in convex position. We completely determine the convex dimension of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs, which settles an open question by Halman, Onn and Rothblum, who solved the problem for complete graphs. We also provide lower and upper bounds for the extremal problem of estimating the maximal number of hyperedges of $k$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices with convex dimension $d$. To prove these results, we restate them in terms of affine projections that preserve the vertices of the hypersimplex. More generally, we provide a full characterization of the projections that preserve its $i$-dimensional skeleton. In particular, we obtain a hypersimplicial generalization of the linear van Kampen-Flores theorem: for each $n$, $k$ and $i$ we determine onto which dimensions can the $(n,k)$-hypersimplex be linearly projected while preserving its $i$-skeleton. Our results have direct interpretations in terms of $k$-sets and $(i,j)$-partitions, and are closely related to the problem of finding large convexly independent subsets in Minkowski sums of $k$ point sets.</description>

Abstract: Hadamard diagonalizable graphs are undirected graphs for which the corresponding Laplacian is diagonalizable by a Hadamard matrix. Such graphs have been studied in the context of quantum state transfer. Recently, the concept of a weak Hadamard matrix was introduced: a $\{-1,0, 1\}$-matrix $P$ such that $PP^T$ is tridiagonal, as well as the concept of weakly Hadamard diagonalizable graphs. We therefore naturally explore quantum state transfer in these generalized Hadamards. Given the infancy of the topic, we provide numerous properties and constructions of weak Hadamard matrices and weakly Hadamard diagonalizable graphs in order to better understand them.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the zeros of the chromatic polynomial via Whitney's Broken Circuit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the zeros of its chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ (in $\mathbb{C}$) lie inside the disc of radius $5.94 \Delta$ centered at $0$. This improves on the previously best known bound of approximately $6.91\Delta$.
  We also obtain improved bounds for graphs of high girth. We prove that for every $g$ there is a constant $K_g$ such that for any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and girth at least $g$, the zeros of its chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ lie inside the disc of radius $K_g \Delta$ centered at $0$, where $K_g$ is the solution to a certain optimization problem. In particular, $K_g &lt; 5$ when $g \geq 5$ and $K_g &lt; 4$ when $g \geq 25$ and $K_g$ tends to approximately $3.86$ as $g \to \infty$.
  Key to the proof is a classical theorem of Whitney which allows us to relate the chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$ to the generating function of so-called broken-circuit-free forests in $G$. We also establish a zero-free disc for the generating function of all forests in $G$ (aka the partition function of the arboreal gas) which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of finite CAT(0) cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that finite CAT(0) cube complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). This result was conjectured by Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2023). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete version of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry. In the proofs, we use the bijection between CAT(0) cube complexes and median graphs and the corner peelings of median graphs.</description>

      <title>Rainbow common graphs must be forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rainbow version of the graph commonness property: a graph $H$ is $r$-rainbow common if the number of rainbow copies of $H$ (where all edges have distinct colors) in an $r$-coloring of edges of $K_n$ is maximized asymptotically by independently coloring each edge uniformly at random. $H$ is \emph{$r$-rainbow uncommon} otherwise. We show that if $H$ has a cycle, then it is $r$-rainbow uncommon for every $r$ at least the number of edges of $H$. This generalizes a result of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal, and proves a conjecture of De Silva, Si, Tait, Tun\c{c}bilek, Yang, and Young.</description>

      <title>Ternary and quaternary positroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A positroid is an ordered matroid realizable by a real matrix with all nonnegative maximal minors. Postnikov gave a map from ordered matroids to Grassmann necklaces, for which there is a unique positroid in each fiber of the map. Here, we give forbidden minor characterizations of ternary and quaternary positroids. We show that a positroid is ternary if and only if it is near-regular, and that all ternary positroids are formed by direct sums and $2$-sums of binary positroids and positroid ordered whirls. We prove that a positroid is quaternary if and only if it is $U^2_6, U^4_6,$ and $P_6$-free. Under the map from ordered matroids to Grassmann necklaces, we fully characterize the fibers of ternary positroids, referred to as their positroid envelope classes; in particular, the envelope class of a positroid ordered whirl of rank-$r$ contains exactly four matroids.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a pseudotree from the distance matrix of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices.
  The boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of a graph $G=([n],E)$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$.
  Given a square matrix $\hat{B}$ of order $\kappa$, we prove under which conditions $\hat{B}$ is the distance matrix $\hat{D}_T$ of the set of leaves of a tree $T$, which is precisely its boundary.
  We show that if $G$ is either a block graph or a unicyclic graph, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the boundary distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of $G$ and we also conjecture that this statement holds for every connected graph $G$, whenever both the order $n$ and the boundary (and thus also the boundary distance matrix) of $G$ are prefixed.
  Moreover, an algorithm for reconstructing a 1-block graph (resp., a unicyclic graph) from its boundary distance matrix is given, whose time complexity in the worst case is $O(\kappa n)$ (resp., $O(n^2)$).</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>Two problems of existence of total and edge-girth colorings in regular graphs via efficient dominating sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08781v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a regular graph $G$. A total coloring of $G$ via a set formed by one more color, or twice the colors, than the degree of $G$ is said to be a {\it totally efficient coloring} of {\it type $+1$}, or {\it type $\times 2$}, respectively, if each color class is an efficient dominating set. It is shown here that the binary 3-cube $Q_3$ has a totally efficient coloring. This in turn yields an edge-girth coloring of the binary 4-cube $Q_4$. It is conjectured that such totally efficient coloring of $Q_3$ is the only existing one in any regular graph $G$ of type $+1$, yielding an edge-girth coloring of the prism of $G$. We also deal with regular graphs of type $\times 2$ exemplified by star (multiset) transposition graphs and leading to edge-girth colorings on their prisms (or the prisms of their Hamming shells, respectively).</description>

      <title>Orbit structures and complexity in Schubert and Richardson Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide a type-uniform formula for the torus complexity of the usual torus action on a Richardson variety, by developing the notion of algebraic dimensions of Bruhat intervals, strengthening a type $A$ result by Donten-Bury, Escobar and Portakal. In the process, we give an explicit description of the torus action on any Deodhar component as well as describe the root subgroups that comprise the component. Secondly, when a Levi subgroup in a reductive algebraic group acts on a Schubert variety, we exhibit a codimension preserving bijection between the Levi-Borel subgroup (a Borel subgroup in the Levi subgroup) orbits in the big open cell of that Schubert variety and torus orbits in the big open cell of a distinguished Schubert subvariety. This bijection has many applications including a type-uniform formula for the Levi-Borel complexity of the usual Levi-Borel subgroup action on a Schubert variety. We conclude by extending the Levi-Borel complexity results to a large class of Schubert varieties in the partial flag variety.</description>

Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz conjectured that every connected vertex-transitive graph contains a hamilton path in 1970. First we reveal the structure of connected vertex-transitive graphs with an odd number of vertices.

      <description>arXiv:2303.06986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation is firstly focused into showing that two metric parameters represent the same object in graph theory. That is, we prove that the multiset resolving sets and the ID-colorings of graphs are the same thing. We also consider some computational and combinatorial problems of the multiset dimension, or equivalently, the ID-number of graphs. We prove that the decision problem concerning finding the multiset dimension of graphs is NP-complete. We consider the multiset dimension of king grids and prove that it is bounded above by 4. We also give a characterization of the strong product graphs with one factor being a complete graph, and whose multiset dimension is not infinite.</description>

      <title>Integer partitions detect the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that integer partitions, the fundamental building blocks in additive number theory, detect prime numbers in an unexpected way. Answering a question of Schneider, we show that the primes are the solutions to special equations in partition functions. For example, an integer $n\geq 2$ is prime if and only if
  $$
  (3n^3 - 13n^2 + 18n - 8)M_1(n) + (12n^2 - 120n + 212)M_2(n) -960M_3(n) = 0,
  $$
  where the $M_a(n)$ are MacMahon's well-studied partition functions. More generally, for "MacMahonesque" partition functions $M_{\vec{a}}(n),$ we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients, such as
  $$
  80M_{(1,1,1)}(n)-12M_{(2,0,1)}(n)+12M_{(2,1,0)}(n)+\dots-12M_{(1,3)}(n)-39M_{(3,1)}(n)=0.

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>
