      <title>Motivating REML via Prediction-Error Covariances in EM Updates for Linear Mixed Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational motivation for restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation in linear mixed models using an expectation--maximization (EM) algorithm. At each iteration, maximum likelihood (ML) and REML solve the same mixed-model equations for the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the fixed effects and the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of the random effects. They differ only in the trace adjustments used in the variance-component updates: ML uses conditional covariances of the random effects given the data, whereas REML uses prediction-error covariances from Henderson's C-matrix, reflecting uncertainty from estimating the fixed effects. Short R code makes this switch explicit, exposes the key matrices for classroom inspection, and reproduces lme4 ML and REML fits.</description>

      <title>Estimating Individual Customer Lifetime Values with R: The CLVTools Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customer lifetime value (CLV) describes a customer's long-term economic value for a business. This metric is widely used in marketing, for example, to select customers for a marketing campaign. However, modeling CLV is challenging. When relying on customers' purchase histories, the input data is sparse. Additionally, given its long-term focus, prediction horizons are often longer than estimation periods. Probabilistic models are able to overcome these challenges and, thus, are a popular option among researchers and practitioners. The latter also appreciate their applicability for both small and big data as well as their robust predictive performance without any fine-tuning requirements. Their popularity is due to three characteristics: data parsimony, scalability, and predictive accuracy. The R package CLVTools provides an efficient and user-friendly implementation framework to apply key probabilistic models such as the Pareto/NBD and Gamma-Gamma model. Further, it provides access to the latest model extensions to include time-invariant and time-varying covariates, parameter regularization, and equality constraints. This article gives an overview of the fundamental ideas of these statistical models and illustrates their application to derive CLV predictions for existing and new customers.</description>

      <title>Continuous mixtures of Gaussian processes as models for spatial extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial modelling of extreme values allows studying the risk of joint occurrence of extreme events at different locations and is of significant interest in climatic and other environmental sciences. A popular class of dependence models for spatial extremes is that of random location-scale mixtures, in which a spatial "baseline" process is multiplied or shifted by a random variable, potentially altering its extremal dependence behaviour. Gaussian location-scale mixtures retain benefits of their Gaussian baseline processes while overcoming some of their limitations, such as symmetry, light tails and weak tail dependence. We review properties of Gaussian location-scale mixtures and develop novel constructions with interesting features, together with a general algorithm for conditional simulation from these models. We leverage their flexibility to propose extended extreme-value models, that allow for appropriately modelling not only the tails but also the bulk of the data. This is important in many applications and avoids the need to explicitly select the events considered as extreme. We propose new solutions for likelihood inference in parametric models of Gaussian location-scale mixtures, in order to avoid the numerical bottleneck given by the latent location and scale variables that can lead to high computational cost of standard likelihood evaluations. The effectiveness of the models and of the inference methods is confirmed with simulated data examples, and we present an application to wildfire-related weather variables in Portugal. Although not detailed here, the approaches would also be straightforward to use for modelling multivariate (non spatial) data.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Approximating Conditionally Optimal Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops algorithms for non-parametric confidence regions for samples from a univariate distribution whose support is a discrete mesh bounded on the left. We generalize the theory of Learned-Miller to preorders over the sample space. In this context, we show that the lexicographic low and lexicographic high orders are in some way extremal in the class of monotone preorders. From this theory we derive several approximation algorithms: 1) Closed form approximations for the lexicographic low and high orders with error tending to zero in the mesh size; 2) A polynomial-time approximation scheme for quantile orders with error tending to zero in the mesh size; 3) Monte Carlo methods for calculating quantile and lexicographic low orders applicable to any mesh size.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the fundamental problem of using i.i.d. coin tosses from an entropy source to efficiently generate random variables $X_i \sim P_i$ $(i \ge 1)$, where $(P_1, P_2, \dots)$ is a random sequence of rational discrete probability distributions subject to an \textit{arbitrary} stochastic process. Our method achieves an amortized expected entropy cost within $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ bits of the information-theoretically optimal Shannon lower bound using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space. This result holds both pointwise in terms of the Shannon information content conditioned on $X_i$ and $P_i$, and in expectation to obtain a rate of $\mathbb{E}[H(P_1) + \dots + H(P_n)]/n + \varepsilon$ bits per sample as $n \to \infty$ (where $H$ is the Shannon entropy). The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao (1976) entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi (1997) interval algorithm for online sampling, which require unbounded space. It also uses exponentially less space than the more specialized methods of Kozen and Soloviev (2022) and Shao and Wang (2025) that generate i.i.d. samples from a fixed distribution. Our online sampling algorithm rests on a powerful algorithmic technique called \textit{randomness recycling}, which reuses a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its amortized entropy cost.
  On the practical side, we develop randomness recycling techniques to accelerate a variety of prominent sampling algorithms. We show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, and that it reduces the entropy cost of discrete Gaussian sampling. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo approximations of Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$. We consider several partial differential equations (PDEs) whose solution is a minimiser of the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$ and connect them to well-known Monte Carlo algorithms. We focus in particular on PDEs obtained by considering the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry over the space of probabilities and show that these lead to a natural implementation using importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo. We propose a novel algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao flow of the Kullback--Leibler divergence and conduct an extensive empirical study to identify when these algorithms outperforms other popular Monte Carlo algorithms.</description>
