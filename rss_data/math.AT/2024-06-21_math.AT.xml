      <title>Polyhedral products in abstract and motivic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce polyhedral products in an $\infty$-categorical setting. We generalize a splitting result by Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen, and Gitler that determines the stable homotopy type of the a polyhedral product. We also introduce a motivic refinement of moment-angle complexes and use the splitting result to compute cellular $\mathbb{A}^1$-homology, and $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics.</description>

      <title>Formal groups over non-commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the usual theory of formal group laws where the base ring is not required to be commutative and where the formal variables need neither be central nor have to commute with each other.
  We show that this is the natural kind of formal group law for the needs of algebraic topology in the sense that a (possibly non-commutative) complex oriented ring spectrum is canonically equipped with just such a formal group law. The universal formal group law is carried by the Baker-Richter spectrum M{\xi} which plays a role analogous to MU in this non-commutative context.
  As suggested by previous work of Morava the Hopf algebra B of "formal diffeomorphisms of the non-commutative line" of Brouder, Frabetti and Krattenthaler is central to the theory developed here. In particular, we verify Morava's conjecture that there is a representation of the Drinfeld quantum-double D(B) through cohomology operations in M{\xi}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison result between two duality statements - Takai duality, which is implemented by the crossed product functor $- \rtimes G: KK^{G} \to KK^{\hat G}$ on equivariant Kasparov categories; and Treumann duality, which asserts the existence of an exotic equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories $\text{Mod}(KU_p[G])^{ft} \simeq \text{Mod}(KU_p[\hat G])^{ft}$ given by tensoring with a particular $(G,\hat G)$-bimodule $M_E$ and $p$-completing.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>A Heegaard-Floer TQFT for link cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Heegaard-Floer homology functor from the category of oriented links in closed $3$-manifolds and oriented surface cobordisms in $4$-manifolds connecting them to the category of $\mathbb{F}[v]$-modules and $\mathbb{F}[v]$-homomorphisms between them, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the field with two elements. In comparison with previously defined TQFTs for decorated links and link cobordisms, the construction of this paper has the advantage of being independent from the decoration. Some of the basic properties of this functor are also explored.</description>

      <title>Relative Group Trisections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trisections of closed 4-manifolds, first defined and studied by Gay and Kirby, have proved to be a useful tool in the systematic analysis of 4-manifolds via handlebodies. Subsequent work of Abrams, Gay, and Kirby established a connection with the algebraic notion of a group trisection, which strikingly defines a one-to-one correspondence. We generalize the notion of a group trisection to the non-closed case by defining and studying relative group trisections. We establish an analogous one-to-one correspondence between relative trisections and relative group trisections up to equivalence. The key lemma in the construction may be of independent interest, as it generalizes the classical fact that there is a unique handlebody extension of a surface realizing a given surjection. Moreover, we establish a functorial relationship between relative trisections of manifolds and groups, extending work of Klug in the closed case.</description>

      <title>Steenrod operations on polyhedral products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the action of the mod $2$ Steenrod algebra on the cohomology of various polyhedral products and related spaces. We carry this out for Davis-Januszkiewicz spaces and their generalizations, for moment-angle complexes as well as for certain polyhedral joins. By studying the combinatorics of underlying simplicial complexes, we deduce some consequences for the lowest cohomological dimension in which non-trivial Steenrod operations can appear.
  We present a version of cochain-level formulas for Steenrod operations on simplicial complexes. We explain the idea of "propagating" such formulas from a simplicial complex $K$ to polyhedral joins over $K$ and we give examples of this process. We tie the propagation of the Steenrod algebra actions on polyhedral joins to those on moment-angle complexes. Although these are cases where one can understand the Steenrod action via a stable homotopy decomposition, we anticipate applying this method to cases where there is no such decomposition.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$. For any simple $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>On the extension problems for the 33-stem homotopy groups of the 6-, 7- and 8-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the extension problems for the homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the puzzles having remained unsolved for forty-five years. We give an unstable approach of the May-Lawrences matrix Toda bracket, which becomes a useful tool for the theory of determinations of unstable homotopy groups. And therefore we are able to solve the extension problems with respect to these three homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for Soft random simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. The soft random simplicial complexes is a model for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$. This new model depends on a probability vector $\rho$ which allows the simplicial complexes to present randomness in all dimensions. In this article, we use a normal approximation theorem to prove central limit theorems for the number of $k$-faces and for the Euler's characteristic for soft random simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Floer-type bipersistence modules and rectangle barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07847v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the pointwise finite-dimensional two-parameter persistence module $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$, defined in terms of interlevel filtered Floer homology, is rectangle-decomposable. This allows for the definition of a barcode $\mathcal{B}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$ consisting only of rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ associated with $\mathbb{HF}_*^{(\bullet,\bullet]}$. We observe that this rectangle barcode contains information about Usher's boundary depth and spectral invariants developed by Oh, Schwarz, and Viterbo. Moreover, we establish relevant stability results, particularly concerning the bottleneck distance and Hofer's distance.</description>
