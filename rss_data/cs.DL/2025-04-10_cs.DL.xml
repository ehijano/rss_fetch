      <title>Assessment of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) data implementation frameworks: a parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open science movement has established reproducibility, transparency, and validation of research outputs as essential norms for conducting scientific research. It advocates for open access to research outputs, especially research data, to enable verification of published findings and its optimum reuse. The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles support the philosophy of open science and have emerged as a foundational framework for making digital assets machine-actionable and enhancing their reusability and value in various domains, particularly in scientific research and data management. In response to the growing demand for making data FAIR, various FAIR implementation frameworks have been developed by various organizations to educate and make the scientific community more aware of FAIR and its principles and to make the adoption and implementation of FAIR easier. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the openly available FAIR implementation frameworks based on a parametric evaluation of these frameworks. The current work identifies 13 frameworks and compares them against their coverage of the four foundational principles of FAIR, including an assessment of these frameworks against 36 parameters related to technical specifications, basic features, and FAIR implementation features and FAIR coverage. The study identifies that most of the frameworks only offer a step-by-step guide to FAIR implementation and seem to be adopting the technology-first approach, mostly guiding the deployment of various tools for FAIR implementation. Many frameworks are missing the critical aspects of explaining what, why, and how for the four foundational principles of FAIR, giving less consideration to the social aspects of FAIR. The study concludes that more such frameworks should be developed, considering the people-first approach rather than the technology-first.</description>

      <title>Beyond authorship: Analyzing contributions in PLOS ONE and the challenges of appropriate attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of authorship attributions in scientific publications, focusing on the fairness and precision of individual contributions within academic works. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes 81,823 publications from the journal PLOS ONE , covering the period from January 2018 to June 2023. It examines the authorship attributions within these publications to try and determine the prevalence of inappropriate authorship. It also investigates the demographic and professional profiles of affected authors, exploring trends and potential factors contributing to inaccuracies in authorship. Findings Surprisingly, 9.14% of articles feature at least one author with inappropriate authorship, affecting over 14,000 individuals (2.56% of the sample). Inappropriate authorship is more concentrated in Asia, Africa, and specific European countries like Italy. Established researchers with significant publication records and those affiliated with companies or nonprofits show higher instances of potential monetary authorship. Research limitations Our findings are based on contributions as declared by the authors, which implies a degree of trust in their transparency. However, this reliance on self-reporting may introduce biases or inaccuracies into the dataset. Further research could employ additional verification methods to enhance the reliability of the findings. Practical implications These findings have significant implications for journal publishers, highlighting the necessity for robust control mechanisms to ensure the integrity of authorship attributions. Moreover, researchers must exercise discernment in determining when to acknowledge a contributor and when to include them in the author list. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining the credibility and fairness of academic publications. Originality/value This study contributes to an understanding of critical issues within academic authorship, shedding light on the prevalence and impact of inappropriate authorship attributions. By calling for a nuanced approach to ensure accurate credit is given where it is due, the study underscores the importance of upholding ethical standards in scholarly publishing.</description>
