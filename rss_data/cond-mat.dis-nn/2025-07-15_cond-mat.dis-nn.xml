      <title>A CLuP algorithm to practically achieve $\sim 0.76$ SK--model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically} approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be erased?
  Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover, running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov formulation of band theory for disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers, respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition. This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability for dense patterns in discrete attractor neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Machine Learning for Graph-based Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3) integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering, while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.</description>

      <title>Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations. This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>The Origin of the Gauge Theories of Glassy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical model of a glass-forming system is formulated within the formalism analogous to gauge theory constructions in quantum field theory. This work explores the scope of the proposed approach and investigates the equilibrium behavior of the model under the mean-field approximation. The analysis reveals three possible equilibrium scenarios, only one of which exhibits strong glass-forming ability. Additionally, an upper limit for the initial temperature is identified, beyond which quenching into the glassy state becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large system.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Evolution of Two-dimensional Carbon Nitride Research: Integrating Machine Learning into Conventional Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nitride research has reached a promising point in today's research endeavours with diverse applications including photocatalysis, energy storage, and sensing due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for exploring and optimizing the potential of these materials. This study presents a comprehensive review of the integration of ML techniques in carbon nitride research with an introduction to CN classifications and recent advancements. We discuss the methodologies employed, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, in predicting material properties, optimizing synthesis conditions, and enhancing performance metrics. Key findings indicate that ML algorithms can significantly reduce experimental trial-and-error, accelerate discovery processes, and provide deeper insights into the structure-property relationships of carbon nitride. The synergistic effect of combining ML with traditional experimental approaches is highlighted, showcasing studies where ML driven models have successfully predicted novel carbon nitride compositions with enhanced functional properties. Future directions in this field are also proposed, emphasizing the need for high-quality datasets, advanced ML models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the potential of carbon nitride materials in next-generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of circular unitary ensemble and their ratio: finite-size corrections and Riemann $\zeta$ zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of two consecutive eigenphase spacings and their ratio for Haar-distributed $\mathrm{U}(N)$ matrices (the circular unitary ensemble) using our framework for J\'{a}nossy densities in random matrix theory, formulated via the Tracy-Widom system of nonlinear PDEs. Our result shows that the leading finite-$N$ correction in the gap-ratio distribution relative to the universal sine-kernel limit is of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4})$, reflecting a nontrivial cancellation of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-2})$ part present in the joint distributions of consecutive spacings. This finding suggests the potential to extract subtle finite-size corrections from the energy spectra of quantum-chaotic systems and explains why the deviation of the gap-ratio distribution of the Riemann zeta zeros $\{1/2+i\gamma_n\}, \gamma_n\approx T\gg1$ from the sine-kernel prediction scales as $\left(\log(T/2\pi)\right)^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the zero temperature Edwards-Anderson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An Ising model with random couplings on a graph is a model of a spin glass. While the mean field case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is very well studied, the more realistic lattice setting, known as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has witnessed rather limited progress. In (Chatterjee,'23) chaotic properties of the ground state in the EA model were established via the study of the Fourier spectrum of the two-point spin correlation. A natural direction of research concerns fractal properties of the Fourier spectrum in analogy with critical percolation. In particular, numerical findings (Bray, Moore,'87) seem to support the belief that the fractal dimension of the associated spectral sample drawn according to the Fourier spectrum is strictly bigger than one. Towards this, in this note we introduce a percolation-type argument, relying on the construction of ``barriers'', to obtain new probabilistic lower bounds on the size of the spectral sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can simultaneously extract many quantitative features of a state including some traditional quantities such as entanglement depth, k-uniformity and entanglement entropy. Our method also presents an alternative computational tool for extracting the exact entanglement depth and all separable partitions of a stabilizer state. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Order in disorder: increased carrier mobility of downscaled amorphous semiconductors for high-speed thin film transistors in flexible electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous semiconductors are important channel semiconductors in thin film transistors (TFTs) which serve not only active-matrix displays, but also flexible electronics for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, a great limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities relative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established band fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous semiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling, without any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the intrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long gap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device uniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band tail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation length scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and medium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself. Overall, our results reveal that the properties of ancestral sequences - particularly their epistatic constraints - influence the initial evolutionary dynamics and the performance of standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Volume dependence of microwave induced excess quasiparticles in superconducting resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of quasiparticles typically degrades the performance of superconducting microwave circuits. The readout signal can generate non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which lead to excess microwave loss and decoherence. To understand this effect quantitatively, we measure quasiparticle fluctuations and extract the quasiparticle density across different temperatures, readout powers, and resonator volumes. We find that microwave power generates a higher quasiparticle density as the active resonator volume is reduced and show that this effect sets a sensitivity limit on kinetic inductance detectors. We compare our results with theoretical models of direct microwave photon absorption by quasiparticles and conclude that an unknown, indirect mechanism plays a dominant role in quasiparticle generation. These results provide a route to mitigate quasiparticle generation due to readout power in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>
